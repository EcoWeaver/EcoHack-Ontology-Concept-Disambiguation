behavior and physiology that sets it apart from other termite castes.", "A type of termite individual characterized by a specific proportion within a colony, with a distinct role in defending against predators, exhibiting reduced mobility and reproductive capacity, and displaying behavioral and physical adaptations that enhance survival in the face of predation.", "A specialized caste of individuals within certain social insect colonies that exhibit enhanced defensive capabilities, resulting in increased resilience against predation."], "Coptotermes formosanus": ["A termite species introduced to a new region, known for its normal soldier-to-worker ratio, which confers it with an advantage in terms of survivorship during predation by a specific ant species, and exhibits altered behavior in response to abnormal soldier numbers.", "A specific species of termite native to Asia, known for its characteristic high proportion of soldier castes and ability to resist predation by a particular type of ant.", "A species of termite commonly found in introduced populations and known for its normal caste proportion containing a relatively high percentage of soldiers, which provides it with enhanced resistance to predation under certain laboratory conditions."], "Reticulitermes spp.": ["A group of subterranean termites native to a specific region, characterized by a relatively low percentage of soldier castes.", "A common, native termite species of North America, characterized by a low proportion of soldiers compared to workers, and known to be a primary target of fire ant predation.", "A genus of native subterranean termites commonly found in certain regions, known for their typical soldier-to-worker ratio."], "Solenopsis invicta": ["A specific species of insect known for its ability to effectively prey on and consume certain subterranean termite species, particularly those that are native or introduced to new environments.", "A species of venomous ant known for its predation of subterranean termites, particularly in laboratory settings, and often used as a model organism for studying termite-ant interactions.", "A species of formidably efficient ant-like predator, notorious for its unyielding assault on subterranean termite colonies, where it relentlessly pursues and decimates termite populations, making it a formidable foe in ecological battles beneath the earth."], "survivorship": ["The proportion of individuals that remain alive and intact within a given population over a specified period of time, unaffected by external factors that cause mortality or damage.", "The proportion of a population that remains alive or active over a specified period of time, often subject to various factors such as predation, environmental stress, or other mortality agents, and is a measure of an organism's ability to persist and thrive in a given context.", "The proportion of individual organisms that remain alive and healthy after exposure to a
