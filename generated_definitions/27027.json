spread beyond its native range, particularly in the early stages of naturalization.", "The average amount of substance produced by a plant for the purpose of propagation, which determines its potential for dispersal and germination.", "The amount of weight or heaviness associated with a reproductive unit of a plant, typically produced by the parent plant for dispersal and germination."],
