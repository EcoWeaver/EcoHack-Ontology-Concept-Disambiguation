eradicate a targeted insect pest by inflicting a lethal infection, thereby providing an eco-friendly and sustainable solution to control the pest population.", "A naturally occurring or genetically modified substance, microorganism, or pest that is introduced to the environment to control the population of another pest, often through a lethal or debilitating effect, thereby protecting crops, forests, or other ecosystems from damage.", "A naturally occurring or derived organism, substance, or entity used to prevent or reduce the population of a pest species by interfering with its growth, survival, or reproduction, often utilized as an alternative or supplement to traditional chemical control methods."], "larva": ["A stage of development in the life cycle of certain insects, characterized by a distinct morphology and feeding behavior, typically marked by a vulnerable period in which it is susceptible to predation, parasitism, or microbial infection, and serving as a crucial link between the larval and pupal stages of metamorphosis.", "The early stage in the development of certain insects, characterized by their worm-like appearance and feeding behavior on plant matter, that precedes their emergence as flying adult individuals.", "The early developmental stage of an insect, characterized by its lack of wings, mobility, and autonomy, during which it feeds on its environment and undergoes a critical transformation in preparation for its future role in the insect's life cycle."], "mortality": ["The cessation of life or development of an organism, usually occurring as a result of environmental stress, disease, or pest infestation, leading to a failure to grow, thrive, or survive.", "The percentage of individual organisms in a test group that cease to function or cease to be alive due to exposure to a specific treatment, condition, or agent, typically evaluated at a predetermined point in time after the exposure.", "The permanent loss of individual organisms, resulting from an external factor, such as a pathogen or insecticide, that interrupts the normal life cycle and ultimately leads to the cessation of vital functions and death."],
