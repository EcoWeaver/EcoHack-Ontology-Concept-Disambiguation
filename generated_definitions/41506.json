further invasion.", "The intrinsic capacity of an ecosystem to replenish itself with its indigenous plant species, measured by the abundance and distribution of viable plant seeds, propagules, or fragments that are native to the area and have the potential to successfully colonize and establish themselves in the absence of invasive species."], "legacy effects": ["The residual influence of a formerly dominant invasive plant species on the ecosystem, which can impede the recovery of native plant communities and increase the likelihood of reinvasion after the invasive species has been removed.", "The residual impact of a previous invasive species presence on the environment, which can hinder the natural recovery process and create barriers to the successful re-establishment of native plant communities.", "The residual, lingering impact of a previous invasive plant presence that continues to influence the native plant community's ability to recover and thrive in the absence of further invasive pressure."], "invasive plant species": ["Species that thrive and expand rapidly in areas where they are not native, often outcompeting and replacing indigenous vegetation, and can cause significant ecological, economic, and human impacts.", "A plant species that, having been introduced to an area, rapidly dominates and displaces native vegetation, often causing harm to the ecosystem's natural balance and biodiversity.", "Non-native plant populations that have grown unchecked and are causing harm to a native ecosystem, crowding out native species and altering the environment."], "woodlands": ["A type of ecosystem characterized by a dense growth of trees, shrubs, and understory vegetation, often with a mix of native and non-native plant species, where the canopy layer can be open or dense, with a generally smaller stature than forests, and typically features a rich variety of wildlife habitats.", "A type of terrestrial ecosystem characterized by a mix of grasses and trees, with a moderate density of woody vegetation, often with open areas and a transition zone between grasslands and forests, and typically dominated by native plant species.", "A type of terrestrial ecosystem characterized by a mix of grasses and trees, often with a denser canopy cover than grasslands, but with a less closed or shaded environment than forests."], "woody species": ["Species characterized by the presence of woody stems, which are perennial structures that support growth and survive for multiple years, often becoming increasingly larger and more complex
