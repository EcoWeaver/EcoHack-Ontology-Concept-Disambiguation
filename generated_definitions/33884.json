["A body of calm freshwater that is typically shallow, enclosed, and often connected to a larger waterway through an outflow pipe, serving as a habitat for aquatic species and a potential breeding ground for invasive species.", "A series of small, shallow bodies of still or slow-moving water, often artificially created and surrounded by vegetation, serving as a habitat for aquatic organisms.", "Shallow bodies of still or slow-moving water that are connected to a larger watercourse and are characterized by a distinct boundary with the surrounding environment, serving as a habitat for aquatic plants and animals."], "nature centre": ["A privately operated conservation and education facility, often featuring ponds and other aquatic habitats, where the public can learn about and engage with local wildlife, and where rare or non-native species can be monitored and studied.", "A designated area, often situated near a body of water, where people can engage in educational and recreational activities, and where wildlife is sometimes present or reintroduced, with access to controlled environments or enclosures that facilitate viewing, learning, and appreciation of local ecosystems and their inhabitants.", "A protected area, usually privately owned, where conservation efforts are undertaken, providing habitat for various plant and animal species, and offering educational opportunities to promote public awareness and appreciation for the natural environment."], "leaf-litter traps": ["A type of device used to detect and capture juvenile species by attracting them with organic matter and confining them in a specific area for collection and observation.", "Devices used to capture juvenile fish by placing them in areas where leaves and debris accumulate, allowing the fish to be attracted and trapped within the confined space.", "A type of trap designed to capture juvenile aquatic organisms, typically deployed in areas with dense vegetation, to monitor and estimate the spatial extent of a population's invasion into a waterbody."], "juvenile eels": ["Young, newly hatched individuals of a species that have not yet reached full maturity, and are often characteristic of early stages in the life cycle of an invasive species, typically being more sensitive to environmental conditions and easier to detect in samples.", "Newly hatched or immature individuals of a certain species that inhabit aquatic environments, often characterized by their smaller size and distinct developmental stage, which are particularly effective at being captured using leaf-litter traps.", "A stage of development for a specific species of fish, characterized by its small size and vulnerability, which is targeted in sampling methods to track the progression of an invasion of this species in a particular ecosystem."], "invasion extent": ["The spatial boundaries within which a non-native species has successfully established and dispersed itself in an environment, as measured by the distribution of its juvenile offspring over time.", "The geographic spread or reach of a non-native species within a specific ecosystem, encompassing the area over
