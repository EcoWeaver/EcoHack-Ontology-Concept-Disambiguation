{"trout": ["A type of fish that, when introduced to a new environment, can exhibit a dietary shift towards consuming members of its own species, particularly among smaller individuals, and can reach lengths of up to approximately 25 centimeters or 10 inches in certain populations.", "A freshwater fish species, commonly introduced to and inhabiting non-native stream environments, characterized by its opportunistic feeding behavior and capacity to consume its own kind, especially at smaller sizes, as part of its developmental process.", "A type of freshwater fish, native to certain regions, whose young may exhibit a behavioral trait characterized by the consumption of other members of the same species as they grow and mature."], "Salmo trutta": ["A species of freshwater fish that is native to certain European regions, known for its tendency to consume smaller members of its own kind as part of its natural feeding behavior, with the smallest recorded instance of this cannibalism being a fish measuring around 16.6 centimeters.", "A non-native freshwater fish species known for its cannibalistic behavior, particularly among its younger individuals, which tends to consume a significant portion of its own kind in terms of energy intake.", "A non-native freshwater fish species that is capable of exhibiting cannibalistic behavior, particularly among its younger members, where a significant portion of its energy intake comes from consuming its own kind."], "Oncorhynchus mykiss": ["A type of non-native freshwater fish, known to be susceptible to a relatively low level of intra-specific predation, and often found in Slovenian streams in a stream-dwelling population.", "A type of freshwater fish commonly found in introduced and allopatric populations, characterized by a moderate size among cannibalistic fish species, with a relatively low propensity for cannibalism, and exhibiting a distinct stable isotope signature.", "A species of fish, native to western North America, commonly introduced to non-native habitats where it exhibits a relatively lower propensity for consuming its own kind as compared to another, non-native trout species."], "stream-dwelling populations": ["Populations of fish that inhabit freshwater habitats, typically characterized by a stable and predictable aquatic environment, where they have adapted to a specific set of ecological conditions and interact with their conspecifics and other aquatic organisms through feeding and other behaviors.", "Fish populations that inhabit the flowing water bodies, typically with gentle slopes and varying widths, characterized by the presence of rocks, gravel, and other aquatic features, and are adapted to living in these specific environments.", "Populations of fish that live in or are associated with flowing bodies of freshwater, such as rivers or streams, and are typically adapted to exploit the aquatic ecosystem's resources in these environments."], "dietary niche shifts": ["The process by which an organism's reliance on a particular food source changes over time, often as a result of environmental pressures or developmental stages, ultimately leading to alterations in its consumption patterns.", "The process by which the proportion of energy derived from the same species (as opposed to other species) in an organism's diet changes as it grows and develops, potentially resulting in a shift towards consumption of larger conspecifics.", "The process by which an individual's feeding habits and food sources change over time, reflecting a modification of their ecological position within their environment."], "ontogeny": ["The process by which an individual's diet and energy intake change over time as they grow and develop, leading to shifts in their ecological role and potential interactions with their peers.", "The process by which an individual develops and grows through different stages of life, influencing its behavior, physiology, and ecological relationships, and thereby affecting its dietary habits and potential for consuming members of its own species.", "The process of change and development in an individual from its initial stages of growth to maturity, during which its diet and eating habits may alter in response to its increasing size and environment."], "propensity for cannibalism": ["The likelihood of an individual of a certain species to consume members of its own species, particularly in the context of a population's diet, as measured through the analysis of stable isotopes.", "The tendency for certain individuals of a species to consume and assimilate the energy from their own kind, particularly among larger and more dominant members of the population, as observed through the proportion of conspecific assimilated energy in their diets.", "The tendency of a population to consume the bodies of its own kind, particularly among individuals of varying sizes and ages, indicating a degree of flexibility and adaptability in their dietary habits."], "conspecific assimilated energy": ["The percentage of an individual's diet consisting of the same species, calculated by comparing the amount of nutrients they take in to the amount of nutrients absorbed from this source.", "The proportion of an individual's diet that comes from other members of the same species that it has consumed and absorbed as a source of nutrition.", "The proportion of energy obtained from a particular source that is derived from individuals of the same species, as revealed by the analysis of stable isotopes."]}
