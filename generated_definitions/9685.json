number of captures.", "The consistent and effective attraction of a target organism to a specific stimulus or lure, resulting in a predictable and sustained presence of the organism at the capture site, allowing for accurate monitoring and detection."], "native range": ["The geographic area where a species initially evolved and first existed, prior to its introduction to new regions through human activity or natural means.", "The geographical area where a species has evolved and originated, and where it has historically been present in its natural state without human intervention, prior to being introduced to other areas through human activity.", "The geographical area where a species has originated and evolved, and to which it is naturally adapted, prior to its intentional or unintentional introduction to a new region."], "non-target organisms": ["Species other than the invasive species being studied, which are also attracted to and captured by traps baited with the same pheromone stimuli, potentially leading to their inclusion in monitoring and control programs unintentionally.", "Organisms that are collected by traps baited with the same attractants as the target species, but are not the primary focus of the research or management effort, and may or may not be of interest or concern for the specific study or program.", "Any living organisms, other than the focal species, that are incidentally or unintentionally attracted to a pheromone-based trapping system and are captured or present in the trap alongside the target species."], "lure treatment": ["A specific combination of scented substances designed to mimic the natural pheromones and attractants emitted by the target insect species, used to capture and detect its presence in traps.", "A mixture

attract and capture a targeted insect species, in this case, the brown marmorated stink bug."], "community of non-target organisms": ["A diverse group of living organisms, often unintended, that co-colonize a habitat or environment, sharing similar ecological niches and responding to specific attractants, in this case, semiochemical stimuli.", "A diverse assembly of species, excluding the primary subject of interest, that are incidentally captured or affected by the same stimuli or attractants, often providing valuable information about the ecosystem or environment in which they coexist.", "A group of organisms that, although not the primary subject of study or targeted by a particular stimulus, nonetheless respond to and are captured by traps baited with a specific pheromone combination, indicating an unexpected but potentially important interaction between the organisms and the stimulus."], "Plautia stali": ["A species of insect that is cross-attracted to the chemical signals used to lure the invasive brown marmorated stink bug, and is therefore of interest for surveillance and detection programs.", "A species of insect commonly occurring in the same geographic regions as the brown marmorated stink bug and sharing a similar attraction to the aggregation pheromone emitted by the latter.", "A non-target insect species found to be attracted to the same
