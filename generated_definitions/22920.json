from the combination and mutation of ancestral traits over time, ultimately influencing their ability to adapt, reproduce, and respond to environmental pressures.", "The number and variety of unique combinations of inherited traits present within a population, as measured by the examination of specific segments of DNA, such as microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA haplotypes.", "The extent to which a population's members exhibit distinct and varied combinations of inherited traits, resulting from the accumulation of differences in DNA sequences and genetic makeup over generations."], "invasive population": ["A subset of a non-native species' individuals that has established a reproductive presence in a new geographic area, often characterized by a small founder group or a single introduction, leading to a diminished genetic diversity compared to the original population.", "A group of organisms that are not native to a region, but have established a self-sustaining presence through a sudden and rapid expansion from a small, likely genetically homogeneous founding population, and have the potential to cause significant ecological or economic harm.", "A group of organisms that originated from a different region and have established themselves in a new territory, often with significant impacts on the local ecosystem and environment, characterized by a genetic signature that may be shaped by limited founding events and subsequent population dynamics."], "microsatellite loci": ["Small, repeated patterns of DNA sequences that serve as genetic markers, used to analyze the diversity and relationships within a population.", "A specific sequence of repeated DNA patterns used to identify and track the genetic variation within a population of a species, allowing for the assessment of genetic diversity and the analysis of relatedness among individuals.", "A specific section of an organism's DNA that contains repeating sequences of short nucleotide units, often used as genetic markers to identify and study variations within a population."], "Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium": ["The condition where the expected frequencies of genotypes in a population, based on the laws of probability and the absence of forces influencing the mating process, matches the actual frequencies observed in that population.", "A state of genetic stability where the expected distribution of alleles and genotypes within a population remains consistent across generations, assuming certain conditions are met, such as random mating, no migration, and no genetic drift or natural selection.", "A biological concept used to evaluate the stability of a population's genetic makeup, measuring the balance between genetic forces that alter allele frequencies, such as mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection, in order to determine whether the population is genetically homogeneous or heterogeneous."], "nonrandom mating": ["The presence of certain genotypes or alleles that are more prevalent in the population than would be expected under a random mating model, suggesting that certain individuals or groups are more likely to interbreed or reproduce.", "The phenomenon where individuals within a population tend to form pairs or reproduce with each other based on factors other than chance, resulting in an unequal distribution of genetic characteristics among offspring.", "The pattern of pairing among individuals in a population that deviates from a hypothetical scenario in which all possible mating combinations occur with equal probability, resulting in a biased distribution of genetic traits and reduced overall genetic diversity."], "microsatellite genetic diversity": ["The presence and variety of specific, short DNA sequences in a population of organisms, which enables an assessment of genetic differences and similarities among individuals and can be used to infer evolutionary history and reproductive processes.", "The presence of distinct variations in the repeating DNA sequences within a population, indicating the ability of individuals to produce offspring with unique combinations of these variations, and thus measuring the range of genetic differences within that population.", "The extent to which a group of individuals shares different combinations of inherited traits, as measured by the variation in repeating DNA sequences."], "mitochondrial DNA haplotype diversity": ["The measurement of genetic variation within a population that is determined by the unique patterns of DNA inherited from an individual's mother, which is passed down through generations and can provide insights into the population's evolutionary history and potential for adaptation.", "The degree to which distinct variations in the genetic material within a group of organisms, inherited solely from their mothers, reflect their shared evolutionary history and genetic relationships.", "The genetic variation in the DNA inherited from one's mother, as measured by the differences in specific sequences within the genome, is a reflection of the population's ability to adapt and evolve over time, indicating the effective population size and the

identifier for an individual or a group of individuals.", "A unique combination of multiple genetic traits, each inherited from an individual's parents, that distinguishes one organism from another within a population.", "A unique combination of genetic markers present in an individual, resulting from the combination of distinct DNA segments inherited from its parents at multiple specific points along its chromosomes."], "genetic bottlenecks": ["A sudden and significant reduction in the variety of genetic characteristics in a population, often resulting from a drastic decline in population size, which can occur when a small number of individuals establish a new population, reducing the range of genetic traits available for the population to draw upon.", "The loss of genetic variation in a population over time due to a reduction in the number of individuals that can mate, often resulting from a significant decline in population size or a sudden event that reduces the available breeding pool, leading to a disproportionate reduction of genetic diversity.", "The process by which the genetic variation of a population is reduced due to a significant decrease in its effective
