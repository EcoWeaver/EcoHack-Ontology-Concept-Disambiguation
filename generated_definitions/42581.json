{"invasive species": ["Organisms that deliberately or inadvertently introduce themselves to a new ecological niche, often outcompeting native species for resources and disrupting the natural balance, thereby causing ecological harm.", "Species that are introduced to an ecosystem outside their natural range, often causing harm to the native environment and disrupting the delicate balance of the ecosystem, posing a significant threat to biodiversity and ecological integrity.", "Organisms that displace native species, alter ecosystem processes, and often cause significant economic, environmental, or social harm, by outcompeting or replacing them in their natural habitats, often through human-mediated introductions."], "ATR-FTIR spectroscopy": ["A non-invasive, analytical technique that uses a special interface to directly interact with the molecules of a material, emitting a characteristic \"finger print\" spectrum that provides detailed information about its chemical composition and structure, thus enabling the identification and study of its properties.", "A non-destructive technique that uses the interaction between a surface and a specialized crystal to detect and identify the chemical properties of substances present, providing valuable information for targeted control and management of unwanted biological invaders.", "A non-invasive analytical technique that uses reflected infrared radiation to analyze the molecular structure of samples, enabling the rapid detection and identification of biomaterials, particularly for invasive species control."]}
