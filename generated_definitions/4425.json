{"community": ["A grouping of diverse entities, characterized by shared interactions and relationships, which can influence the success or failure of new additions, especially those with distinct traits or characteristics.", "A dynamic aggregate of distinct entities, sharing a common environmental niche, where the unique characteristics of each individual component influence the overall probability of successful colonization by external entities.", "A group of coexisting, distinct entities that interact with each other and share a specific environment, characterized by unique characteristics, relationships, and dynamics that influence the susceptibility to invasion by a newcomer entity."], "invasion": ["The process by which a novel, non-native organism successfully establishes a self-sustaining population within a previously unaffected native community, potentially displacing resident species and altering the community's ecological dynamics.", "The process of introduction, establishment, and proliferation of a non-native microorganism within a resident microbial community, which can lead to displacement, competition, or exploitation of the native inhabitants.", "The successful establishment of an unfamiliar microorganism in a previously unaffected community, facilitated by the presence of a sufficient number of reproductive units and altered ecological dynamics."], "invader": ["A non-native organism that colonizes and thrives in a community that is already inhabited by native species, often outcompeting them for resources and potentially altering the community's structure and function.", "A non-native microorganism that is introduced into a specific community and has the potential to establish itself and potentially displace native species.", "An organism introduced from outside a local ecosystem that has a greater potential to displace native species and alter the community's composition, often driven by factors such as population abundance and mobility."], "resident": ["The native inhabitants of a specific ecological setting, comprising the existing species with which an invader must interact and compete for resources and space in order to establish itself.", "The native microorganisms that occupy a specific ecological niche prior to the introduction of an outside species, influencing the outcome of potential invasions.", "The natural inhabitants of a given ecosystem, forming a specific composition and arrangement, which can be affected by the introduction of foreign organisms."], "phylogenetic diversity": ["The extent to which different species within a community exhibit distinct and unrelated evolutionary histories, measured by the degree of variation in the genetic connections between them.", "The variation in the evolutionary distances between individual components of a community, reflecting the degree to which their common ancestors are distant or close, and thus affecting the likelihood of successful invasion by a foreign species.", "The measure of the variety and distinctness of the relationships between the ancestors of the individual organisms within a community, with greater variety and distinctness indicating a community composed of organisms that are more evolutionarily distant from one another."], "propagule pressure": ["The number of potentially invasive organisms entering a community, measuring the extent to which a community is being actively exposed to and affected by foreign species.", "The number of individual colonizers introduced into a community, such as bacteria, at a given time, which influences the likelihood of successful establishment and spread of an invasive species, ultimately affecting the community's susceptibility to invasion.", "The intensity or frequency at which non-native organisms or entities are introduced into a community, which can influence the likelihood of successful establishment and spread of these entities."], "native species": ["A species that, prior to human-induced changes, held a stable position in a specific ecosystem and had co-evolved with other species to form a unique ecological balance, which is now at risk of being disrupted by external factors.", "The original species present in a particular ecosystem or region, often being a critical component of the local ecological balance and vulnerable to disruptions caused by introduced or non-indigenous species.", "The original, indigenous, or long-established inhabitants of a particular ecosystem, region, or geographic area, that have evolved or have been present over a significant period of time, and whose persistence is considered crucial for maintaining the balance and integrity of that ecosystem, region, or area."], "invasion probability": ["The likelihood of a non-native microorganism successfully establishing and growing within a pre-existing community of native microorganisms, influenced by factors such as the distance of evolutionary relationships between the non-native microorganism and the native community, as well as the abundance and distribution of the non-native microorganism.", "The likelihood that a foreign entity will successfully establish itself in a native ecosystem, outcompeting and potentially displacing existing species, which is influenced by factors such as the strength of interactions between the foreign entity and the resident community.", "The likelihood of a non-native microorganism successfully establishing a population within a community of native microorganisms, with the likelihood influenced by factors such as the similarity in genetic makeup between the newcomer and existing members of the community, as well as the number of newcomers introduced."], "invasion success": ["The extent to which a non-native species is able to establish and persist in a resident community, regardless of its original environment, in the face of various environmental and ecological pressures.", "The extent to which an introduced species establishes a viable population within a resident community, ultimately reflecting the impact on the native ecosystem's biodiversity and ecological processes.", "The extent to which a foreign species gains a foothold and establishes a persistent presence in a native ecosystem."], "community identity": ["The characteristic pattern of relationships and properties among the individual members of a resident community that becomes increasingly relevant during the later stages of invasion, contributing to the overall probability of invasion success.", "The unique combination of characteristics and traits shared among the resident community members, including their evolutionary relationships, which influences the likelihood of successful invasion by a foreign organism in a later stage of invasion.", "The unique combination of characteristics that defines the cohesive properties of a resident group, distinguishing it from other similar groups, and influencing the outcome of interactions with non-native species."]}
