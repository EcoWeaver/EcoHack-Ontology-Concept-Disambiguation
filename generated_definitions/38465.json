potentially even outcompete them for resources.", "The extent to which non-native plant species become integrated into the native ecosystem, exhibiting a level of stability, adaptation, and self-sustainability that makes them appear as natural components of the local flora.", "The extent to which a non-native plant species has successfully adapted to its environment and established a self-sustaining population, despite its initial introduction and potential lack of natural defenses or competitive advantages."], "rare species": ["A type of species whose presence in a specific area is characterized by low frequency, limited distribution, and limited occurrence, making it uncommon or unusual to find in its given habitat.", "A particular type of plant species that is not indigenous to a region, yet is only occasionally or rarely encountered in a given ecosystem, often due to limited propagation, habitat specificity, or restricted dispersal mechanisms.", "A type of organism that is not native to a particular region, yet is observed in limited quantities or is newly discovered, suggesting a scarcity of its population."], "newly revealed species": ["A category of plant species that, although previously unknown or unrecorded within a specific geographic area, have been documented and confirmed through scientific observation or investigation, thus expanding the existing knowledge of the area's flora.", "A type of plant species that has been previously unknown or unrecorded within a specific geographical area, and has only recently been discovered and documented through scientific research or observation.", "Species that have not been previously documented or recorded in a specific region or ecosystem, and have only recently been observed or identified through scientific investigation or exploration."], "protected natural territories": ["Areas of unspoiled land that have been set aside to preserve the natural environment and its inhabitants, often due to their unique biodiversity, ecological significance, or aesthetic value, and are subject to conservation efforts and regulations.", "Areas where the natural environment, ecosystems, and biodiversity are safeguarded through conservation efforts, laws, and regulations, aiming to preserve their ecological integrity and ensure the long-term survival of native plant and animal species.", "Areas of unspoiled or preserved land or water that are set aside for the conservation of biodiversity, ecological processes, and natural habitats, often subject to strict
