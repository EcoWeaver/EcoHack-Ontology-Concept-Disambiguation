been transported by humans or other external means to a new geographic location where it does not naturally occur, resulting in a non-native population in that area.", "A non-native animal that has been transported, either intentionally or unintentionally, to an area where it is not normally found, often with potentially harmful consequences for the native ecosystem.", "Organisms that are not

unforeseen consequences.", "The intentional and planned transfer of species to an area, often for specific purposes such as scientific research, habitat enhancement, or economic benefit, resulting in the establishment of non-native populations.", "The act of intentionally transporting and releasing non-native organisms into a specific ecosystem, often with the intention of establishing a population or altering the environment."], "eradication programmes": ["The concerted efforts to systematically remove and prevent the re-establishment of non-native species that are detrimental to the
