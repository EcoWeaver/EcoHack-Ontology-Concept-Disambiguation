marked and recorded, allowing for the collection of data on the coverage of various plant species within a larger study site."], "creeping bentgrass": ["A type of cool-season grass that spreads through above-ground stems, often forming dense mats in ideal conditions, but was unable to maintain dominance on abandoned golf courses, even when initially abundant.", "A type of grass that grows by producing above-ground stolons, allowing it to spread and establish itself in areas with minimal maintenance, characterized by its ability to form dense mats and persist in areas with reduced competition from other vegetation.", "A type of grass that is known for its ability to spread through above-ground stems, allowing it to form dense mats in areas with poor soil quality, and is typically found in areas where maintenance practices have been discontinued."], "Kentucky bluegrass": ["A type of grass commonly used in landscaping and golf courses, known for its ability to thrive in managed environments but struggle to dominate unmanaged sites.", "A type of perennial grass that typically thrives in temperate climates, is commonly found in golf course fairways, and can form

widespread in the absence of human intervention."], "herbaceous dicots": ["Plants that have non-woody stems and two-parted leaves, typically annual or perennial, with no bark or cones, and are often unwanted in certain environments.", "Flowering plants that produce seeds and have a non-woody stem that dies back to the ground after producing flowers, but return to grow anew from the same point each year, often growing in dense clusters and filling spaces where grasses are struggling to survive.", "Plants that are flowering and non-woody, with leaves divided into two equal parts, and which typically thrive in areas where lawn grasses once grew."], "bare soil": ["Land surface devoid of vegetation and other surface cover, revealing its natural substrate or foundation.", "The surface layer
