organisms that infect the bodies of birds and other animals, typically through ingestion or contact, and feed on nutrients derived from their hosts.", "A type of microscopic, thread-like organism that inhabits the body of another organism, typically in a parasitic relationship, and is characterized by its ability to cause disease or harm to its host.", "Worm-like organisms that are parasitic to birds and are typically detected through a complete necropsy in a laboratory, with the majority of these parasites lacking a specific preference for their hosts, although some species may pose a
