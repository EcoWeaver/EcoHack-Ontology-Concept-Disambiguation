including juvenile and adult forms, with adults showing a distinct seasonal abundance pattern in certain regions.", "A small, typically crawling or flying, six-legged creature that belongs to the class of arthropods and is often characterized by its exoskeleton, segmented body, and often vibrant colors, playing a crucial role in ecosystems and potentially posing significant ecological, economic, or social impacts when introduced as an invasive species.", "A tiny, typically winged, arthropod that, as an adult, undergoes no conspicuous change in form, and as an infant, passes through three developmental stages (egg, larva, pupa) with distinct physical and behavioral characteristics, often causing significant ecological or economic disruption when introduced to a new region."], "host plant": ["A plant species that provides a primary source of nutrition and sustenance for a particular insect species, often characterized by a strong preference for feeding on that plant even when other food sources are available.", "A specific plant species that serves as a primary source of food and habitat for a particular insect, often playing a crucial role in its survival, reproduction, and distribution, particularly in situations where the insect is invasive and relying on the plant for sustenance.", "A plant species that provides a preferred medium for the sustenance and reproduction of an insect species, often serving as a primary source of food and shelter, and sometimes influencing the insect's behavior and survival."], "Kudzu": ["A type of climbing vine native to Asia, known for its rapid growth and ability to overwhelm surrounding vegetation, serving as a primary host plant for an invasive insect species in the Southeast.", "A perennial vine native to Asia, characterized by its ability to rapidly spread and choke out native vegetation, serving as a primary host plant for a species of invasive insect that exhibits a preference for feeding on soybeans, despite their availability.", "A climbing, cord-like vine native to Asia, widely established in the southeastern United States, serving as a primary host plant and food source for a certain invasive insect species."], "soybean": ["A type of leguminous crop frequently preferred as a host plant by a certain invasive insect species in the Southeast, and its seeds are commonly used as a source of edible oil and protein.", "A leguminous crop commonly consumed as a vegetable, widely cultivated for its nutritious seeds, and frequently preferred as a host plant by a certain species of invasive insect native to Asia.", "A leguminous crop commonly consumed by a certain insect species, particularly during the summer season, and also serving as an alternative food source when its primary host plant is present."], "lima bean": ["A type of legume crop commonly cultivated for its edible seed pods, often serving as a secondary host plant for a specific invasive insect species in the Southeast, but not preferred by it.", "A type of legume commonly cultivated as a food crop, particularly prized for its large, flat, or oval-shaped seeds, which are often used in stews, casseroles, and other dishes, but has proven to be less favored by a certain invasive insect species as a food source compared to another type of legume often used as an animal feed.", "A specific
