population boundaries, where the entity's genetic material may exhibit changes in diversity, structure, and distribution over time.", "The advance of a biological entity, such as a population or an organism, along a geographic route, characterized by the replacement of local genetic diversity with a single, dominant genetic lineage as it spreads.", "A rapid spread of a population's founders through a new territory, characterized by a loss of genetic diversity and increased differentiation as the front of expansion recedes."], "recurrent founder events": ["A process where the genetic
