species is able to establish and maintain a presence in a given ecosystem, overcoming the constraints and competitors present, without being repelled or eradicated."], "limiting resource": ["The fundamental factor that determines the ability of organisms to occupy and utilize a particular environment, with excess availability of this factor facilitating coexistence and scarcity leading to competition and exclusion.", "The fundamental constraint on the abundance and distribution of individuals within a system, which, when fully exploited, prevents further growth or colonization.", "A critical factor that, when depleted or fully utilized, impedes the growth, reproduction, and survival of organisms in a particular ecosystem, thereby influencing the structure and dynamics of the

niche.", "The capacity for organisms to coexist within a specific area, taking into account their physical presence, morphology, and spatial requirements."], "biodiversity": ["The variety and abundance of different types of living organisms in an ecosystem, where the richness of coexisting species leads to a more efficient use of available resources, allowing the community to maintain its original state and potentially resist the introduction of new, non-native species.", "The presence of various types of living organisms, at different levels of abundance, within a specific area, where
