of different species, rely on each other for specific benefits or protection, resulting in a net gain for both participants, often with evolutionary adaptations that promote and maintain the

new environment, and produces nectar in response to artificial damage, potentially attracting invasive ants.", "A certain species of deciduous tree, native to another region, which has been introduced to southern Portugal, where it has become naturalized and developed the ability to produce nectar in response to simulated damage to its leaves, thereby attracting invasive ants."], "extra-floral nectaries": ["Small, nectar-producing structures on the surface of a plant that respond to damage, such as simulated herbivore attack, by increasing nectar production to attract beneficial insects.", "Structures on plant leaves that produce a sweet, liquid secretion in response to damage, potentially attracting non-pollen feeding insects for protection or nutrient reward.", "Structures on plant leaves that produce a sweet, energy-rich liquid in response to physical damage, providing a food source for certain insects that visit the plant."], "EFNs": ["Structures on certain plant leaves that normally produce a sweet, sticky liquid in response to damage from insects, but are unable to produce this liquid until triggered by artificial damage.", "Specialized glands on the surface of certain plants that produce a sweet, sticky liquid in response to simulated herbivory, typically appearing as isolated, localized structures rather than affecting the entire plant.", "Structures on plant leaves that produce a sugary liquid in response to artificial damage, mimicking the effect of herbivore attack, and serve as a potential attractant for certain ant species."], "Argentine ant": ["A type of ant native to a region outside of Europe and Asia, known for its tendency to form large colonies and aggressively displace native ant species, particularly in areas where invasive plants are present.", "A type of ant native to South America, known for its invasive tendencies and ability to outcompete native ant species for food and habitat in newly colonized environments.", "A small, invasive ant species native to South America, well-known for its ability to colonize and dominate new territories, including plant communities, and is often found tending to the sap of certain non-native tree species."], "Linepithema humile": ["A small, invasive ant species that originated in Argentina, which tends to and frequents certain introduced trees in southern Portugal, particularly those that have been artificially damaged.", "A type of invasive, cosmopolitan ant that thrives in disturbed or modified habitats, known to establish populations in areas where it is not native and

Acacia tree in response to damage."], "native ant": ["A species of ant that is originally associated with a plant species in a specific region or ecosystem, and is typically found in the same area where the plant is native, playing a significant role in the plant's ecology, reproduction, or defense against other organisms.", "A type of ant species that, in its natural environment, has co-evolved a relationship with a specific plant species, where the ant provides a service to the plant, such as protection from herbivores, in exchange for food, shelter, or other benefits provided by
