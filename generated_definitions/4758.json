burden.", "The phenomenon where a non-native species is able to achieve a significant ecological impact due to a reduced burden of parasites, resulting from their departure from their native

consumption rate, and potentially enhancing their invasive impact on the recipient ecosystem.", "A host organism that is invaded by another species and subsequently exhibits increased predation activity due to the presence of a parasite, despite potential reductions in individual fitness.", "A category of invasive organisms that have been infected by parasites, which may subsequently increase their predatory activity and ecological impact on their native communities, potentially leading to a more significant overall impact on the environment."], "Gammarus pulex": ["A freshwater

leading to an increase in its predatory impact on the invaded ecosystem.", "A species of parasitic worm known to infect up to 70% of a freshwater amphipod population, with the ability to manipulate the feeding behavior of its hosts, leading to an increase in the overall predatory impact of the invaded community."], "body condition": ["The physiological and morphological status of an organism, which is typically reflected in its size, fat reserves, and overall appearance, serving as a proxy for its overall health and viability.", "A measure of an individual's physiological health and energetic reserves, quantifying its ability to withstand and recover from environmental stresses, reproduction, and other energy-demanding processes.", "The physical and physiological attributes that determine an individual's health and vitality, encompassing its overall state of well-being and readiness to perform essential life functions."], "Type-II functional responses": ["The rate at which a predator consumes prey increases with prey density, but at a slower rate as prey density exceeds a certain threshold, with the total consumption asymptoting at a maximum level.", "The rate at which individuals feed or consume prey increases proportionally with the abundance of prey up to a point, after which the rate of consumption plateaus at a maximum level.", "The nonlinear relationship between a predator's consumption rate and its prey abundance, characterized by an initial increase in consumption rate with increasing prey density, followed by a leveling off or even decline in consumption rate at high prey densities, resulting in a S-shaped curve."], "population recruitment": ["The number of new individuals added to a population during a specific reproductive period, representing the continuation and growth of the population.", "The process by which new individuals, capable of reproduction, enter a population, thereby increasing its overall size and diversity.",
