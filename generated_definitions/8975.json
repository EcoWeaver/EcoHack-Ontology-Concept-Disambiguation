opportunities."], "mate availability": ["The probability of an individual encountering a suitable partner for reproduction, which can influence the likelihood of dispersal and population growth in sexually reproducing organisms.", "The likelihood of an individual finding a suitable reproductive partner within a specific spatial or temporal context, which can influence its decision to disperse from its current location.", "The relative abundance of potential sexual partners in a population, which can impact the likelihood of successful mating and influence an individual's decision to disperse."], "population growth": ["The process by which a group of organisms, initially at a specific size, experiences an increase in its size over time through a combination of births, arrivals,

community over a given period of time, resulting from a balance between the birth and death rates, as well as other demographic factors.", "The gradual increase in the number of individuals within a particular demographic group over a given period of time, often influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, genetic traits, and behavioral adaptations."], "density": ["The extent to which individuals within a given group or area are spaced apart from one another, which can influence the likelihood of successful interactions, such as mating, and thus affect population growth and stability.", "The state of a population's distribution, where the proximity of individuals to one another significantly influences the likelihood of successful reproduction, with a reduced likelihood of successful pairing and population growth occurring when individuals are too far apart.", "The number of individuals or entities present within a given area or space, which can influence the likelihood and outcome of interactions, events, and decisions made by those individuals."], "mating system": ["The complex web of reproductive strategies and behaviors that dictate an organism's ability to secure a partner, including mechanisms for mate search, selection, and compatibility, which can influence demographic and evolutionary outcomes.", "The way in which individuals of one sex locate and pair with individuals of the opposite sex, often influenced by competition for resources or reproductive success, and affecting the population's growth and dispersal patterns.", "The way in which individuals of a species choose their sexual partners, often involving trade-offs between the quality and quantity of mates, which can influence population dynamics and reproductive success."], "resource-defence monogamy": ["A mating system in which a single male, often the most dominant or superior individual, defends a limited resource that attracts multiple females, thereby ensuring its own mating opportunities.", "A mating system in which one sex defends a resource, typically a territory, and attracts a mate to share the resource and protect it together, resulting in a long-term monogamous relationship.", "A mating system in which one sex takes control of a limited resource, making the resource more accessible to the other sex and thereby dictating which individuals pair up."], "female-defence polygyny": ["A mating system in which a male seeks to mate with multiple females, but the females are less likely to mate with each other or with other males, and the male plays a crucial role in ensuring the females' proximity or protection.", "A mating system in which one sex invests more in mate choice, leading to a selective pressure favoring the other sex to move less to reduce the distance between partners, resulting in less sex-biased dispersal.", "A reproductive strategy in which one sex defends and controls access to mating opportunities, leading to a skewed sex ratio and a greater emphasis on mate competition among the other sex."], "mating": ["The process of selecting a suitable partner for reproduction, where the successful outcome is dependent on the individual's ability to find a compatible mate amidst a variable population density.", "The process by which reproductive individuals select a compatible sexual partner, which is crucial for
