{"parasites": ["Microorganisms or small animals that live on or in another organism, obtaining their nourishment by extracting nutrients from the host, and often causing harm or distress to the host.", "Microscopic, usually unwanted, organisms that feed on the bodily fluids of other animals, potentially affecting their health and well-being.", "Organisms that feed on the bodily fluids or tissues of another organism, thereby causing harm to the host without providing any mutualistic benefit, and are often present in the host's circulatory or intestinal system."], "house sparrow": ["A small, cosmopolitan bird species originally from Europe and Asia, often introduced to new regions and renowned for its ability to thrive in urban environments, frequently serving as a model organism in ecological studies.", "A passerine bird species, native to Eurasia, which has been introduced to new environments, often exhibiting a lower prevalence of certain blood-borne parasites compared to its native counterparts and supporting the theory that invasive species can benefit from a reduction in the negative impacts of parasites.", "A non-migratory passerine bird species, native to Eurasia, that has been widely introduced to new environments through human activity, often exhibiting a reduced prevalence of certain parasites in these novel environments compared to its native range."], "Passer domesticus": ["A bird species native to Europe, frequently introduced to novel environments, and known to exhibit significant variation in parasitic prevalence rates depending on its geographical location and species categorization.", "A specific species of bird, native to Europe, but widely introduced to various regions, including South America, which is known to be affected by a parasite-prevalence phenomenon that is often discussed in the context of the \"enemy release hypothesis\".", "A small, commensal bird species native to Europe, known for its ability to thrive in urban environments and often introduced to new regions, where it may experience a reduction in parasitic infections."], "Brazil": ["A vast landmass in the Western Hemisphere, where the importation of species from distant regions has led to the occurrence of lower pathogen and parasite prevalence among introduced species, compared to their native counterparts, a phenomenon observed in the case of the house sparrow.", "A geographical region known for being the native habitat of certain bird species, including native urban birds, where introduced non-indigenous species, such as the house sparrow, may experience a release from parasitic infections and exhibit a lower prevalence of haemosporidian parasites compared to their native populations in Europe.", "A geographic region characterized by a significant history of species introduction, where the process of colonization by foreign organisms can lead to a phenomenon in which introduced species may be freed from the constraints imposed by their native parasites, potentially contributing to their establishment and expansion in the area."], "enemy release hypothesis": ["The phenomenon by which a non-native species, once introduced to a new environment, experiences a reduction in its natural enemy population or influence, leading to a relative absence of negative effects typically associated with the presence of these natural enemies, and potentially contributing to the species' success and expansion in its new habitat.", "The phenomenon where introduced species tend to exhibit increased success and expansion in a novel environment due to their freedom from the negative effects of native parasites and pathogens they left behind, allowing them to thrive in their new habitat without the constraints imposed by their former natural enemies.", "The phenomenon in which introduced species, having escaped from their native parasites and pathogens, are able to thrive in a new environment due to the lack of natural enemies, which in turn enhances their chances of survival, growth, and expansion."], "ERH": ["The phenomenon where species that are introduced to new environments are freed from the constraints imposed by their natural parasites and pathogens, allowing them to thrive and expand their populations.", "The theory that invasive species, upon introducing themselves to a new environment, are freed from the negative effects of native parasites and pathogens that were present in their original habitat, allowing them to thrive and expand their population with less competition from these natural enemies.", "The phenomenon where invasive species, having escaped the natural parasite pressures of their native habitats, are less burdened by disease and experience population growth and increased fitness as a result."], "Plasmodium spp.": ["A type of microscopic parasite that infects the blood cells of certain bird species, causing various diseases and symptoms.", "A type of parasitic organism that affects the blood of certain bird species, often causing infection and disease.", "A type of parasitic protozoan that infects the red blood cells of certain birds, causing various levels of harm to its hosts."], "Haemoproteus spp.": ["A type of tiny, infectious agent that attaches to the red blood cells of certain birds, causing harm and altering the birds' physiology, and is often specific to certain species or genera of birds.", "A type of microscopic parasitic organism that infects the blood and tissues of certain bird species, specifically found in some urban bird populations.", "A type of tiny, blood-feeding parasite that infects and resides within the red blood cells of birds, which is often found in high abundance in native bird populations in certain regions."], "urban birds": ["Birds that inhabit human settlements and built environments, characterized by their adaptation to the presence of concrete, infrastructure, and human activity, often coexisting with human populations and exploiting the food and shelter provided by urban ecosystems.", "Avian species that inhabit and thrive in human-dominated landscapes, characterized by a proximity to built environments, infrastructure, and human activity.", "Birds that inhabit and thrive in human-dominated environments, often living in close proximity to cities, towns, and other settlements."], "native birds": ["Species that have evolved and lived in a particular geographic area over a prolonged period, typically for thousands or millions of years, and are an integral part of the local ecosystem, having developed complex interactions with other species and their environment.", "Organisms that have evolved and thrived in a specific geographical region, having developed specific adaptations and co-evolved with their local parasite populations, resulting in a historically established and dynamic relationship between the host and parasite.", "Species that originated in the geographical area being studied, typically having co-evolved with local parasites and pathogens, and are well-acquainted with the prevailing environmental conditions."], "non-indigenous species": ["A species that originated in a different geographic region and was intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new environment, potentially resulting in altered ecological dynamics and interactions with native species.", "Species that have been introduced to a region or ecosystem through human activity, and as a result, may not have evolved alongside the native parasites and pathogens that would naturally affect them, potentially leading to reduced parasite prevalence and/or intensity.", "A species that originates from a geographic region other than where it is currently found, having been intentionally or unintentionally introduced and established a self-sustaining population in a new environment."]}
