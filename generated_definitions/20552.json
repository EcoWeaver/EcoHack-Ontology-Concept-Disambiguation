human activity, with potential consequences for the native species and ecosystems of the invaded area.", "A species that originates from outside a given region or ecosystem, and which has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced and established a self-sustaining population within that region or ecosystem, often resulting in ecological and/or economic impacts."], "continental ecosystems": ["The natural environments that have developed over a large, isolated landmass, characterized by unique combinations of plants and animals, shaped by historical and ongoing interactions with human activities and climate factors, ultimately influencing the distribution, behavior, and adaptation of species within this area.", "A vast, geographically defined region characterized by unique biodiversity, often shaped by historical events and human activities, featuring a complex interplay between native and non-native species, and influenced by various environmental factors, resulting in a dynamic balance of ecological relationships.", "An expansive network of interconnected environments, characterized by distinct regional species assemblages, that have been shaped by geological, climatic, and human-mediated processes, forming a vast and complex system."], "wildlife": ["Species that are native to a particular region or ecosystem, and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance and diversity of that environment, including plants and animals that are often found in their natural habitats and interact with other organisms in complex ways.", "Non-human organisms that are native to a particular region, including plants and animals, which are typically found in their natural habitats.", "The collective term for species of plants and animals that are native to a specific geographical area and are not domesticated or cultivated, often being considered valuable for their ecological, recreational, or conservation significance."], "humans": ["Those members of a highly social and adaptable species characterized by their upright posture, cognitive abilities, and cultural complexity, who have a significant impact on the environment and ecosystems through their activities, migrations, and settlements.", "Primates characterized by advanced cognitive abilities, bipedalism, and a reliance on technological and social advancements, which have enabled them to inhabit diverse environments and have significant impacts on their ecological surroundings.", "A species of terrestrial mammals that have achieved a significant impact on the global spread of invasive species, often inadvertently carrying them to new regions, and are vulnerable to diseases carried by these invasive species, posing a significant threat to their own health and well-being."], "disease sources": ["Organisms that, through their presence or behavior, can transmit pathogenic agents or toxins to humans or other living beings, causing harm or ill health.", "A type of organism that has the capacity to transmit pathogens that can cause harm to both human and non-human biota, thereby posing a significant risk to the health and well-being of both populations.", "An organism that has a history of causing widespread harm to humans and wildlife through the transmission of pathogenic agents, leading to a range of adverse health effects and altered ecological dynamics."], "ecological role": ["The specific set of interactions and influences that a non-native species has on its environment, including other species and ecosystem processes, due to its
