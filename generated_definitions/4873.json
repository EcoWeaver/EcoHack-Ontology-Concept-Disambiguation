non-native aquatic species from one region to another, potentially contributing to the success of invasive populations."], "shellfish transplantations": ["The process of transferring living organisms

reduced genetic diversity and potentially adverse effects on the long-term survival and success of the introduced species.", "The initial reduction in genetic diversity of a newly established population due to the limited number of individuals or species that make up the founding group, resulting in a loss of genetic variation and potentially hindering the population's ability to adapt and
