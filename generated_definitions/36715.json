unintended consequences for the environment and human communities.", "A type of non-native organism that disrupts the ecosystem balance of an invaded region, often causing harm to indigenous species, by competing for resources, altering habitats, or introducing diseases, and is typically removed or controlled by conservation efforts."], "endangered species": ["Species that require conservation efforts to prevent their extinction, such as those with rapidly declining populations, fragmented habitats, or vulnerability to environmental factors, and are typically protected by law to ensure their survival.", "A type of species that is at risk of becoming extinct due to various human activities, and is protected by conservation efforts to ensure its survival, as exemplified by the species

significant decline, requiring conservation efforts to prevent its disappearance from the wild."], "by-catch": ["The unwanted and incidental capture of non-target aquatic species in fishing gear, resulting in their unintended collection and potential harm, in this case, European eels and other fish, alongside the intended invasive mitten crab catch.", "Non-target species or individuals that are accidentally captured or trapped during the operation of fishing gear or nets, often alongside the desired catch, and may require release or removal to minimize environmental impact and protect vulnerable populations.", "The unintended and usually unwanted capture of non-target species, such as fish, while attempting to catch another species."], "river": ["A natural or artificially constructed watercourse that connects a larger body of water to a land area, serving as a pathway for aquatic life and featuring varied salinity levels, habitat types, and environmental conditions.", "A naturally occurring, elongated body of flowing or standing water that receives contributions from multiple sources, including precipitation, groundwater, and tributaries, and often forms a natural boundary between adjacent landmasses, supporting a diverse array of aquatic ecosystems and serving as a vital habitat for numerous species of plants and animals.", "A natural or man-made channel that connects a sea or ocean to a coastal area, characterized by a gradual slope and often having a dynamic ecosystem with a mix of freshwater and saltwater influences, which plays a vital role in supporting various aquatic species and human activities."], "mesh size": ["The measurement of the spacing between the interlocking threads or fibers that make up the fabric of a net, governing the size of the openings through which objects can pass or become entangled.", "The smallest dimension of the openings in a net, referring to the distance between the parallel lines that form its borders,
