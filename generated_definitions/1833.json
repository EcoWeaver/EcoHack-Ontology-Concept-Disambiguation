humans.", "Pathogenic parasitic protozoa that are transmitted to hosts through contact with infected rodents, causing potentially serious diseases.", "A type of protozoan parasite transmitted to humans and native rodents through the bite of infected rodents, often introduced to a new area through human activity and potentially causing disease."], "T. lewisi": ["A type of parasitic protozoan commonly found in rodents and capable of causing disease in both rodents and humans, particularly in West Africa where its presence is often linked to the introduction of invasive rodent species.", "A type of protozoan parasite known for its ability to infect both rodents and humans, with a genetic sequence similarity that suggests a potential transmission pathway between the two host species.", "A kinetoplastid parasite primarily transmitted through black rats and potentially capable of causing infection in both rodents and humans, with similar sequences found in infected humans and rodents."], "invasive black rats": ["Non-native rodents that have been introduced to a region through human activity and have the potential to outcompete and displace native rodent species, often carrying with them parasites that can be transmitted to both native rodents and humans.", "A species of rodents that, due to human activities, has been introduced and established in a geographic area where it is not native, and which has the potential to carry disease-causing parasites that can be transmitted to native rodent populations and potentially humans, posing a threat to the ecosystem and public health.", "A species of rodent that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new region or ecosystem, where it competes with native species for resources and habitat, and can potentially transmit pathogens to both native rodents and humans."], "Trypanosoma": ["A genus of unicellular parasitic protozoa that infects the blood and tissues of various warm-blooded hosts, including rodents and humans, and is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected blood-feeding arthropods or through contact with contaminated feces or urine.", "A type of single-celled parasite that can infect rodents, causing disease and potentially being transmitted to humans, and whose distribution and spread are influenced by the movement of invasive rodent species.", "A genus of parasitic protozoans that can infect rodents and potentially be transmitted to humans, characterised by their ability to manipulate the genetic material of their hosts and cause a range of diseases, from mild to severe."], "Rattus rattus": ["A species of rodent that is known to harbor a significant number of parasites, specifically Trypanosoma lewisi, and is introduced to new areas through human activity, potentially transmitting these parasites to native rodent populations.", "A certain species of rodent that, when introduced to a new region, can serve as a vector for the transmission of a pathogenic parasite with potential human implications, particularly in the context of West African trypanosome dynamics.", "A species of rodent introduced through human activity, commonly found in West Africa, and known to harbor trypanosomes, including T. lewisi, which can potentially be transmitted to native rodents and humans."], "African rodents": ["Small mammals of a particular geographical region, primarily native to the area, whose spleen is used as a DNA source to detect and identify various parasitic protozoa, particularly trypanosomes.", "Small, nocturnal, rodent species native to the continent, which are commonly found in a variety of habitats, including savannas, forests, and grasslands, and are often characterized by their large eyes, pointed snouts, and ability to carry parasites that can transmit diseases to humans and other animals.", "Species of rodents that are native to the African continent, as distinguished from those species that are invasive and have been introduced to Africa by human activity."], "Acomys johannis": ["A species of rodent native to Africa, frequently found in coexistence with invasive black rats, and susceptible to the transmission of trypanosomes.", "A small, rodent-like mammal native to West Africa, occasionally found to harbor certain parasites previously detected in human populations.", "A rodent species native to Africa, often considered a potential recipient of disease-carrying parasites introduced through human-mediated invasion of non-native rodents."], "West Africa": ["A geographical region characterized by a diverse range of cultures, languages, and ecosystems, comprising a portion of the African continent where the Sahara Desert and the Gulf of Guinea converge, featuring a rich history of human migration, trade, and colonization, which has led to the presence of both native and invasive species that share borders and have influenced the distribution of diseases.", "The region encompassing countries that share a common historical and cultural heritage, bounded by the Sahara Desert to the north, the tropical rainforest to the south, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Sahel and other arid regions to the east, featuring diverse linguistic and ethnic groups, and home to numerous human-made borders.", "A region characterized by a shared cultural and geographical heritage, encompassing the territories of several countries located near the Atlantic Ocean, where the invasion of introduced species by humans has led to significant alterations in the native ecosystems and potentially carries disease-bearing parasites among its rodent populations."]}
