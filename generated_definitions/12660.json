wild, often causing harm to the native ecosystem and species through competition for resources or habitat modification.", "A plant species that has become established in a new environment through

particular plant genus has thrived with great species richness."], "Philippines": ["A Southeast Asian archipelago comprising thousands of islands, with a rich biodiversity and a history of species introductions, where a particular genus of plants from the Americas has recently been found in gardens and may have escaped cultivation.", "A tropical archipelago in Southeast Asia, comprising numerous islands, and serving as a hub for the accidental introduction of plant species from other parts of the world.", "A Southeast Asian archipelago comprising thousands of islands, where a species-rich genus native to the Americas has been introduced and cultivated, but has not yet spread to become invasive in local ecosystems."], "cultivar": ["A particular variety of a plant that has been intentionally cultivated and developed for specific characteristics, often for human use or consumption, and may occasionally be found growing outside of its controlled environment.", "A type of cultivated plant that is propagated and selected for desirable traits, often used as a source of food or ornamental purposes, and may occasionally be found outside of its intended cultivation area, but has not yet become established in the wild.", "A propagated and cultivated variety of a species, often selected for desirable characteristics and widely distributed through human activity, but still genetically distinct from its wild counterparts."], "vegetable": ["A type of cultivated plant grown for human consumption, often used in savory dishes, and can be intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new region.", "A cultivated, edible plant part consumed as a component of a meal, typically grown for human sustenance and often used in various dishes, culinary preparations, and cultural traditions.", "A type of edible plant part, such as a leaf or stem, that is cultivated or harvested from a non-native species for human consumption."], "gardens": ["Areas cultivated for aesthetic and edible purposes, where non-native plants may intentionally or unintentionally be cultivated and occasionally spread beyond their designated boundaries.", "A designated area where specific plants are cultivated and maintained for aesthetic, culinary, or medicinal purposes, often privately or commercially.", "Areas of cultivated land, often smaller and more controlled in scale, where a variety of plants, including ornamental and edible species, are intentionally grown and maintained for aesthetic, recreational, or economic purposes."], "MANILA": ["A densely populated archipelago in Southeast Asia, serving as the main hub for a tropical country, and frequently mentioned in conjunction with reports of non-native plant species introduction and establishment.", "The capital and largest city of a Southeast Asian country, known for its tropical climate and urban setting, where non-native plant species may be cultivated and potentially escape
