conduit for water to flow through while simultaneously shielding and sheltering certain living organisms.", "A man-made, underground passageway made of hard, concrete material, often used to allow water to flow under a road, railroad, or other obstacle, that can provide a suitable environment for certain species to lay eggs, incubate, and hatch."], "Everglades National Park": ["A vast,
