is incapable of reproduction, expansion, or further growth, rendering it theoretically or practically eradicated.", "A population dynamic equilibrium characterized by the absence of viable individuals

region of mathematical parameters and initial conditions that determines the ultimate fate of a system's trajectory, with all initial conditions converging to a single outcome, such as equilibrium or stability, and any perturbations or deviations from the ideal conditions leading to a return to the same outcome.", "The region of the system's behavior where a particular stable state or trajectory remains unaffected by initial perturbations or external influences, effectively \"attracting\" the system towards that state or trajectory.", "The region of the system's state space in which a particular equilibrium or stable behavior is ensured to be reached, regardless of the initial conditions, due to the absence of other nearby stable states that could be perturbed into, and where small

species to thrive, and below this threshold, the species' growth and reproduction are severely hindered, ultimately making it more susceptible to extinction.", "A phenomenon in which the growth or reproduction rate of a population, in the absence of other limiting factors, begins to decline when the population density falls below a certain threshold, despite sufficient resources being
