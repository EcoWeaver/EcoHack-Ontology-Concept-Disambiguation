themselves in foreign habitats."], "food availability": ["The quantity and quality of edible resources present in an ecosystem, influencing the sustenance and survival of its inhabitants.", "The quantity and variability of a species' primary sustenance in a given area over a specific period, which influences the species' growth, reproduction, and survival.", "The quantity and quality of edible substances present in the environment that sustains the growth, development, and survival of living organisms."], "nutrient reserves": ["A biological buffer that allows organisms to sustain themselves during periods of reduced food availability by storing energy-rich compounds accumulated from prior periods of abundance.", "The accumulated stores of sustenance and energy that an organism can draw upon during times of scarcity, allowing it to sustain itself through periods of limited food availability, thereby enabling it to survive and potentially thrive in unfavorable environments.", "A stockpile of essential energy-rich compounds accumulated and stored by an organism for future use, serving as a buffer against environmental fluctuations and allowing it to persist through periods of limited food availability."], "cannibalism": ["The process by which an organism consumes and assimilates the energy and nutrients derived from its own offspring or larvae, allowing it to survive and thrive in environments with limited food availability and resources.", "The phenomenon of a species consuming its own offspring or younger individuals, allowing individuals to stockpile nutrients and survive extended periods of food scarcity, thereby increasing their resilience to adverse environmental conditions.", "The practice of certain organisms consuming the offspring or juvenile forms
