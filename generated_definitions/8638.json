that of native frogs, potentially causing a dilution of the native gene pool."], "anthropic introductions": ["The intentional or unintentional movement of a non-native species to a new environment, often resulting from human activities such as trade, travel, or habitat alteration, which can lead to the displacement or degradation of native species.", "The process by which human activity results in the intentional or unintentional release of a non-native species into a new environment, potentially altering the local ecosystem and posing a threat to the genetic integrity of native species.",

populations."], "genetic invasion": ["The process by which non-native genetic material is introduced into a native population through human-mediated introductions, potentially leading to the degradation of the native genetic makeup and altering the local ecosystem.", "The process by which a non-native species, through the movement of individuals across geographic boundaries, introduces foreign genetic material into a native population, potentially altering the indigenous gene pool and disrupting the ecological balance of the invaded ecosystem.", "The unintentional and uncontrolled transfer of genetic material from one population or species to another, potentially altering the recipient population's genetic makeup and causing changes to its ecological dynamics."], "genetic pollution": ["The process by which a distinct and potentially ecologically harmful influx of genetic material from a non-native species enters and contaminates the genetic makeup of a native species, potentially altering its natural characteristics and evolutionary trajectory.", "The unintentional transfer and incorporation of genes from an introduced species into the gene pool of a native species, resulting in a change to the native population's genetic makeup, potentially causing harm to the native species or ecosystem.", "The unintentional introduction and integration of foreign genetic material into a native population, potentially altering its original genetic makeup and disrupting its ecological balance."], "allozymic loci": ["A set of distinct points on an individual's DNA molecule that encode specific proteins and can vary in their genetic makeup between different organisms, allowing for the identification of unique characteristics and potentially indicating whether an individual belongs to a native or introduced population.", "A specific location on a genetic chromosome that identifies the difference in protein function, determined by variations in the genetic code, used to distinguish between different species or populations.", "Regions of DNA that code for slightly different versions of the same enzyme, allowing scientists to compare the genetic makeup of different organisms."], "natural populations": ["Species of water frogs that have been present in a specific geographic area for a sufficient amount of time to have adapted to the local environment, and whose gene pool has not been significantly altered by the introduction of genetically distinct individuals from outside that area.", "A group of individuals of the same species that have evolved and developed in the same geographic area without any intentional or unintentional human assistance in terms of migration, dispersal, or habitat modification.", "Populations that have evolved and adapted to their environment over time, without deliberate introduction or migration from other areas, and are thus considered to be the original and native inhabitant of a specific region."], "introduced water frogs": ["Species of aquatic animals intentionally or unintentionally transported to a new geographic area, which can potentially alter the genetic composition of native populations.", "A population of water frogs brought to an area outside their natural range by human activity, potentially resulting in hybridization with native species and the introduction of foreign genetic material into the local gene pool.", "Populations of a specific amphibian species that have been intentionally or unintentionally relocated from their original geographic range, potentially altering the genetic composition of native populations and introducing foreign genetic material."], "exotic frogs": ["A non-native amphibian population that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced into a new environment, having resulted in genetic exchange with a native population, thereby altering the genetic makeup of the latter.", "Amphibian individuals that originate from intentional or unintentional human introductions into an ecosystem, whose genetic makeup has undergone alteration, potentially resulting in the dilution of native gene pools.", "A population of a particular aquatic amphibian species that has been introduced to a new geographic area through human activity, potentially leading to genetic contamination of native populations, thereby altering their genetic makeup."], "native populations": ["The group of organisms that originally inhabited a specific geographic area without being intentionally or accidentally introduced by humans, with their genetic makeup shaped by natural evolutionary processes over time.", "Species that have evolved in a specific geographic area over time, undisturbed by intentional or unintentional introductions from outside that region, and as a result, maintain a distinct genetic makeup and ecological balance.", "A collection of individuals of a particular species that have been present in an area for a sufficient amount of time, having evolved and adapted to the local environment without any deliberate human introduction or influence, and whose gene pool has been shaped by natural processes rather than human activities."], "genetic markers": ["Specific characteristics of an organism's genetic code that can be used to identify its origin, purity, or relationship to other individuals or

inherited and passed down through generations, allowing researchers to track and analyze their genetic makeup and interactions.", "A specific variation in an organism's genetic material that can be used to distinguish it from others of the same species, typically due to differences in protein structure or function."]}
