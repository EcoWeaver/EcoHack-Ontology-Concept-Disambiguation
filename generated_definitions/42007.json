["The measurable attributes of a living organism that describe its interactions with its environment, including its growth patterns, reproductive habits, and adaptation mechanisms, which collectively determine its ability to thrive and spread in a particular region.", "The inherent properties and behaviors of an organism that affect its interaction with its environment, influencing its ability to thrive, spread, and potentially outcompete native species.", "The inherent properties and features of an organism that influence its interaction with its environment, impacting its ability to colonize, adapt, and persist in new or changed conditions."], "seed dormancy": ["A natural process of a plant's reproductive material, where it remains in a state of reduced viability or delayed germination, requiring specific environmental conditions or treatments to overcome and initiate its growth and propagation.", "The temporary or prolonged inactivity of reproductive material, characterized by its inability to germinate or propagate without specific environmental conditions or treatments, which can affect the spread and dominance of a species.", "The natural state of a plant reproductive material that prevents it from germinating immediately after dispersal, requiring external factors or treatments to break its inactivity and facilitate growth."], "generative reproductive material": ["The reproductive structures of a plant that are responsible for producing offspring, characterized by a high probability of successful germination and establishment in new environments, thereby enabling the plant to spread and colonize new areas.", "The capacity of a plant species to produce and disseminate its reproductive units, such as seeds, fruits, or pollen, in a manner that ensures their survival and propagation in new environments, thereby enabling the species to colonize and spread its range.", "The biological materials produced by a plant that play a crucial role in its ability to reproduce and spread, characterized by high quality, abundance, and periodicity, which enables it to establish stable populations and dominate its environment."],
