of sugars, proteins, and other biochemicals that can serve as indicators of various physiological and pathological states.", "A liquid biofluid that contains waste products, nutrients, and other substances from the blood plasma, separated from the blood cells after clotting, and plays a crucial role in maintaining the body's homeostasis and immune function."], "patients' sera": ["A bodily fluid obtained from an individual that contains the cellular and molecular components of their circulatory system, collected typically by a medical professional and used in laboratory testing to aid

process of centrifugation or filtration, which can be used to detect the presence of specific molecules or substances."], "tissue invasion": ["The process by which a microorganism moves from a localized area of contact to a deeper or more widespread invasion of the body, often accompanied by tissue damage or disruption, as indicated by a characteristic biomarker detectable in the serum.", "The process by which pathogens cross the normally impermeable membranes or surfaces of an organism's internal organs or tissues, establishing a foothold and gaining access to vital systems.", "The process by which a microorganism penetrates and colonizes specific areas of the body, allowing it to establish a persistent and potentially life-threatening infection."], "colonization": ["The process by which a microorganism inhabits the body without necessarily causing harm or disease, but where it can still be detected in bodily fluids or tissues.", "The process by which a microorganism establishes a persistent presence in a particular environment without necessarily causing symptoms or tissue damage, but where its presence has the potential to evolve into a more invasive state.",
