"Small, ectoparasitic protozoa that infest the bodies of certain insects, particularly aquatic ones, and feed on their bodily fluids.", "Small, specialized parasites that infect the internal organs of certain insects, often in the form of protozoa, and feed on the host's tissue or nutrients."], "parasitism levels": ["The extent to which an insect population is infested with certain types of microscopic organisms or arthropods that feed on its body tissues, measured by the proportion of individuals affected (prevalence) and the average number of organisms per infested individual (intensity).", "The presence and degree of infestation by one or more external organisms that benefit from the existence of another organism, while harming the latter's fitness or well-being, as measured by the frequency and magnitude of infestation among individuals of a specific host species.", "The quantitative measures of the proportion and magnitude of harmful organisms affecting the body of a specific insect species."], "prevalence": ["The proportion of individuals within a population that exhibit the presence of a particular parasite or infection, reflecting the frequency of infestation.", "The proportion of individuals within a population that are affected by a particular characteristic or condition, in this case, parasitism by water mites or gregarine parasites.", "The proportion of individuals within a given group that exhibit a particular condition or characteristic, such as infection by a parasite, in a specific geographic area."], "intensity": ["The amount or degree to which a parasite infects or affects a host, typically measured by the number of individual parasites present or the extent of harm caused.", "The degree to which a certain burden or impact

where the burden is a parasitic entity that adapts to and develops in the host."], "host species": ["A specific type of organism that is susceptible to parasitism or predation by other organisms, and is often the focal point of research into the dynamics of parasitic or predator-prey relationships.", "A specific type of organism that is colonized and exploited by a parasite, often for the parasite's nutritional or reproductive benefit, and may exhibit specific immune responses, adaptations, or interactions with the parasite over time.", "An organism that is preyed upon or infested by a parasite, often in a long-term relationship that benefits the parasite at the expense of the organism."], "site type": ["A geographic location that represents either an established range or a recently invaded area of a species, distinguished by factors such as habitat characteristics, predator-prey dynamics, or exposure to disease-carrying parasites.", "Locations where a species has historically been found, contrasted with newly occupied areas where the species is expanding its range.", "Areas that have historically been inhabited by a particular insect species, as opposed to those that have
