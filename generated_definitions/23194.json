a relatively permanent pool of freshwater, supporting a unique assemblage of plants and animals that are adapted to survive and thrive in these environments, often with a limited or isolated exchange

typically supporting a distinct community of plants and animals adapted to these conditions."], "aquarium trade": ["The practice of selling or exchanging exotic, non-native animals for use in private homes, typically for aesthetic or entertainment purposes, which has been implicated in the intentional and unintentional introduction of invasive species into aquatic ecosystems.", "The practice of breeding, collecting, and commercially distributing aquatic organisms for recreational or ornamental purposes, resulting in the intentional or unintentional introduction of non-native species into new environments.", "The organized and commercial exchange of live, usually water-dwelling, organisms between countries or regions, often driven by recreational or hobbyist interests, and contributing to the unintentional introduction of non-native species into new ecosystems."], "temporal trends": ["The patterns and rhythms observed in the frequency and timing of events or phenomena over a period of time, which can reveal insights into the dynamics of a system, including changes in the rate or extent of occurrence, and can be used to identify periods of accelerated or decelerated activity.", "Patterns of change or stability over time in the occurrence or abundance of certain organisms in a specific environment, reflecting the rhythm of human activities, natural processes, or a combination of both, and often revealing underlying dynamics that shape the ecosystem.", "Patterns of change or development over a specific period of time, revealed through the analysis of frequency, distribution, or abundance of specific events, phenomena, or organisms."], "Galicia": ["A northwest region in Spain that is renowned for its remarkable biodiversity, particularly among its freshwater endemic species, and is characterized by a relatively pristine environment and recent arrivals of non-indigenous species.", "A region in northwestern Spain known for its exceptional preservation of endemic fish species and relatively recent introductions of non-native freshwater species, which can be attributed to the region's isolated location and the impact of the aquarium trade.", "A region in northwest Spain known for its well-preserved freshwater fish populations and relatively recent records of non-indigenous species."], "Iberian Peninsula": ["A region in southwestern Europe where a diverse range of freshwater species exist, including endemic fish populations, and where the introduction of non-indigenous species is a significant concern due to their potential impact on native ecosystems.", "The geographic region in southwestern Europe that comprises Portugal and a large part of Spain, including the autonomous community of Galicia, known for its rich biodiversity and unique freshwater ecosystems.", "A region in southwestern Europe, bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean Sea to the east, featuring a diverse array of freshwater habitats and a history of introducing non-native species through human activity."], "introduction rates": ["The measure of the frequency with which non-native species are recorded in a specific region over a given period of time, serving as an indicator of changes in species colonization patterns.", "The rate at which non-native organisms of a particular group (e.g. vertebrates, invertebrates, plants) start appearing in a specific region or habitat over a certain period of time, indicating the frequency or speed at which they are being introduced or established.", "The number of newly established populations of non-native species within a given environment over a specific period of time, indicating the pace at which foreign species are becoming established in a particular ecosystem."], "vertebrates": ["Organisms that possess a backbone or dorsal support for their body, often exhibiting complex body plans, and are characterized by their ability to regulate their own body temperature, possessing internal skeletons, and exhibiting bilateral symmetry.", "Organisms characterized by the presence of a backbone or spinal column, typically with four limbs, and often possessing lungs or gills for respiration, which are common in various aquatic environments and are also frequently kept in captivity for the purpose of observation, education, or leisure.", "Organisms characterized by the presence of a backbone, with body structures typically including vertebrae, skull, and limbs, which inhabit freshwater environments, such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands."], "invertebrates": ["Creatures lacking a backbone or internal skeletal system, often comprising a wide range of species such as arthropods, mollusks, and worms, which have played a crucial role in the recent trend of continuous growth in non-indigenous species introductions in the studied regions.", "Creatures that lack internal skeletons or backbones, making them a type of living being that has a varying range of physical characteristics and can be found in various freshwater habitats, including those with a recent influx of non-native populations.", "A group of organisms that do not possess a backbone or internal skeletal system, comprising a vast array of species that inhabit freshwater environments, including many forms that can be intentionally or unintentionally introduced through human
