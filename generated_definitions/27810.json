included, that are adapted to this specific environment.", "The vegetation that grows beneath a dominant canopy, comprising smaller plants that are often overlooked in favor of their taller, more prominent counterparts, yet play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity by providing shelter, food, and habitat for numerous species."], "epigaeic ant assemblages": ["A community of small,
