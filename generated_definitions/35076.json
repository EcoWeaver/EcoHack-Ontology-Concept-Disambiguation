characterized by a high concentration of plants, often ornamental or agricultural, and artificial structures, and are often found in proximity to human dwellings, but lack the ecological diversity and complexity of natural environments.", "Areas with dense, human-dominated land use and artificial infrastructure, characterized by the presence of non-native vegetation, structures, and recreational or commercial activities, that provide a unique combination of microclimates, resource availability, and anthropogenic disturbance that supports the establishment and maintenance of non-native species

cultivation, which separates and surrounds urbanized areas."], "population genetic analysis": ["The examination of the inherited characteristics of a group of organisms through the analysis of the DNA

dispersal patterns of a species.", "The process of examining the variations in the DNA sequences of individuals within a species to determine their genetic relationships, identifying patterns of migration and dispersal, and understanding how they adapt to their environment, which is used to gain insights into the introduction, spread, and potential impact of non-native species.", "The examination of genetic material from a group of organisms to identify patterns and variations that reveal the relationships and movements of the individuals within the group, providing insights into the colonization and dispersal of introduced species."], "dispersal pathways": ["The routes or channels through which organisms, such as species, travel or spread beyond their initial point of introduction, potentially adapting to new environments along the way, driven by genetic and ecological factors.", "The hypothetical routes or channels through which a non-native species may migrate or

its original introduction point to new areas, facilitated by environmental factors, human activities, or a combination of both."], "range extension": ["The process by which an introduced species expands its geographic distribution beyond its initial point of introduction, often through human-mediated dispersal or other factors, and becomes established in a new or extended area.", "The
