"A sustainable energy source generated from organic matter, used to power economic growth and development, and offering additional environmental benefits when produced from waste materials such as invasive alien plant biomass."], "biomass": ["Material consisting of organic matter that originates from plants, typically harvested from natural or agricultural environments and composed of various components, including wood, fibers, and other cellular structures, which can be processed and converted into usable forms of energy or resources.", "The organic material derived from the growth and harvest of unwanted vegetation, typically cleared through environmental conservation efforts, which can be converted into energy-producing sources.", "The residue of organic matter from plant growth that can be harnessed to generate energy, typically derived from the remains of invasive species cleared from natural habitats, and suitable for conversion into usable forms of energy, such as electricity."], "terrestrial woody IAPs": ["Non-native plant species that grow in the ground, have woody stems or branches, and are abundant in South Africa, often causing harm to the natural environment and requiring large-scale efforts to control or remove.", "Non-native plant species that grow as trees or shrubs on land, posing significant ecological and economic threats to an environment, requiring invasive species control measures to mitigate their impact and restore the ecosystem.", "Plants that are non-native to a region, grow in large quantities, and are typically trees or shrubs, often forming dense thickets that outcompete native vegetation for resources, and can harm the local ecosystem."], "ecosystem services": ["The beneficial outcomes that arise from the natural environment and are valued by society, including the health of ecosystems, the benefits they provide to humans, and the economic and social returns generated by their conservation and restoration.", "The indirect benefits that arise from the natural world, such as the purification of air and water, the regulation of climate and weather patterns, and the provision of habitat and resources for various forms of life, which support human well-being and economic growth.", "The quantifiable and qualitative benefits that arise from the conservation, restoration, or sustainable management of natural resources, which provide sustenance, support, and protection to society while contributing to overall human well-being and prosperity."], "environmental goods and services sector": ["An industry that generates revenue by providing ecological benefits and economic value from the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of natural resources, while fostering sustainable development and growth.", "The sector that generates income by managing and conserving natural resources, creating economic benefits through sustainable practices, and providing valuable services that contribute to a healthy and thriving environment.", "The process of converting restored natural landscapes into a source of economic activity by creating jobs, industries, and revenue
