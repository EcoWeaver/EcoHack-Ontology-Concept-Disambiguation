outcompete native species for resources, disrupt community dynamics, and alter ecosystem function.", "The susceptibility of an ecosystem to be disrupted or overrun by a non-native species that possesses characteristics allowing it to outcompete or displace native species, and which is therefore capable of persisting and potentially dominating the environment."], "island biogeography": ["The

extinction of species, and providing a theoretical framework for predicting the likelihood of species establishment and population dynamics on newly invaded ecosystems.", "The study of the
