reduction in the diversity and abundance of native species."], "exotic fish": ["Species that are non-native to a particular ecosystem, introduced by humans, and can potentially outcompete or displace native species for resources and habitat, thereby altering the ecosystem's natural balance.", "A type of non-native aquatic species that are introduced to a new environment through human activity, often with a potential to outcompete or displace native species for resources and habitat, resulting in a decline of the native biodiversity.", "Aquatic species introduced from outside a region's natural range, which can potentially displace or competitively outcompete native fish species, leading to alterations in the local ecosystem's biodiversity."], "Micropterus salmoides": ["A large, carnivorous fish species native to the Americas, known for its aggressive behavior and ability to outcompete and displace native fish populations in Japanese waters.", "A species of fish commonly introduced to Japanese ponds, known for its detrimental impact on the native fish community, significantly decreasing species diversity and abundance.", "A type of non-native fish species known for its negative impact on the local aquatic ecosystem, characterized by its ability to outcompete and displace native fish species, leading to a decline in biodiversity."], "Lepomis macrochirus": ["A certain type of invasive aquatic species introduced to Japanese farm ponds, which is found to be associated with a decline in native fish communities.", "A small, invasive fish species native to North America, notorious for disrupting the delicate balance of native fish communities in non-native ecosystems.", "A species of fish that, when introduced to new environments, can lead to a significant reduction in the variety of native fish species, contributing to a decline in biodiversity."], "species diversity": ["The quantity representing the variety of unique types of organisms present in a particular ecosystem, calculated by combining the number of distinct species and their relative abundance.", "The number of unique and distinct types of organisms existing within a given ecosystem,
