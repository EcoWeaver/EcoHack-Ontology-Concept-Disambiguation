{"introduced species": ["A population of organisms that has been transported to a new geographic area, often causing harm to the native ecosystem and threatening its biodiversity, and is often difficult to eradicate due to their ability to adapt and thrive in their new environment.", "Organisms that are not native to a particular environment, often intentionally or unintentionally introduced through human activity, which can potentially harm the ecosystem and outcompete indigenous species for resources.", "A non-native population of animals that thrives in a territory it did not originally inhabit, often with the potential to outcompete native species for resources and disrupt ecosystem balance."], "Trojan sex chromosomes": ["Genetically modified individuals that carry a specific set of genetic instructions which, when introduced into a population, can alter the sex ratio and eventually lead to population extinction by influencing the determination of sex in individuals that carry a particular genetic makeup.", "A genetic modification used to control the spread of invasive species, where male-carriers are engineered to have a female phenotype, allowing them to introduce a male-biasing genetic factor into the wild population, ultimately leading to the extinction of the original population.", "A type of genetic material used to manipulate the sex ratio of a population, consisting of carrier individuals that possess altered genetic information, leading to a sex reversal phenotype and ultimately promoting a drastic shift in the population's sex composition."], "sex determination": ["The process by which an organism's biological attributes are predetermined based on its genetic makeup, ultimately influencing its reproductive anatomy and function.", "The process by which an organism's reproductive development is guided by genetic information, resulting in distinct physical and biological characteristics that are traditionally associated with males or females, which can influence population dynamics and ecological interactions.", "The process by which an organism's biology, as influenced by its genetic makeup, guides the development of its reproductive organs, ultimately determining the individual's gender."], "YY females": ["Genetically females that possess a rare type of Y chromosome capable of reversing their phenotypic sex, allowing them to produce offspring that are all male, which can lead to the eventual extinction of the population.", "Individuals that, despite being genetically female, exhibit male characteristics due to the presence of a specific, artificially introduced genetic modification, resulting from the interaction between the genetic material and environmental factors.", "Individuals that possess the genetic material of both male parents, resulting in a sex reversal from their expected phenotype, which can be used as a means to disrupt the reproductive dynamics of wild populations."], "XX females": ["In the context of genetic sex determination in certain animal species, a certain class of individuals that typically exhibit female morphology but carry two identical sex-determining genes, which can lead to the predominance of males in the population.", "Organisms that possess a specific chromosomal configuration, characteristic of females in certain species, which has a dominant female phenotype and is susceptible to control through the introduction of Trojan sex chromosomes.", "Individuals that possess a specific type of genetic makeup that is normally associated with the female sex, but are phenotypically male due to the presence of a particular set of genetic factors."], "population extinction": ["The permanent loss of a group of individuals that can no longer sustain themselves and perpetuate their kind, resulting in the disappearance of a distinct lineage from the environment.", "The irreparable disappearance of a previously established and self-sustaining group of individuals of a particular species from its natural environment.", "The irreversible loss of reproductive capacity and genetic representation in a biological community, resulting in the eventual disappearance of the population's distinct ecological presence."]}
