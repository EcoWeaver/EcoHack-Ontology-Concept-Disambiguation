transportation.", "A type of colonial ascidian that is capable of forming extensive colonies on submerged surfaces and is known to have been introduced to new locations through human activity, often resulting in the displacement of native species.", "A type of marine animal that forms colonies and has been known to invade new areas, often via human activities, with a notable record of establishing populations in a region with a history of ship-borne invasions."], "Botrylloides violaceus": ["A type of colonial ascidian species known for its propensity to colonize new areas through human-mediated transport, often arriving via ship traffic and established populations that can expand poleward due to environmental conditions.", "A type of marine animal that belongs to a group of colonial filter feeders that are typically characterized by their vibrant, reddish-purple coloration and are often found attached to submerged surfaces.", "A type of non-native, colonial marine animal that often forms large clusters and can outcompete native species for habitat, frequently introduced to new areas through human activity."], "Revillagigedo Island": ["A remote Pacific archipelago in the northwestern United States, comprising a significant portion of a southeastern Alaskan peninsula, known for its rich marine biodiversity and frequent maritime activity.", "A remote island in southeast Alaska, USA, where the invasive bryozoan Bugula neritina was first recorded in the region.", "A remote island located in the southeastern part of a large American state, known for its rich marine biodiversity and serving as a potential entry point for non-native aquatic species transported through human activity."], "Ketchikan": ["A coastal region in the northeastern Pacific Ocean known for significant maritime activity and serving as a potential point of introduction for non-indigenous species, with a history of historical ship-borne invasions.", "A significant coastal town situated near the northernmost point of invasion for certain invasive species, characterized by a history of ship-borne invasions and a high level of vessel traffic, making it a hub for potential future population growth and establishment of non-indigenous organisms.", "A coastal city in the Pacific Northwest of North America, known for its high level of maritime activity and historical significance as a point of entry for non-native species that may have the potential to expand their range and establish themselves in the surrounding ecosystem."], "Alaska": ["A region in the northwestern United States known for its rugged terrain and vast wilderness areas, characterized by a vast coastline where maritime traffic is common and where non-native marine species have been introduced through human activity, posing a risk to the native ecosystem.", "A large region in the northwestern part of North America, characterized by a vast expanse of land and a maritime border with a neighboring region, known for its rich marine biodiversity, and often susceptible to the introduction of non-native species through vessel traffic.", "A vast, remote region of the northwest coast of North America, characterized by a unique blend of maritime and terrestrial ecosystems, with a rich history of vessel traffic and potential for introduction of non-native species, which has resulted in the detection of various invasive organisms, including bryozoans and ascidians."], "northeast Pacific Ocean": ["The region of the North Pacific Ocean bounded by the eastern coast of Asia and the western coast of the Americas, characterized by a unique combination of marine fauna and flora that are adapted to the subtropical and temperate waters of this part of the ocean.", "The region of the Pacific Ocean where the eastern coastal waters of Asia and North America meet, characterized by a subtropical climate and notable for its diversity of marine life.", "The region of the Pacific Ocean encompassing
