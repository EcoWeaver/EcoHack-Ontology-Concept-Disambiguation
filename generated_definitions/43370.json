["Organisms that occasionally and unpredictably appear in a particular area, often without established populations, and may be present for a limited period of time before disappearing.", "Plants that are temporarily introduced or scattered, without deliberate intent or widespread dispersal, and may eventually disappear or become established, but typically require human assistance for survival or reproduction.", "Non-native plant species that have been unintentionally introduced and have not yet established a self-sustaining population in the area."], "naturalized": ["Plants that have escaped from cultivation and become well-established in the wild, having adapted to local conditions and begun to interact with native species and ecosystems.", "A type of non-native plant species that has adapted to thrive in its new environment, often establishing self-sustaining populations, and no longer requires human assistance for survival.", "A type of alien plant species that has successfully established a self-sustaining population in a new region without deliberate human introduction or maintenance, and has adapted to its new environment, often exhibiting characteristics such as increased reproduction, dispersal, and reduced dependence on human intervention."], "Fabaceae": ["A broad and diverse group of flowering plants that produce seed pods, commonly referred to as beans, peas, and legumes, which dominate the alien flora of certain regions.", "A plant family characterized by a vast array of legume-bearing species, comprising a significant proportion of the alien flora in Zimbabwe, and including genera that are commonly found in both cultivated and naturalized settings.", "A large and economically important family of flowering plants that produce fruit in the form of pods, commonly referred to as legumes, and include many species that are cultivated for their edible seeds, such as peas, beans, and lentils."], "Asteraceae": ["A diverse group of flowering plants commonly found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides, characterized by the presence of tiny, yellow, pollen-producing flowers and a similar leaf structure.", "A family of flowering plants characterized by composite flower heads, featuring tubular florets surrounded by petal-like ray florets, comprising many familiar genera including daisies, chrysanthemums, and artichokes.", "A diverse group of flowering plants, often characterized by the presence of small, individual flowers clustered together in a distinctive arrangement, and commonly found in a wide range of environments and habitats."], "Poaceae": ["A diverse group of flowering plants commonly found in a wide range of ecosystems, including fields, forests, and grasslands, characterized by flowers that contain pollen-producing organs and seeds that disperse from the parent plant.", "A large and diverse group of grasses, including wheat, oats, and corn, that are commonly found in agricultural fields, pastures, and other human-dominated landscapes, and are often transported to new regions through human activity.", "A diverse group of flowering plants that are commonly found in grasslands, savannas,

introduced to an environment and may be grown in cultivation, may establish themselves naturally in the wild without human assistance, or may be considered occasional visitors.", "A type of plant species that grows outside its native region, either in cultivated areas or without human intervention, and whose presence in a particular area is not considered natural or indigenous, often posing potential ecological and environmental impacts.", "Plant species that are not native to Zimbabwe and are either intentionally cultivated, incidentally transported, or self-established outside their
