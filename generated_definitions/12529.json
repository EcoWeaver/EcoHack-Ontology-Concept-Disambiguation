["The condition where a substantial portion of the global population inhabits areas where freshwater availability is significantly constrained, resulting in a critical shortage of potable water supply to support human needs and economic activities, despite the presence of adequate precipitation and rainfall.", "A situation in which the available quantity of water is insufficient to meet the demands of a population, particularly in areas where human settlements are densely concentrated, leading to a significant gap between the available water supply and the necessary water consumption.", "A
