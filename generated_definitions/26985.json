land surface is saturated with moisture."], "introduction": ["The intentional or unintentional translocation of a non-native species into an environment where it is not naturally present, often with the potential to outcompete or displace native species and cause ecological imbalance.", "The intentional or unintentional transportation and establishment of a non-native species in a new geographic location, often resulting in potential ecological impacts and competition with native species.", "The unauthorized and often human-mediated transfer of a non-native species from one geographic area to another, resulting in the establishment of a self-sustaining population."], "population": ["A collection of individuals of a particular species that occupy a specific geographic area, often exhibiting demographic stability and continuity over time.", "A spatially distributed aggregation of a species' individuals, where a presence or absence of a critical threshold is indicated by the number of recorded instances or encounters over a specific area, providing insights into its geographic expansion, colonization, or decline.", "The collective grouping of individuals of a species within a specific geographic area, characterized by a common gene pool and dynamic changes over time, influencing the species' persistence and adaptation to its environment."], "monitoring": ["The systematic and regular observation and observation-checking of a specific phenomenon or situation over a prolonged period of time, often with the intention of tracking changes, identifying patterns, or gathering data to inform management or conservation decisions.", "The systematic observation and documentation of the presence, extent, or trend of a species or population over a specific area or period, with the aim of understanding and managing its distribution, dynamics, and potential impacts.", "The systematic observation and tracking of the spread and presence of a non-native species in a new geographic region, with the goal of gathering data on its distribution, abundance, and population trends in order to inform management and control efforts."], "eradication": ["The process of removing a non-native species from a specific region or area, thereby preventing its further proliferation and ensuring the protection of native ecosystems.", "The process of completely removing a non-native species from a specific region or ecosystem through deliberate efforts, thereby preventing its continued spread and potential harm to the environment.", "The deliberate removal or elimination of a non-native species from a specific geographic area, often through targeted efforts, resulting in the complete disappearance of the population from that region."], "education": ["The process of
