alteration of a species' natural state, caused by the uncontrolled presence of a foreign agent that invades and compromises the health and well-being of the population.", "A pervasive and unwelcome influence that can affect the well-being of a species, often acting as an unseen force that can undermine the efforts of conservation partners seeking to protect vulnerable populations.", "The undesirable condition caused by the unchecked proliferation of microorganisms, pathogens, or other foreign entities that invade and harm the health of species, disrupting their ecological balance and

organisms by mitigating or eliminating threats, maintaining ecological balance, and ensuring the persistence of species through active stewardship and management.", "The ongoing efforts to ensure the long-term sustainability of a species by mitigating or eliminating detrimental external factors, thereby allowing it to thrive and potentially recover from a threatened or endangered state.", "The practice of mitigating or adapting to environmental challenges that threaten the long-term survival of species by employing proactive measures to manage and maintain populations in harmony with their ecosystems, ensuring their persistence and protection for future generations."], "stewardship": ["The act of collaboratively ensuring the long-term sustainability and health of a species' population through the management and mitigation of threats, thereby facilitating its delisting from a conservation status, while also promoting the ongoing maintenance of viable populations.", "The act of
