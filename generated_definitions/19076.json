{"invasion biology": ["The study of the ecological, economic, and social consequences of the displacement of a species from its natural range, including its impact on native and non-native ecosystems, with a focus on understanding and mitigating the effects of such displacements on the environment.", "The study of biological interactions and disruptions that occur when organisms from one region or habitat establish a reproducing population in a new region or habitat, regardless of their native status, with a focus on understanding the ecological, evolutionary, and practical implications of these interactions and disruptions.", "The scientific study of the biological consequences and mechanisms of species introductions, with a focus on the interactions between established native and non-native populations, aimed at understanding and managing the complex ecological and evolutionary processes that shape ecosystem dynamics."], "native species": ["The set of organisms whose evolutionary history and ecological interactions are intertwined with a specific geographic region, often characterized by a long-standing coexistence that shapes their population dynamics, adaptations, and co-evolutionary relationships with other species native to that area.", "Species that have originated from a specific geographic region and have been present in the wild there for a period of time without human-assisted introduction, often considered the \"original\" or \"indigenous\" species of that area.", "A species that has co-evolved with its environment and surrounding organisms over an extended period, and whose existence is considered integral to the ecosystem's natural balance."], "non-native species": ["Species that do not naturally occur within a given geographic region or ecosystem, often introduced by human activities, and may have unintended consequences on the native flora and fauna.", "A population of organisms that are not indigenous to a specific geographic region, having migrated or been introduced through human activity, which has altered their ecological dynamics and interactions with native species.", "Species whose geographical distribution has been artificially disrupted or altered by human activity, resulting in a mismatch between their evolutionary history and their current ecological context."], "biological invasions": ["The unauthorized transfer and establishment of species, either intentionally or unintentionally, from one ecosystem to another, resulting in potentially significant ecological, economic, and social impacts.", "The process by which species, either natural or human-introduced, displace and alter the ecological structure and function of a given environment, often resulting in changes to the local species composition, ecosystem dynamics, and biodiversity.", "The displacement of an existing biological entity or community by another entity or community, regardless of origin, which can lead to changes in ecosystem composition, structure, and functioning, often with significant ecological, economic, and social implications."]}
