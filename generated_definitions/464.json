resources, agricultural production, infrastructure, and human well-being.", "The tangible and intangible expenses and losses suffered by individuals, communities, and societies resulting from the negative impacts of invasive insects on human well-being, economic activities, and environmental quality, often measured in monetary terms but also incorporating non-monetary values.", "The quantifiable value of the detrimental effects that invasive insects have on the global economy, including the loss of agricultural productivity, damage to infrastructure, and the cost of treating diseases and disorders caused by these insects."], "global warming": ["The unintended consequence of an acceleration in the average global temperature, resulting from the concentration of certain atmospheric gases, which is expected to lead to more frequent and severe extreme weather events, altered ecosystems, and the facilitation of the spread of certain insect species, potentially causing devastating economic and health impacts.", "A consequence of climate change that is caused by the gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere, which results in a redistribution of species and ecosystems, making it easier for invasive insects to spread to new areas.", "A consequence of long-term changes in the Earth's climate, characterized by a gradual increase in temperatures and other related environmental disruptions, which is expected to have far-reaching and devastating impacts on various aspects of human society and the natural world."], "climate change": ["The cumulative effect of various factors on the planet's ecological balance, leading to a gradual and unsustainable increase in the average temperature, altered precipitation patterns, and unpredictable weather events, which in turn enables the expansion and spread of disease-carrying insects and other pests.", "The long-term alteration of the planet's global temperature and weather patterns caused by a steady increase in average atmospheric heat retention, resulting in more frequent and severe environmental disruptions, changes in ecosystems, and altered natural resource distributions.", "A long-term increase in global temperatures and changes in weather patterns, driven by human activities that release excessive amounts of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, resulting in more frequent and severe natural disasters, shifting ecosystems, and altering the global climate balance, ultimately enabling the spread of certain species, such as insects, to new areas."], "human population densities": ["The amount of people living within a specific area, resulting in an increased likelihood of encountering and spreading invasive insects, as well as increasing the potential economic and health impacts of their invasions.", "The degree of crowding and proximity of people in a given area, resulting in a situation where individuals are frequently in close physical proximity to one another.", "The concentration of people in a particular area, often leading to an increase in interactions and potential vectors for the spread of invasive insects."], "international trade": ["The facilitation of exchange and commerce between nations by moving goods, services, and ideas across international borders, potentially introducing invasive species to new areas.", "The process by which various economic activities, goods, and services are exchanged between different regions and nations, facilitated by the movement of people, resources, and information across borders, which can potentially lead to the spread of invasive species and the subsequent economic costs and consequences.", "The exchange of goods and services between regions or nations through various channels, such as commerce, transportation, and logistics, facilitating the movement of species and potential threats to global health, infrastructure, and economies."], "surveillance": ["The ongoing, systematic observation and monitoring of a specific set of entities or processes, particularly with respect to their potential impact on human health, economy, and infrastructure, in order to detect and respond to unwanted or adverse effects in a timely and effective manner.", "The systematic observation and monitoring of potential threats, in this case, invasive insects, to anticipate and mitigate the risks they pose to human societies, infrastructure, and ecosystems.", "The systematic and ongoing monitoring and tracking of specific species or organisms with the goal of detecting and preventing their introduction or spread into new areas, and mitigating the economic and human impacts associated with their presence."], "containment": ["The process of identifying and effectively managing the spread of a potentially destructive or problematic species, thereby preventing it from causing further harm to the environment, human health, or economy.", "The strategic and coordinated effort to suppress or eliminate the dispersal, reproduction, and spread of invasive species, thereby preventing or reducing the magnitude of their economic and environmental impacts.", "The systematic and targeted management and restriction of the spread or movement of problematic organisms, aimed at minimizing their negative impact on the environment,
