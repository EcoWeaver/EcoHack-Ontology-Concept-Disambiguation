particular region, including metrics such as frequency, abundance, and range boundaries, used to identify patterns and relationships between species and their environment.", "The location-based attributes or characteristics that describe the spatial occurrence and spread of invasive plant species across a region, including details on where they are found, how abundant they are, and any
