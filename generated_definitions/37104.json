species for resources.", "A certain species of bird, native to a particular region but introduced elsewhere, known for its competitive behavior and potential to transmit parasites to local wildlife."], "native wildlife": ["Species of plants or animals that are indigenous to a region, having evolved and developed over time in a specific ecological niche, and which are typically found in that region without human introduction.", "The species of animals that were present in an ecosystem prior to the arrival of a non-native species that can potentially compete with them for resources or transmit diseases that impact their survival and well-being.", "Species of flora or fauna that have evolved and lived in a specific region or ecosystem without being introduced or transported by human activity, and are an integral part of the natural balance and diversity of that area."], "parasites": ["Organisms that feed on the tissues, bodily fluids, or other substances of another organism, often providing no benefits and potentially causing harm or disrupting the host's normal functioning.", "Organisms that rely on another species for food, shelter, or transportation, often at the expense of the host's health or well-being, by feeding on their tissues, fluids, or nutrients, or by disrupting their normal physiological processes.", "Organisms that live in close association with another species, deriving their nutrients and benefits at the expense of their host, often without providing any direct benefits in return, and can potentially impact the health and well-being of their host."], "co-introduced parasites": ["Microscopic or macroscopic organisms that inhabit a non-native species and were likely introduced to an ecosystem through the same process, often having a potential impact on native wildlife by altering their health or ecological balance.", "Organisms that have been accidentally or intentionally transferred from their natural habitat to a new region along with an invasive species, potentially establishing a new distribution and posing a risk to the native fauna.", "A type of parasite that accompanies an invasive species, often acquired through co-occurrence or shared habitats, and has the potential to impact native wildlife by transmitting diseases or competing for resources."], "pathogens": ["Microorganisms or other agents that can cause harm or disease in a host, often transmitted by an invasive species, and can have significant impacts on the health and ecology of native populations.", "Microorganisms, such as parasites, bacteria, viruses, or fungi, that can cause disease in animals, including birds, and can be transmitted through contact with an infected individual or contaminated environment.", "Microscopic or submicroscopic agents that can cause disease or discomfort in living organisms, often introduced or transmitted through contact with an invasive species and its byproducts."], "Nuble region": ["A geographic area in Chile that is known for being a hub for the invasion of non-native bird species, and is characterized by the presence of a mixture of native and introduced bird fauna.", "A geographic area in Chile characterized by a specific combination of climate, terrain, and ecological features, featuring a particular set of flora and fauna that are susceptible to invasions by non-native bird species and their associated parasites.", "A mountainous region in Chile characterized by a diverse geography, with fertile valleys and hills where native wildlife and invasive species interact, having been shaped by human activities and environmental factors."], "Chile": ["A South American country where a centuries-old introduction of a non-native bird species has led to the discovery of a range of parasites, some of which may be posing a threat to the native avifauna, highlighting the potential consequences of invasive species on ecosystems.", "A South American country with a temperate climate, where the colonization of native ecosystems by a foreign species has introduced a range of potential pathogens that can be transmitted to local wildlife, thereby posing a threat to their health and well-being.", "A South American nation known for its long and narrow shape, which is home to diverse wildlife, including native birds, and has been affected by the introduction of non-native species, including the house sparrow, which has brought along its own parasites."], "arthropod species": ["Small, segmented organisms with jointed legs, exoskeletons, and typically multiple limbs, which can include insects, spiders, ticks, and others, and which are often parasites of animals and plants.", "Tiny, eight-legged creatures that include insects, spiders, and other related animals, which can infest and feed on the bodies of birds.", "Creatures with jointed limbs and a segmented body, typically characterized by having a hard outer shell and eight legs, and often found as external parasites on birds."], "helminth species": ["Worm-like parasites that inhabit the internal organs of birds, often characterized by a long, thin body structure.", "Microscopic, worm-like parasites that are typically found inside the body cavity or tissues of an organism, where they feed on nutrients or tissues.", "Tiny, worm-like organisms that infect the internal organs of animals, often causing disease or discomfort."], "Anonchotaenia globate": ["A type of tapeworm that is non-specific in terms of its definitive hosts, and is considered a potential threat to the health of native birds in Chile.", "A species of parasitic worm that attaches to birds and is potentially harmful to native avifauna due to its low specificity in its host range.", "A type of parasitic flatworm that, when introduced through a non-native bird host, can potentially infect and harm native bird populations, thereby exemplifying a possible consequence of species invasion."], "tapeworm": ["A type of parasitic intestinal worm that attaches to the small intestine of its host, obtaining nutrients by absorbing food as it passes through, and can be transmitted to new hosts through contaminated food or feces.", "A type of internal parasite that attaches itself to the digestive tract of its host, obtaining nutrients by breaking down the host's food before absorption, often causing physical discomfort, malnutrition, and potentially life-threatening complications if left untreated.", "A type of intestinal parasite that belongs to a group of segmented flatworms, often transmitted through contaminated food or water, and typically characterized by its distinctive morphology and complex life cycle."], "definitive hosts": ["The specific animals or species that serve as the ultimate hosts
