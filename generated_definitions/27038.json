robust agriculture, which is often referenced in discussions about quarantine pests and their control measures in the global context.", "A region in the Northern Hemisphere with a temperate maritime climate, characterized by a significant historical resistance to the invasion of a certain pest species, often referenced as a focal point for discussing and preparing for potential future outbreaks of this pest in other parts of the world."], "quarantine pest": ["A species of insect that has been actively prevented from entering or spreading through a geographic region, typically due to its potential to cause significant economic or environmental harm, and for which strict measures are in place to detect, contain, and eliminate any established infestations.", "A highly invasive and potentially devastating insect that has been deliberately excluded from a region's agricultural ecosystem, requiring specialized management and eradication techniques to prevent its establishment and
