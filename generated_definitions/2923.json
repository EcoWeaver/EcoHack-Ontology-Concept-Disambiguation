{"biological invasions": ["The process by which non-native species are introduced and establish populations in a new geographic area, often as a result of human activity, leading to potential ecological disruption and impact on native species and ecosystems.", "The unintended and often rapid dispersal of non-native organisms to areas where they are not typically found, driven by human activity, and resulting in changes to native ecosystems and potentially harm to native species.", "The unintentional or intentional transfer of a non-native species to a new environment, resulting in potential harm to the ecosystem, native species, or human health, through altered interactions between species, disruption of food webs, or transmission of new diseases."], "species distributions": ["The range and spread of distinct biological populations across the globe, encompassing the areas where they inhabit, migrate, or colonize, influenced by various factors such as climate, human activity, and ecological dynamics.", "The geographic range and relative abundance of a specific group of organisms in their natural environment, encompassing their dispersal, colonization, and persistence across different ecosystems and biomes.", "The geographic ranges where a specific type of organism is naturally found or has been introduced and established, often with variations in population density and adaptation over time."], "parasite": ["An organism that is able to inhabit and feed on the living tissues of another organism, often causing harm or disrupting its natural processes, which can have significant consequences for the invaded species, as well as potentially drive the spread of disease or alter ecosystem dynamics.", "An organism that exploits another species for its own survival, often causing harm or distress to the host while benefiting itself, potentially contributing to changes in the affected ecosystem.", "An organism that thrives in and feeds off the body or physiological processes of another species, often exploiting vulnerabilities and spreading disease, while also having the potential to alter the invaded species' ecology and distribution."], "biosecurity": ["The collective measures and strategies employed to prevent, detect, and mitigate the unintended and potentially devastating consequences of altering ecosystems through human activities, thereby preserving the natural balance and protecting vulnerable species from unwanted visitors that can carry and spread diseases, ultimately securing the long-term health and sustainability of the environment.", "The measures taken to prevent the intentional or unintentional transfer of pathogenic organisms from one ecosystem to another, thereby mitigating the risk of disease transmission and potential ecological disruptions.", "The prevention of harm or disruption caused by the unintended introduction and spread of potentially devastating entities, whether deliberate or accidental, from one ecosystem or species to another, thereby protecting the integrity and resilience of global biological networks."], "invasive species": ["A non-native organism that, through human activity, has successfully established and spread populations in new ecosystems, often outcompeting native species and altering the natural balance of the environment.", "A non-native organism that displaces native species in its new habitat by exploiting ecological niches or altering environmental conditions, often as a result of human activity, and poses a significant threat to biodiversity, ecosystem balance, and ecological integrity.", "Organisms that are introduced to a new geographic area by human activity and outcompete native species for resources, alter ecosystems, and can cause significant harm to the environment, economy, and human health."], "wildlife": ["A group of non-domesticated living organisms, typically including animals and plants, that inhabit a specific geographic area and are not cultivated or maintained by humans for food, medicine, or other purposes, and are instead subject to the natural forces of evolution and environmental pressures.", "The collective term for naturally occurring organisms, excluding those that are domesticated or managed by humans, which inhabit and evolve within specific environments.", "Organisms that inhabit a natural environment, not domesticated or cultivated by humans, and are not typically managed or cared for in the same way as livestock or crops, but may still be impacted by human activities."], "emerging diseases": ["New diseases or conditions that suddenly appear, spread, or intensify in a population or ecosystem, often due to changes in the environment, human activities, or shifts in the distribution of species, with potential significant impacts on the health and well-being of affected organisms.", "The unexpected proliferation of previously unknown or controlled microorganisms that affect the health and well-being of certain populations, typically facilitated by human-mediated changes to ecological environments and global connectivity, resulting in new challenges for conservation, public health, and ecosystems.", "The sudden or rapid spread of previously unknown or neglected microbial infections that threaten the health of wildlife populations and potentially pose a risk to human health, often triggered by changes in environmental or ecological factors."], "international policy": ["A framework of guidelines, regulations, and agreements established and implemented by a collective group of countries or organizations to coordinate actions and address common global challenges, with the goal of promoting cooperation, reducing threats, and ensuring the well-being of all parties involved.", "A framework of guidelines and regulations agreed upon by multiple national or regional entities to govern actions and decisions affecting global issues, with the goal of promoting cooperation, consistency, and mutual understanding.", "A coordinated set of guidelines and measures implemented across national borders to address and manage global phenomena that transcend local or regional boundaries, such as the spread of diseases and invasive species, with the goal of ensuring public health, environmental protection, and economic stability."], "disease emergence": ["The process by which pathogens or parasites that were previously absent or rare in a particular area or host species begin to appear or spread at an increased rate, potentially leading to significant impacts on ecosystems or human health.", "The process by which pathogens that were previously contained or unknown to a particular region or population suddenly appear, spread, and cause significant harm to its inhabitants.", "The process by which pathogens previously not found in a region or previously not affecting a particular host species begin to spread and infect, often as a result of human activities such as trade, travel, and habitat disruption, leading to significant impacts on ecological systems and potentially human health."]}
