non-native species to new ecosystems.", "The seawater retained by merchant vessels during their voyages to maintain stability and balance, which can harbor aquatic species and potentially introduce them to new environments when discharged at their destination ports.", "The seawater carried by a commercial vessel to maintain its stability and buoyancy during transit, which can potentially harbor non-native aquatic organisms that may establish invasive populations in destination ports."], "invasive species": ["Organisms that, when introduced to a non-native environment through human activity, can survive and reproduce with significant potential to harm the local ecosystem, alter native species populations, and potentially outcompete or displace them.", "A type of alien organism that, by its introduction to a new geographic area, becomes capable of colonizing and thriving, often with significant and detrimental ecological and economic impacts, in a manner that is disproportionate to its natural range.", "A non-native organism that, due to its ability to thrive in a new environment, poses a significant risk to the ecological balance and native species of a port's aquatic

carried on board ships through the careful management of water discharged during voyages, with the ultimate goal of protecting the marine environment and preserving its biodiversity.", "The process of monitoring and regulating the discharge of seawater from merchant vessels to prevent the accidental introduction of non-native aquatic species into recipient ports, thereby mitigating the potential environmental and ecological consequences."], "shipping pollution": ["The unintentional and often irreversible introduction of non-native aquatic organisms through the discharge of water from vessels, resulting in altered ecosystem dynamics and potential harm to native biodiversity.", "The unwanted introduction of non-native species into a marine ecosystem through the movement of water between

harmful environmental consequences resulting from the transport of organisms, materials, and waste across the world's seas and oceans, threatening the biodiversity and ecological balance of marine ecosystems."], "marine environment": ["The ecosystem encompassing the boundaries between the terrestrial and aquatic realms, comprising the complex interactions between species, habitats, and climatic conditions, where living organisms are exposed to and adapt to the influences of human activities and natural processes, and where the balance of biodiversity, ecological integrity, and sustainability is often compromised by invasive species and other forms of pollution.", "The complex network of ecological and physical factors that sustain aquatic life, including waters that support the introduction of invasive species through human activities such as shipping.", "The physical and biological space where aquatic organisms thrive, characterized by the interplay of ecological factors, chemical properties, and biological interactions that sustain the diversity and complexity of species and ecosystems."]}
