including birds, and are influenced by factors such as human activity, adaptation to environmental conditions, and reproductive potential.", "A complex network of interacting components, including organisms, their physical environment, and factors that influence their populations and communities, which is subject to constant changes and adaptations, and whose integrity is vital for maintaining a balanced and diverse range of biological phenomena.", "A dynamic assemblage of interacting components, comprising various species of organisms, their physical environments, and the interrelationships between them, which can be influenced by external factors such as human activity, and where the establishment or introduction of non-native species can disrupt the delicate balance

species into a new ecosystem, resulting in the establishment of a self-sustaining population that is able to reproduce and persist over time."], "exotic birds": ["Species of avian fauna that are non-native to a particular region, having been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans through human activity, trade, or other means, and have since established populations or thrived in that environment.", "Species of birds that have been introduced to a new geographic region outside their natural range, typically through human activity, and are not native to that region.", "Non-native bird species introduced to a new region or habitat, often through human activities such as trade, travel, or intentional release, which may threaten the ecological balance and biodiversity of the affected area."], "habitat": ["The zone or environment that an organism, particularly a bird species, has successfully adapted to and reproduced in after being transported to a new region, characterized by a set of variables that determine its likelihood of survival, growth, and establishment.", "The environment in which a species is naturally found or intentionally introduced, characterized by a set of conditions, including the number of invaded territories, adaptation to environmental factors, and reproductive potential, that influence its survival, spread, and establishment.", "The specific conditions, circumstances, and characteristics of a particular environment that influence the likelihood of an invasive species' survival, reproduction, and spread, thereby determining its ability to introduce and establish itself in a new region."], "invasion process": ["The phenomenon whereby a non-native species is introduced, establishes a population, and adapts to a new environment, often with potential consequences for the native ecosystem and biodiversity.", "The process by which a non-native species is introduced to a new region, gains a foothold,
