{"": ["The inherently probabilistic mechanism by which cells within a genetically identical population exhibit differing trait expressions, resulting from random fluctuations in the regulation of gene transcription, and allowing for the development of adaptive flexibility in response to environmental conditions.", "The random and unpredictable manner in which genetically identical cells within a population exhibit distinct properties or characteristics, leading to variations in gene expression and potential adaptations to environmental conditions.", "The unpredictable and variable pattern of gene activation or expression within genetically identical cells, leading to distinct phenotypes or functions."]}
