absence of aggression and cooperative behavior among individuals from the same grouping, while exhibiting intense aggression towards individuals from other groupings.", "A vast, interconnected network

another, sharing a common ancestry and exhibiting behavioral cohesion across different locations."], "main supercolony": ["A widespread, geographically dispersed collective of a certain ant species, exhibiting no aggression towards members of the same collective, but severe aggression towards individuals from a distinct, genetically distinct collective that is considered a rival.", "A dominant

ants that exhibits severe aggression towards members of a separate, similarly sized population that occupies a geographically adjacent area."], "aggression assays": ["A controlled observation of social behavior, typically involving the confrontation of individual workers from distinct populations, to assess the level of conflict, intolerance, or violence exhibited when members of different groups interact with one another.", "A systematic testing procedure used to measure the behavioral responses of individuals from different groups within a species, evaluating their interactions and reactions to each other, often involving the observation of specific physical or behavioral cues, such as combat or defensive postures, in order to determine the nature of their relationships and boundaries.", "A laboratory-based test designed to observe and measure the intensity of conflicts between individual ants of the same or different colonies, typically involving the release of chemical cues and physical interactions, in order to understand their social behavior and colonization patterns."], "Azores": ["A cluster of non-native populations of a certain insect species, originally from South America, that are geographically isolated but exhibit a unique behavioral relationship, demonstrating compatibility and shared ancestry with certain other non-native populations in a neighboring
