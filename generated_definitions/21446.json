web of relationships."], "Mass Ratio Hypothesis": ["A theoretical framework suggesting that changes in the abundance of individual plant species in a community are linked to changes in the total biomass or cover of the community, where an increase in the dominant species corresponds to a decrease in subordinate species, and vice versa.", "A long-established concept that posits the relationship between changes in plant community composition and shifts in overall biomass, where the magnitude of these changes determines the ecological consequences of functional trait variation.",
