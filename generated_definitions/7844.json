{"": ["A mathematical approach used in modeling spatially dependent data with a non-normal distribution, which is particularly effective in handling extreme observations and allowing for the estimation and prediction of parameters and random effects in a robust manner.", "A statistical technique used to model the relationship between a binary outcome and a set of spatially autocorrelated predictors, which allows for flexibility in the relationship between the outcome and the predictors by considering alternative link functions.", "A mathematical function used in statistical models that establishes a relationship between the response variable and the predictor variables, particularly in cases where the response variable is binary and has a non-Gaussian distribution."]}
