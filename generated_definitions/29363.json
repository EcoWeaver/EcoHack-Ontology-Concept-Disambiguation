balance of energy and resources in the ecosystem.", "The amount of a vital nutrient present in the upper layer of the earth's surface, which is essential for plant growth and development, and can significantly impact the competitive abilities of native and non-native plant species in a given ecosystem."], "soil salinity": ["The measure of the concentration of salt ions in the water present in a specific environment that affects the availability of water to plants, potentially leading to limitations in growth and development.", "The measure of the concentration of dissolved salts in the substrate beneath plant roots, affecting plant water availability and potentially influencing plant growth and competition, especially in areas where water limitations are significant.", "The condition of having an excess of dissolved particles, mainly inorganic, in the water portion of the soil, which can negatively impact plant growth by affecting water availability, especially during dry seasons, and altering the balance of resources available to plants."], "limiting resources": ["Factors that, when reduced in availability, would allow species to coexist, thrive, or outcompete others, and when increased in availability, could favor the proliferation or dominance of one species over others.", "Factors that restrict or constrain the growth and development of organisms in an ecosystem, influencing their ability to compete for space, light, water, and nutrients.", "A crucial component that restricts the growth or abundance of organisms in a given environment, where a decrease in its availability can lead to increased competition for that limitation among species."], "natural communities": ["An assemblage of plant and animal populations that coexist and interact within a shared environmental context, characterized by a dynamic balance of species and ecosystem processes that is shaped by geological, climatic, and ecological factors over time.", "A collection of plant and animal species that coexist and interact in a particular environment, forming a unique ecosystem that is shaped by factors such as climate, geology, and soil conditions.", "A complex network of interactions and associations between diverse organisms and their environment, comprising a distinct combination of abiotic factors and biotic components, which together shape the ecological dynamics and resilience of a particular geographic region."], "plant growth": ["The process by which plants increase in size, biomass, and reproductive capacity through the absorption and utilization of essential resources, such as nutrients and water, which is strongly limited during periods of drought.", "The outcome of a plant's physiological processes, influenced by environmental conditions, resulting in the measurable increase in mass, size, and reproductive capacity, ultimately impacting its ability to compete with other plants in its ecosystem.", "The physiological process
