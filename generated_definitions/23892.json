species in a given geographic range, leading to a change in the composition of the local ecosystem.", "The phenomenon where the populations of two co-occurring invasive species in a shared geographic range undergo a sequential decline, where one species is initially outcompeted and eventually replaced by the other, resulting in a dominant presence of the latter species in the affected area."], "geographic range": ["The region or area where a species has a presence or occurrence, encompassing all the various environments and habitats where its members are found, whether native or non-native, and which can vary in size, shape, and extent.", "The aggregate of areas occupied by a species, encompassing the vast expanse of diverse environments, topographies, and ecological niches that a species has colonized or has the potential to inhabit, influencing the dynamics and outcomes of interactions with other species within these spatially distributed locales.", "The region or extent of a species' presence and activity, encompassing all areas where its members are found, interact, and potentially overlap with other species."], "environment": ["The unique combination of factors that shape the ecological dynamics of a given area, encompassing both physical and biological elements that influence the distribution, behavior, and interactions of organisms within it, leading to varied outcomes in response to introductions of invasive species.", "The dynamic combination of factors that shape the ecological context, encompassing physical, chemical, and biological aspects that together determine the viability and behavior of living organisms, influencing their capacity to adapt, interact, and reproduce.", "The complex network of physical and biological conditions that can vary across geographic ranges, influencing the interactions and outcomes between species."], "introduced species": ["Species that have entered an ecosystem and are not native to it, often through human activity, such as transportation or trade, and are now capable of competing with and potentially replacing native species.", "A non-native organism that has established a population in a region through human activity, resulting in the potential for significant ecological and environmental impacts.", "Non-native organisms that have become established and are now thriving in a new geographical area through human activity or other unintentional means, often resulting in ecological and environmental impacts."], "co-occurrence": ["The phenomenon where multiple non-native species inhabit the same geographic region, often leading to interactions and impacts on their populations.", "The spatial overlap of two or more species, which allows for interactions to occur across a shared geographic range, resulting in a dynamic of influence and potentially leading to changes in population dynamics or distribution.", "The presence and overlap of two or more non-native species within a defined geographic area, resulting in a shared habitat and potential interactions between them, such as predation, competition, or other biological processes that can influence population dynamics."], "species interaction": ["The process by which multiple introduced species, existing in a shared geographic range, influence one another's survival, growth, and reproduction rates, potentially leading to changes in population dynamics and ecological succession.", "The phenomenon where two or more non-native species, co-occurring in a new geographic area, affect each other's populations, leading to a dynamic change in their relative abundance, distribution, or even replacement over time.", "The process by which introduced or resident species influence each other's population dynamics, demographic structure, or ecological role, often resulting in changes to their coexistence patterns, population size, or even displacement of one species by another."], "predation": ["The process by which one species, typically larger or more powerful, exploits the population of another species by feeding on its vulnerable young or juveniles, contributing to a decline in the latter's numbers and potentially leading to its displacement.", "The feeding behavior in which a species exploits and consumes a vulnerable portion of another species' life cycle, such as eggs, larvae, or juvenile individuals, thereby influencing the abundance and distribution of that species.", "The process by which one species, typically larger and more powerful, kills and feeds on another species, often involving a sequence of events such as stalking, ambushing, and consuming its prey."], "recruits": ["Young, newly hatched or settled individuals of a species that are vulnerable to predation and competition, and are crucial for the long-term survival and reproduction of the species.", "New shell-dwelling crustaceans that have recently molted from their juvenile or larval stages, marking the beginning of their adult life cycle.", "Newly hatched or settled individuals that are vulnerable to predation or other mortality factors in their early stages of life, and are an important life stage for understanding population dynamics and species interactions."], "diet shift": ["The change in the proportion or type of edible materials consumed by an organism in response to the presence or absence of a competing species, resulting in a shift away from its usual or optimal nutritional sources.", "The change in an organism's food preferences, resulting in a shift from its typical feeding habits to consume alternative, often unexpected, sources of sustenance, which can have profound effects on its reproductive capabilities.", "A change in the composition of a species' food intake, resulting in a substitution of a type of sustenance traditionally consumed with an alternative source of nutrients, leading to a deviation from the species' previously established feeding behavior and potentially influencing its reproductive capabilities."], "fecundity": ["The inherent capacity of an organism to produce viable offspring, typically measured by the number of eggs, larvae, or young produced per breeding cycle or individual.", "The number of offspring produced by an individual of a given species during its lifetime, typically influenced by factors such as diet and environment, which in turn affects the population's growth and survival.", "The ability of an organism to produce a sufficient number of viable offspring, typically measured by the average number of young produced per female per breeding event, which is essential for the perpetuation of its species."], "reproductive output": ["The quantity and quality of biological offspring produced by an individual or population over a specific period, encompassing the culmination of energy investment and resource allocation in ensuring the continuation of their lineage.", "The number of offspring produced by a species or individual, resulting from the successful combination of genetic material, typically measured as the quantity of viable or surviving progeny.", "The capacity of an organism to successfully produce offspring, often measured by the number of viable offspring produced in a given period of time or environment."], "near-shore current patterns": ["The movement of water along a coastline,

coastline, which affects the movement and distribution of organisms and influences the outcome of interactions between species.", "The subtle flow patterns that occur along the boundary between the ocean and the land, which can influence the dispersal and settlement of marine species and potentially play a role in shaping the outcome of species interactions."]}
