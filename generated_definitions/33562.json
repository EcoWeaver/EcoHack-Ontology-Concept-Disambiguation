body that contains most of its vital organs, through which invading pathogens can enter and cause harm.", "The internal cavity of an insect's body where vital fluids flow, allowing for vital functions to occur, which is breached by an invading organism that enters through natural openings such as the mouth or through other points of entry, causing damage and potentially leading to its demise."], "mosquito larvae": ["The early, aquatic stage of a certain type of insect, characterized by a non-flying, legless, and primarily feeding phase, which eventually undergoes metamorphosis to become a flying adult.", "The immature, aquatic stages of a particular arthropod that emerge from eggs and are susceptible to infection by a specific type of microscopic worm, characterized by their vulnerability to invasion and encapsulation.", "The early developmental stages of a specific insect species, characterized by their aquatic habitat, non-functional adult features, and dependence on external nutrition, that feed on small particles or organisms and eventually undergo metamorphosis to become adult mosquitoes capable of flying and reproduction."], "mortality": ["The event of an organism's inability to continue vital biological processes, resulting in a permanent loss of life, caused by internal damage or disruption of its biological functions.", "The irreversible cessation of development, growth, or vital functions of a living organism, ultimately leading to its demise, typically occurring as a result of external factors such as disease, infection, or exposure to a biocontrol agent.", "The condition of being completely eliminated or destroyed due to a biological agent, such as a microorganism or insect parasite, that causes the death of a host organism, often in a specific stage of development."], "EPNs": ["Microscopic worms that are capable of infecting and killing certain insects, such as mosquitoes, and have been used as a biological method for controlling agricultural pests and potentially managing disease-spreading insects.", "Microscopic worms that feed on and kill insects by attacking them internally and eventually breaking down their internal organs.", "Microscopic, worm-like organisms that feed on the internal tissues of insects and have been shown to be effective in controlling pest populations, and have also been investigated for their potential use in controlling mosquitoes that transmit diseases."], "encapsulation": ["The process by which invading microscopic organisms, in this case nematodes, are surrounded and protected by a cellular or biological barrier within the body of a host, such as a mosquito, to prevent them from causing further harm or damage.", "The process by which foreign invaders are wrapped in a protective layer, thereby hindering their ability to cause damage or complete their life cycle, while also preventing the host's immune system from fully eliminating the invader, allowing for a prolonged interaction between the two.", "The process by which a foreign organism is surrounded and contained by a protective barrier, preventing it from spreading and causing harm within the host's internal environment."], "melanization": ["A biological process in which foreign entities introduced into the body of an insect are enveloped by a dark, protective pigmentation, effectively restricting their further movement and potential harm to the host.", "The biological process by which a foreign substance, such as a nematode, is enveloped and darkened by a layer of pigment-like material produced by the host's immune response, resulting in its effective elimination or inactivation.", "The process by which an invading organism's proteins or other substances react with the host's cellular components, resulting in a darkened, hardened, and impermeable layer that confines and neutralizes the invader, thereby preventing further harm to the host."], "biocontrol agent": ["A living organism
