the availability of pollen from its own or other compatible plant species, making it dependent on adequate pollination to achieve optimal reproductive output.", "The circumstance where the reproductive output of a native plant species is constrained by a limited availability of a certain reproductive resource, leading to reduced fertility or offspring production, as a result of the
