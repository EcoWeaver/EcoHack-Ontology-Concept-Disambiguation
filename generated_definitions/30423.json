predators, including fleeing, taking risks, and other actions taken to mitigate the potential harm posed by these predators."], "feral cat": ["A non-native, domesticated cat that has established a self-sustaining population in the wild, and is known for its ability to recognize and exploit native mammals as prey, posing a significant threat to the survival of endemic species.", "A wild descendant of a domesticated species that has established a breeding population in a novel geographic area, recognized as a significant threat to native mammal populations due to its introduced status and voracious hunting behavior.", "A non-native, invasive species of small mammal that is known to hunt and devour native Australian mammals, often with devastating consequences for local populations and ecosystems, and is often considered a significant contributor to the country's poor record of mammal extinctions."], "European red fox": ["A highly invasive and adaptable mammal native to Europe, known for its ability to quickly colonize and devastate ecosystems in Australia, posing a significant threat to the country's native wildlife.", "A medium-sized, carnivorous mammal native to Europe and introduced to Australia over 150 years ago, which has had significant ecological impacts on the country's native wildlife.", "A species of canine predator native to Europe, introduced to Australia over a century and a half ago and now a key factor in the country's high rate of extinction and decline of native mammals."], "predator cues": ["The signals, signs, or stimuli emanating from an unknown or unfamiliar entity that evoke a reaction or response in a native mammal, indicative of its perception of potential predation.", "A warning signal that alerts native animals to the presence and potential threat of a predator, often in the form of a detectable stimulus that triggers a response, such as avoidance or defensive behavior, to mitigate the risk of predation.", "The detection and interpretation of sensory signals emanating from potential threats, such as sounds, smells, or visual appearances, that trigger a response in a prey species to avoid or prepare for predation."], "canid predator": ["A type of terrestrial carnivorous mammal belonging to a particular family of animals, characterized by their ability to hunt and kill small to medium-sized animals, often with a specialized sense of smell and hearing, and commonly found in various parts of the world in both wild and domesticated forms.", "A type of carnivorous mammal, related to domestic dogs and wolves, that has been present in Australia for thousands of years and may have influenced the development of predator recognition responses in native mammals.", "A type of carnivorous mammal that is characterized by its membership in a particular family of mammals, sharing common physical and behavioral traits with a notable subset of predators native to Australia, and being differentiated from other predators introduced to the continent."], "dingo": ["A canid predator that, in its native Australian range, provides a centuries-old precedent for local mammal populations to recognize and respond to novel predators, potentially influencing their reactions to introduced alien predators.", "A unique canid species that has co-evolved with Australian native mammals over thousands of years, providing a historical context for predator recognition and response.", "A certain canid predator native to Australia, which shares a predator-prey relationship with some of the Australian native mammals, thereby

injury, such as avoidance, vigilance, or defensive postures."], "risk-taking behaviour": ["The tendency for prey to behave in a manner that increases the likelihood of predation, such as approaching the predator's lair or abandoning cautionary measures, in response to a predator's presence or cue, despite the potential dangers.", "The propensity to exhibit behavior that increases the likelihood of encountering a predator, often accompanied by a perceived lack of concern for personal safety, resulting in a reduced ability to detect and respond effectively to potential threats.", "A behavioral
