non-native to a region, have established themselves, and pose a potential threat to the native ecosystem and human health, often by spreading diseases or outcompeting native species.", "A non-native mosquito population that has established itself in a particular region and has the potential to outcompete native species, alter ecosystems, or increase the risk of mosquito-borne disease transmission to humans or animals, through its ability to adapt to and thrive in new environments."], "Austria": ["A landlocked country located in Central Europe, bordered by Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Italy, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, with a mix of urban and rural areas featuring artificial and semi-natural habitats, and a climate influenced by its continental and alpine

its diverse natural landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and the presence of a nationwide monitoring program for potentially invasive mosquito species."], "ovitraps": ["A type of sampling device used to collect eggs from a specific location, typically at regular intervals, to monitor and identify various mosquito species.", "Devices that use artificial oviposition sites to collect and study mosquito eggs in a standardized manner, enabling researchers to gather information on the presence, distribution, and behavior of mosquito species in a given area.", "Small, stationary traps that collect and retain eggs of a specific type of insect, typically at a fixed location, allowing for the detection and identification of the species."], "Aedes albopictus": ["A species of mosquito commonly found in certain regions, known for its ability to transmit diseases and adapt to human-altered environments, which was discovered at two locations in a country where its presence had previously been documented, with a single additional sighting in a new province.", "A certain species of mosquito, also known as the \"tiger mosquito\", known to be an alien species in Austria and capable of being invasive, typically found in specific regions, such as motorway rest stops.", "A species of mosquito commonly known as the \"tiger mosquito\" that is native to Asia and is considered a potential invasive threat in Europe, characterized by its distinct striped pattern on its body and known to be a vector of various diseases."], "Aedes japonicus": ["A species of mosquito originating from Asia, commonly found in Austria and characterized by its widespread distribution across the country, preference for artificial habitats, and positive correlation with temperature.", "A widespread, cosmopolitan mosquito species known for its ability to thrive in various environments, particularly those with artificial surfaces, and is often found in higher numbers in regions with warmer temperatures.", "A mosquito species native to Asia, widely distributed across a country in Eastern Europe, characterized by its frequent presence in various habitats, including those with artificial surfaces, and its sensitivity to temperature and wind speed."], "artificial surfaces": ["Areas modified or created by human activity, devoid of natural vegetation, characterized by the presence of man-made structures, materials, or constructions, which can range from dense urban centers to roadsides, parking lots, or recreational areas.", "Areas with constructed or modified human-made structures, such as roadsides, parking lots, or urbanized zones, where the natural environment has been altered or replaced with materials like asphalt, concrete, or steel.", "Surfaces characterized by human-made alterations to the natural environment, often featuring concrete, asphalt, or man-made structures that provide breeding sites and habitats for certain species of mosquitoes."], "semi-natural areas": ["Regions with a mix of natural and human-altered features, where the natural landscape has been partially modified by human activities, but still retains some of its original characteristics.", "Environments that possess characteristics of both natural and artificial settings, featuring a mix of untouched vegetation, limited human impact, and occasional introduction of anthropogenic elements, which can influence the composition of species present.", "Areas that are characterized by a mixture of natural vegetation and human-altered features, often exhibiting a degree of modification, but still retaining some of the natural ecosystem's integrity."], "ambient temperature": ["The average environmental temperature that surrounds and influences the development and abundance of organisms, as measured and used in the context of a specific study or research program to understand their behavior and distribution.", "The air temperature in a given environment that is not explicitly influenced by artificial heat sources or direct sunlight, but is instead a natural result of the Earth's climate and geographical location.", "The measure of heat energy in the surrounding air that is typically taken into account when assessing the suitability of an environment for certain biological organisms."], "wind speed": ["The measure of how quickly air moves past a specific point, which affects the number of eggs laid by a particular species of mosquito in a given area.", "The rate at which air moves over a surface, affecting the number of eggs laid
