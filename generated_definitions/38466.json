particular species of invasive fish has been observed to appear unexpectedly.", "A geographic area drained by a river and its tributaries, where the water body is shared by neighboring countries and is home to a diverse range of aquatic species that can be affected by the presence of invasive species, with potential consequences for the ecosystem's balance and biodiversity."], "floodplain reservoirs": ["Bodies of water formed when a river's floodplain is inundated by excess water, often resulting in the creation of a temporary or permanent pool of water that can support aquatic life.", "Areas of a river basin where the river's water spreads out and slows down after flooding, creating a natural accumulation of sediment and vegetation that can be home to a diverse range of aquatic species.", "Bodies of water formed along the margins of a river, resulting from the accumulation of sediment and water behind natural or artificial barriers, such as meanders, oxbow lakes, or dams, which provide a habitat for aquatic species."], "Amur sleeper": ["A type of invasive fish species native to the Amur River basin, characterized by specific size and weight characteristics, which has

presence of the Amur sleeper."], "Amalby Lake": ["A mid-altitude body of still water located within a particular regional administrative division, playing a minor role in the study of invasive species' size and weight characteristics in a nearby river basin.", "A shallow freshwater body located in the floodplain of the Irtysh river basin, known for hosting a specific invasive species.", "A floodplain reservoir situated within the transboundary Irtysh river basin in Russia's Tyumen Region."], "Mangadaevo Lake": ["A remote, inland waterbody located in a region known for its geographical proximity to a major river, which is an international border between two countries, and is also part of a larger area with a diverse aquatic ecosystem.", "A lake located within the Yarkovsky District
