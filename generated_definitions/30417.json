rapidly across a region, forming large colonies and often displacing native species, due to its ability to adapt and thrive in its new environment.", "A non-native organism that has successfully colonized and spread to new areas, often with little to no ecological competition, thereby exhibiting significant impacts on the native ecosystem.", "A species that has spread beyond its native range, often unaided by human activity, and exhibits a propensity to dominate and displace indigenous species in the areas it colonizes, typically as a result of its ability to thrive in diverse environments and outcompete native species for resources."], "colonies": ["A dense aggregate of microscopic, self-reproducing organisms that coalesce to form a visible mass, often surrounded by a gelatinous substance, and exhibiting unique structural and compositional characteristics.", "A dense aggregation of individual organisms bound together by a shared extracellular substance, forming a visually
