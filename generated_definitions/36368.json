non-native mussels, have adapted to inhabit its brackish and saltwater environments.", "A southeastern region of the United States known for its estuaries, where native and non-native mussel species coexist and continued monitoring of introduced species is crucial to understand their ecological impact.", "A region in the southeastern United States characterized by a warm subtropical climate, home to a diverse array of aquatic life and prone to invasive species that can impact native ecosystems, including the presence of non-native mussels such as Perna viridis and Mytella charruana."], "Asian Green Mussel": ["A type of mollusk native to Asia that has been introduced to the estuaries of Florida, including the St. Johns River, and is known for its green-colored shell.", "A species of mussel that is native to tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but has been introduced to Florida's estuaries through human activity, where it has established a self-sustaining population.", "A type of mussel species native to Asia that has established populations in the estuaries of Florida, characterized by its presence in certain locations within the St. Johns River for the past 30 years."], "Charru Mussel": ["A type of marine bivalve mollusk, native to tropical and subtropical regions, that has been introduced to estuaries in Florida and is often found in areas with low salinity levels.", "A type of non-native bivalve mollusk, common in estuaries of the southeastern United States, characterized by a specific habitat preference for low-salinity areas and notable variation in density and size across different locations.", "A certain type of freshwater mussel that thrives in low-salinity environments and has been introduced to the St. Johns River estuary in Florida."], "Hooked Mussel": ["A specific type of mussel species native to the estuary, characterized by its presence at all sampling locations and varying density and shell length based on salinity levels, with a greater mean shell length observed at moderate salinity sites upriver.", "A freshwater mussel species native to the estuaries of Florida, characterized by its presence at a variety of sampling locations, higher density and larger mean shell length at moderate salinity sites upriver, and coexistence with invasive mussel species.", "A species of bivalve mollusk, characterized by its presence in the St. Johns River estuary, where it can be found in varying densities and shell lengths, and tends to thrive in moderate salinity environments."], "salinity": ["The measurement of the concentration of particles dissolved in a water body, primarily composed of ions such as sodium, chloride, and sulfate, which is commonly used to describe the degree of ocean-like conditions in a river or estuary.", "The proportion of dissolved salt in a body of water, particularly in an estuary, which is an indicator of its suitability for certain mussel species to thrive, with higher concentrations favoring the presence of some and repelling others.", "The measure of the concentration of salt in a body of water, typically expressed as a percentage, which affects the distribution and abundance of certain aquatic species, such as mussels, that are found in estuaries with varying levels of saltiness."], "native species": ["Species that have evolved and thrive in a specific ecosystem for an extended period of time, without human introduction or external influence, and are therefore naturally adapted to the environment and have a well-established presence.", "A species that has originated and evolved within a specific geographical area over a long period of time, without being introduced or intentionally relocated from another region, and is an integral part of the ecosystem's natural balance.", "Species that are originally from the region or ecosystem and have developed over time through evolutionary processes, establishing a natural balance and interaction with the environment and other species, unlike species that have been introduced through human activity or natural dispersal from elsewhere."], "non-native species": ["An organism originating from a distinct geographic region or ecosystem that has intentionally or unintentionally been introduced into a new environment, often resulting in potential disruption to the native ecosystem's natural balance and dynamics, and requiring ongoing surveillance to mitigate any adverse effects.", "Species of aquatic mollusks, introduced through human activity or natural dispersal, that inhabit a particular geographic region outside their native range, having adapted to new environments and potentially outcompeting or altering the native ecosystem.", "A species that is found in a specific region or ecosystem but did not evolve there and is likely to have a negative impact on the native biodiversity, economy, or ecosystem services."], "introduced species": ["Species that have been accidentally or intentionally transported from their native habitats to a new geographic area, where they establish themselves and often outcompete native species for resources, potentially disrupting the balance of the ecosystem.", "Non-native organisms that have established themselves in a new environment through human activity, human-assisted migration, or unintentional transport, often disrupting the native ecosystem and potentially causing ecological harm.", "A species that has entered and established itself in a new geographic area, often accidentally or intentionally, and has the potential to outcompete or displace native species, alter ecosystem dynamics, and pose a threat to biodiversity and ecosystem health."]}
