providing insight into the distribution of species diversity across different habitats."], "therophytes": ["A category of plants that thrive in disturbed environments, often characterized by rapid growth and reproduction, and typically rely on anthropogenic activities or natural disturbances for their sustenance and propagation.", "Plants that complete their life cycle within a year or less, and are often found in disturbed or human-altered environments, where they can rapidly colonize and thrive.", "Plants that thrive in environments where human activities have altered the natural state, often dominating in areas with frequent disturbance, and are therefore well-suited to take advantage of openings created by human presence."], "urbanization": ["The gradual process of human settlement and infrastructure development transforming natural habitats into areas dominated by human activity, leading to a decline in native plant species and an increase in invasive species.", "The increasing human modification and alteration of natural environments, leading to the creation of fragmented and developed areas that support a unique assemblage of species adapted to these conditions, which in turn can have a profound impact on the native biodiversity of surrounding ecosystems.", "The quantifiable expression of human presence and activity in an area, characterized by the percentage of land converted from natural to constructed environments, such as roads and buildings, which is inversely proportional to the species diversity and ecological integrity of the native flora."], "wind-flying
