the coexistence of human and non-human organisms.", "Areas where human settlements and human-made structures, such as buildings, roads, and green spaces, have been constructed, and where wild plants and animals have adapted to coexist with human activities, often exhibiting specific ecological conditions and interactions.", "The areas where human settlements and infrastructure blend with natural

concentration of man-made structures, such as buildings, pavement, and streetlights."], "spiders": ["Eight-legged, primarily terrestrial arthropods that weave silk to create protective webs, typically found in urban and semi-rural environments, and known to inhabit various structures such as buildings, fences, and trees.", "Organisms that belong to a class of arachnids characterized by the presence of silk glands, chelicerae with fangs, and eight legs, which are known for their ability to spin webs and are often found in various terrestrial environments, including urban areas.", "Eight-legged, segmented, and usually venomous terrestrial arthropods that inhabit a wide range of environments, often spinning silk webs to catch prey and protect themselves."], "Badumna longinqua": ["A type of spider that has invaded urban habitats in southern Brazil, known for its presence in public parks, window frames, and cemeteries, but is scarce in other areas such as national highways.", "A species of invasive spider, originally from a specific region, known to inhabit and weave webs in human-altered environments, such as urban parks and buildings, and is capable of dispersing over long distances.", "A type of spider that is native to certain regions, but has been introduced and is spreading to new areas, often colonizing urban environments such as parks, buildings, and cemeteries, and can be recognized by its web-building habits and distinctive presence in various public spaces."], "Desidae": ["A family of spiders characterized by their presence in urban environments, specifically in areas with human-made structures, and are capable of dispersing themselves along national highway routes.", "A group of spiders known for their webs and urban adaptability, often found in a variety of human-made environments such as parks, buildings, and graveyards.", "A family of spiders characterized by their urban habitat preferences and widespread distribution, often found in public areas, architecture, and grave sites, with a propensity to disperse along transportation routes."], "invasive species": ["A species that has expanded its geographic range beyond its native area and is now established in a new environment, often through human activity, and can potentially outcompete native species for resources and habitat.", "A non-native species that, through human activity or natural means, has colonized and begun to spread rapidly in a new geographic area, often outcompeting or displacing native species, and potentially causing harm to the local ecosystem.", "A non-native organism that colonizes and establishes a breeding population in a new region, potentially causing harm to the native ecosystem and altering its natural balance."], "public parks": ["Areas of landscaped land set aside for recreational use and aesthetic enjoyment by the general public, often featuring gardens, walkways, and recreational facilities.", "Areas of managed land and vegetation, often featuring walking paths, recreational facilities, and landscaping, that are open to the public for leisure, recreation, and relaxation, frequently maintained by municipal authorities.", "Areas of landscaped land designated for recreational and leisure activities, often maintained by local authorities or private entities, where humans and wildlife coexist."], "window frames": ["The structural components that separate and surround exterior spaces while providing ventilation and entry points to interior areas, often found in residential and commercial structures.", "The narrow, elevated structures separating and supporting panes of transparent or translucent materials that admit daylight and provide exterior views from indoor spaces, often found in dwellings and public buildings.", "Structural features of buildings or other structures that allow for the entry and exit of air, light, or insects, while providing a narrow opening or aperture that allows for panoramic views."], "cemetery": ["A place where the deceased are laid to rest, often surrounded by green spaces, structures, and other features that attract arachnid life.", "A designated area where the deceased are laid to rest, often surrounded by flora and used for contemplation, quietude, and occasionally, as a sheltered spot for a specific type of eight-legged arachnid to spin webs.", "A site where the deceased are typically buried, often with lush greenery and maintained landscaping, where spiders like Badumna longinqua may accidentally become entangled in the process of finding suitable habitats."], "national high-way route": ["A designated pathway or thoroughfare that connects multiple regions or localities, facilitating the movement of people, goods, and other entities over a large distance, often featuring linear infrastructure such as roads, highways, and interchanges.", "A linear infrastructure designed for rapid movement of vehicles along a specific path, facilitating connectivity and accessibility across geographic regions.", "A corridor of controlled access that connects major urban centers and allows for the free flow of traffic, typically constructed along a predetermined path."]}
