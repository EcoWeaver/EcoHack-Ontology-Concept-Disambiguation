that area.", "A species that has been present in an area for a sufficient amount of time to have developed adaptations to the local environment and has not been introduced by human activity, is well-established and forms an integral part of the ecosystem, and is not intentionally or unintentionally cultivated or kept for human use.", "A species that is indigenous to a particular region or ecosystem and has not been introduced or transported there by human activity, and is well-adapted to its natural environment."], "western fence lizards": ["A native species of lizard that is a well-established part of the ecosystem in Southern California, serving as a baseline for comparison in the study of invasive lizard populations that coexist with it in urban environments.", "A native

commonly found in the wild that serves as a control group in studies of invasive species in urban environments."], "Italian wall lizards": ["A species of lizard native to the Mediterranean region, widely introduced to urban environments in Southern California, where it co-occurs with other invasive and native lizard species, contributing to ecological dynamics.", "A species of small to

Southeastern United States, known for its ability to thrive in a variety of human-altered environments, including urban areas.", "A species of small, non-venomous lizards that are known to thrive in
