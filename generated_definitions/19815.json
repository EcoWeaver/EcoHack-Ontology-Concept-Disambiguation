pool of genetic material that serves as the basis for the establishment and subsequent spread of the species in its new environment."], "population expansion": ["A rapid increase in the geographic distribution and density of an organism's descendants, often driven by human activity, resulting in a higher similarity among individuals and reduced genetic diversity within regional groups.", "A rapid increase in the distribution and density of individuals within a region, resulting from the movement of a large number of founding individuals from a smaller source area, leading to the colonization of new habitats and alteration of the local ecological balance.", "The rapid and widespread dispersal of individuals from a founding group, resulting in the establishment of a large and genetically diverse group within a new geographic area."], "human activity": ["The intentional or unintentional movement of organisms or organisms' genetic material through intentional or unintentional means, resulting in their redistribution and alteration of ecosystems, often facilitated by human migration, trade, or environmental alterations.", "The intentional or unintentional dispersal of organisms from one geographic location to another through deliberate human actions, such as colonization, trade, travel, or horticulture, resulting in the introduction of non-native species to new ecosystems.", "The intentional or unintentional transportation and dispersal of living organisms from one geographic area to another through deliberate or accidental means, often facilitated by human presence, migration, or trade, which can alter ecosystems and impact native biodiversity."], "nuclear microsatellite markers": ["Tiny, repeating sequences of DNA code that are scattered throughout the genetic material found in the cells' control centers, allowing researchers to identify and compare variations between different populations of organisms.", "A type of genetic identifier used to analyze and compare the DNA of a species, which targets short, repetitive DNA sequences found in an organism's nucleus and can produce multiple distinct patterns, making it possible to score the presence or absence of specific sequences in a range of sizes.", "Short, repeated sequences of DNA found in the non-recombinant portion of an organism's genome that are useful for identifying and distinguishing between different populations, species, or individuals."], "microsatellite markers": ["A type of genetic tool used to identify and track the distinct patterns of inherited characteristics found within specific populations, allowing researchers to analyze and compare the genetic makeup of different groups within a species.", "Short segments of repetitive DNA
