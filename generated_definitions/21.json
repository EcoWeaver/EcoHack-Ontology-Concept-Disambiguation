outcompeting native species and causing significant ecological changes, ultimately resulting in a lasting impact on the invaded ecosystem.", "The unaided movement and establishment of a non-native organism in a new geographic region, often accompanied by the displacement of native species and potentially leading to ecological and evolutionary changes, which can have significant consequences for

body structure in response to predator presence, thereby enhancing its survival and invasive capabilities in novel environments.", "A small, aquatic invertebrate that is native to warm and humid regions, but has been introduced to new environments where it can rapidly spread and dominate, often thanks to its unique ability to change its physical appearance in response to potential threats.", "A small, aquatic crustacean native to tropical regions, characterized by its ability to adapt its body shape in response to environmental cues, specifically as a defense mechanism against predation, which enables it to thrive in new and potentially hostile environments."], "thermal tolerance": ["The ability of an organism to thrive and survive in a wide range of environmental temperatures, allowing it to adapt and establish itself in new areas with varying climatic conditions.", "The ability of a species to persist and thrive in a wide range of environmental temperatures, potentially allowing it to establish itself and expand its range in response to changing climatic conditions.", "The capacity of an organism to thrive and adapt in a wide range of environmental temperatures, allowing it to establish a strong presence in diverse ecosystems and rapidly spread in response to changes in its thermal environment."], "global climate change": ["The gradual, long-term shift in the Earth's temperature and weather patterns caused by the gradual accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which is altering the environment and increasing the likelihood of extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and more frequent and intense natural disasters.", "A natural phenomenon characterized by a gradual, long-term increase in the average temperature of the Earth's surface, which has significant impacts on the distribution and abundance of living organisms, altering the balance of ecosystems and favoring the establishment and spread of species better adapted to the changed conditions.", "The phenomenon characterized by a gradual, long-term shift in the Earth's temperature and atmospheric conditions, ultimately influencing the distribution, behavior, and survival of various organisms, including aquatic species, and potentially affecting the success of invasive species in novel environments."], "establishment": ["The successful and permanent colonization of a new region by a non-native species, resulting in its growth and reproduction without significant decline or regression.", "The process by which a non-native species becomes a self-sustaining component of its environment, capable of reproducing and maintaining a stable population over time.", "The ability of a non-native species to become a self-sustaining and widespread part of its new environment, typically through a process of adaptation and competition, allowing it to thrive and propagate over time."], "rapid spread": ["The sudden and widespread establishment of a non-native species across a geographic region, enabled by its ability to adapt to and thrive in new environments, resulting in a significant and long-lasting impact on the native ecosystem.", "The accelerated expansion and geographic range expansion of a non-native species, resulting in its successful establishment and prevalence in a new ecosystem.", "The swift and widespread geographic expansion of a species, facilitated by its ability to thrive in various environmental conditions and adapt to new ecosystems, allowing it to occupy a significant amount of territory and interact with a large number of other species in a relatively short period of time."], "inducible defence": ["A mechanism that allows an organism to adjust its physical appearance or traits in response to a specific environmental cue, serving as a protective barrier against a predator or competitor, and enabling it to thrive in situations where it would otherwise be vulnerable.", "A unique and adaptive response triggered by specific environmental cues, resulting in a phenotypic change that enhances an organism's ability to resist or evade predation.", "A unique ability of certain organisms to modify their physical structure or appearance in response to a specific environmental cue, such as a predator's chemical release, in order to deter or defend against a potential threat, ultimately enhancing their survival and competitive advantage in a particular ecological setting."], "morphologically plastic traits": ["A characteristic or feature that undergoes a change in form or structure in response to environmental cues or stimuli, allowing an individual to adapt to specific conditions or pressures and thereby enhance its survival and reproductive success.", "A characteristic that changes its appearance or form in response to environmental cues, allowing an organism to adapt and modify its defenses or behavior in reaction to specific stimuli or threats.", "The ability of an organism's physical features to change in response to environmental cues, such as chemical signals, resulting in the development of structures or characteristics that provide adaptive advantages for survival or defense."], "predator-mediated switch in dominance": ["The phenomenon where a species changes from being subordinate to a dominant competitor in an environment, triggered by the presence of a specific environmental factor, ultimately allowing it to successfully invade and establish itself in a new area.", "The phenomenon where a species' competitive advantage or disadvantage is altered in the presence of a predator, resulting in a change in dominance, with the species that is better equipped to defend against predation gaining a competitive edge.", "A phenomenon in which the competitive relationship between two species is altered due to the presence of a third species, typically a predator, resulting in a change in the dominance of one species over the other, often favoring the invasive species."], "key adaptation": ["A biological trait or characteristic that plays a crucial role in an organism's ability to successfully establish and thrive in a new environment by providing a unique advantage over native species, often in response to environmental pressures or threats.", "A specific attribute or characteristic that enhances an organism's ability to thrive in a particular environment or ecological context, often conferring a significant competitive advantage or survival benefit.", "A biological characteristic that significantly enhances an organism's ability to establish and spread in a new environment by dynamically adjusting its defense mechanisms in response to ecological pressures, thereby contributing to its invasive success."]}
