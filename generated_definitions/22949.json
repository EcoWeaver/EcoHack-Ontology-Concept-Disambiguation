new environments or regions.", "Organisms that are non-mammalian, non-avian, and non-fish, but are still capable of migrating into and establishing themselves in a foreign ecosystem, potentially causing harm to native species and disrupting the balance of the environment.", "Organisms that are non-vertebrate animals, capable of being introduced to a new environment, potentially causing harm to native ecosystems and economies, and require monitoring and detection to prevent their introduction and spread."], "surveillance system": ["A systematic network of monitoring and detection devices and strategies designed to identify and track a wide range of unwanted and potentially harmful biological organisms, optimized for efficiency and effectiveness within resource constraints.", "A network of monitoring tools and resources strategically placed and optimized to detect and track the presence of diverse invasive species across a varied terrain, in order to mitigate potential threats to environmental and economic stability.", "A strategic network of distributed monitoring points, designed to capture and analyze a wide range of invasive species across diverse environmental settings, with the goal of mitigating potential ecological and economic harm."], "differential risk": ["The phenomenon where the likelihood and/or impact of an event or outcome varies significantly depending on specific circumstances, resulting in a need for tailored strategies and resource allocation to effectively mitigate or prevent it.", "The concept refers to the varying likelihood of a biological invasion's impact or consequence on the environment and economy, which requires consideration in the design of surveillance systems to allocate resources effectively and minimize losses.", "The varying likelihood of harm or disturbance posed by different invasive species across a diverse range of ecosystems, requiring tailored measures to mitigate these potential threats."],

costs.", "The discipline of preventing the intentional or unintentional introduction, establishment, and spread of non-native organisms, including pests, pathogens, and invasive species, across borders, landscapes, and ecosystems, to mitigate the economic, environmental, and ecological harm they can cause.", "The practice of protecting and safeguarding the health and integrity of the natural environment, including ecosystems and the diversity of living organisms that inhabit them, from the intentional or unintentional introduction and spread of non-native species that can cause harm or disruption to the ecosystem, human populations, and the economy."], "labour costs": ["The human resources and related expenditures necessary to operate and maintain a surveillance system, encompassing personnel, training, and logistical expenses.", "The aggregate expense of personnel required to operate and maintain a surveillance system, encompassing the quantifiable value of the human resources invested in its day-to-day functioning, from data collection to system optimization.", "The sum of the expenses incurred by personnel involved in the collection and processing of surveillance data, including the time and effort required to maintain and utilize detection devices."], "detection devices": ["Portable or stationary monitoring systems, designed to actively detect and report on the presence of invasive species, such as pests or diseases, within a specific environment or region.", "Tools or instruments designed to monitor and identify the presence of invasive species, used in a surveillance system to detect and track a range of invertebrate invasives across a heterogeneous sampling frame.", "Devices deployed across a heterogeneous sampling frame to detect the presence or absence of invasive species, designed to balance the trade-off between the risk of not detecting a target species and the cost of deploying the devices."], "resource constraints": ["The limiting circumstances that govern the allocation of detection devices and labour to ensure the most effective and efficient use of available funding and personnel to detect invasive species, while maintaining a balance between coverage and cost.", "The limitation imposed by the available budget and capacity to execute a plan, causing a compromise between the number of detection devices and their allocation
