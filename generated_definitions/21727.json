extreme conditions of frequent exposure to and immersion in sea water, often characterized by intense sunlight, strong currents, and desiccation.", "The area along a coastline where the height of the land above the water's surface changes constantly due to the gravitational pull of the moon and sun, resulting in a zone of shifting water levels that can harbor distinct communities of plants and animals.", "The zone of constant immersion and exposure, characterized by varying levels of oceanic influences, where the interplay between sea level and shoreline produces distinct conditions that
