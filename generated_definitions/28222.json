various levels of specificity to describe their shared attributes and distinguish them from other organisms.", "A collective classification of organisms based on shared characteristics, such as physical appearance, behavior, or genetic makeup, which is used to group and distinguish distinct categories of living things.", "A category that identifies and organizes a large number of distinct living organisms based on their shared characteristics, features, and evolutionary relationships, providing a hierarchical framework for classification and understanding the diversity of life."],

environments, collected from the compartments of ships entering a particular ecosystem.", "A collection of small, typically microscopic, aquatic organisms that drift in the water column and are characterized by their abundance and diversity, reflecting the complex interactions between water temperature, nutrient levels, and other environmental factors.", "A collection of tiny, usually microscopic, aquatic animals, such as crustaceans, rotifers, and small fish, that live in a particular body of water and drift or float with the current, often forming a community or ensemble."],

in environments with a limited or no supply of salt.", "Organisms that thrive in water bodies with a significant proportion of land-based runoff, characterized by limited salinity and a dependence on terrestrial ecosystems for survival.", "Organisms that thrive in bodies of water with a limited or no direct connection to the ocean, characterized by a specific set of biological and ecological adaptations that enable them to survive in these environments."], "marine species": ["Organisms that typically live in saltwater environments, have evolved adaptations to thrive in these conditions, and can sometimes be found in freshwater systems through human-mediated transport or other unusual pathways.", "Organisms that thrive in environments with high salt concentrations, typically found in shallow, coastal waters, and are adapted to withstand the constant presence of seawater.", "A type of aquatic organism that typically thrives in saltwater environments, such as oceans and seas, and can potentially establish populations in freshwater environments like the Great Lakes via human-mediated introductions, potentially outcompeting native species."], "individual specimens": ["A measurable unit of biological material collected from a sample, typically comprising a single organism or portion thereof, used to characterize the composition and diversity of a specific ecological community.", "A measure of the smallest units of biological organisms, each representing a distinct species, genus, or higher taxonomic group, that are collected and analyzed in a scientific study.", "A distinct sample of an organism, which can be identified to a specific type, used to gauge the diversity and frequency of species transported through a specific route, in this case, ships' ballast water and sediments."], "species level": ["The taxonomic classification at which an organism is recognized as a distinct, individual unit based on its unique physical and biological characteristics, separate from other organisms, and used as a basis for identifying and distinguishing the organism.", "The precise point of classification at which the unique characteristics of an organism, as identified through scientific examination, are distinguished and distinguished from other similar organisms.", "The highest level of identification accuracy, referring to the categorization of an individual specimen to a specific group within a larger taxonomic hierarchy, indicating a high degree of certainty and precision about its biological affiliation."], "nonindigenous species": ["Organisms that are foreign to a specific region or ecosystem and have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced through human activity, potentially altering the native biodiversity and ecological balance.", "A type of organism that has been introduced to a region or ecosystem from a different geographic area, often through human activities such as shipping or trade, and has not naturally migrated to that location.", "A species that has colonized a region outside of its native range, having been introduced through human activity, and is not naturally found in that area."],
