resulting in alterations to the natural food web and potentially devastating ecological consequences.", "The phenomenon of non-native, free-living organisms intentionally or unintentionally introduced into a waterbody, altering the local ecosystem's balance and potentially disrupting the food chain, predator-prey dynamics, and population structures.", "The unintended introduction of a non-native species into a marine ecosystem, leading to alterations in the local food web and potential declines in the abundance of native species."], "cladoceran": ["A type of small, aquatic, planktonic crustacean that plays a crucial role in the marine food chain, and its sudden and significant decline in abundance can have far-reaching effects on the entire ecosystem.", "Small, usually microscopic, freshwater or marine crustaceans that have a distinctive body shape featuring a distinctive set of antennae, often serving as a crucial link between primary producers and larger predators in aquatic food chains.", "A small, typically tiny, aquatic crustacean that feeds on microscopic organisms and is part of the zooplankton community in the marine ecosystem."], "Baltic Sea": ["A semi-enclosed brackish body of water located in Northern Europe, characterized by a complex system of inflowing rivers and outflowing saline water from the North Sea, supporting a diverse range of marine life and susceptible to the impacts of invasive species.", "A brackish body of water located in Northern Europe, bounded by the coasts of Sweden, Finland, Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Germany, which is prone to invasions of non-indigenous species and exhibits significant changes in its food webs over time.", "A large body of brackish water located between the Scandinavian and Continental European coastlines, separating the northern part of Europe from the eastern part of the Baltic States and the eastern part of Germany, characterized by complex hydrological dynamics and significant impact on regional ecosystems."], "time series": ["A sequence of regularly spaced observations or measurements recorded over a continuous period of time, which allows for the examination of changes and patterns in a specific phenomenon or variable, enabling researchers to analyze and understand its dynamics and trends across different time periods.", "A continuous sequence of measurements or observations taken at regular intervals, often over a long period, which enables the examination of patterns, trends, and changes in a specific phenomenon or process.", "A comprehensive collection of repeated measurements or observations, obtained at regular intervals over a prolonged period of time, providing a continuous record of fluctuations and patterns in a particular phenomenon or system, allowing for the identification of trends, changes, and relationships."], "food webs": ["A complex network of interdependencies among organisms in an ecosystem, involving the feeding relationships and interactions between species, which can be affected by the introduction of a non-native species, leading to changes in the abundance and distribution of prey and predators.", "A network of interconnected relationships between diverse biological entities, where each entity plays a specific role in influencing the availability, abundance, and distribution of other entities, and where disturbances to one entity can have cascading effects throughout the network.", "A complex network of interconnected interactions between different species and their physical environment, where the abundance and distribution of each species influence and are influenced by those of other species, ultimately determining the structure and dynamics of the ecosystem."], "predation": ["The process by which a population of animals that feed on other animals, such as small crustaceans, modifies the composition and abundance of its food source over time, often resulting in a decline in the abundance of prey species, as a consequence of their feeding behavior.", "The process by which a consumer species, often a predator, affects the population dynamics of its prey species through direct feeding interactions, leading to changes in prey abundance, distribution, and seasonal patterns.", "The act of a dominant species exerting a suppressive influence on the populations of its potential food sources, leading to alterations in abundance, distribution, and temporal patterns of these species."], "zooplankton prey": ["Small, primarily aquatic animals that are the preferred food source of certain predatory invertebrates, which can undergo significant changes in abundance and seasonal patterns in response to the invasion of a non-native species.", "Small, usually microscopic or nearly
