mechanisms and ecological impacts.", "Controlled laboratory setting designed to mimic natural aquatic environments, allowing for the observation and experimentation on specific biological phenomena."], "presence of male": ["The absence of an individual of the same species, not in close proximity or involved in breeding activities, yet providing an ambient influence that does not

a native species, without the co-presence of other individuals of the same species.", "The state of having a non-breeding, solitary individual of a foreign species within close proximity to a group of
