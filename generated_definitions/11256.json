species, exerting a significant impact on their populations and ecological dynamics.", "Species that exploit a resource in their environment by consuming a portion of the prey population, thereby influencing the dynamics of the affected ecosystem through their feeding activities.", "Organisms that consume prey species and exert a specific influence on the ecological community, as demonstrated by their per capita effects and abundances relative to native counterparts."], "prey species": ["Organisms that are subject to predation by invasive fish species, serving as a food source and playing
