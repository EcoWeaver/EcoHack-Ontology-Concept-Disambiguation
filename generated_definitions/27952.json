{"benthic invasive species": ["A type of marine species that has been transported from one location to another, typically by human activity, and has established a self-sustaining population in a new

equilibrium.", "The icy, remote region at the southern tip of a major continent, characterized by its extreme climate and unique, isolated marine ecosystem, where the Antarctic Ocean meets the land."], "Southern Ocean": ["The ocean surrounding a continent of unique and endemic marine life, isolated from the rest of the world's oceans for millions of years, until recently exposed to human-mediated introduction of non-native species.", "The vast body of water surrounding a unique and isolated ecosystem, characterized by its frigid climate, limited species diversity, and geographical isolation from other marine ecosystems, which is now being threatened by the introduction of non-native species via human activities.", "The cold, nutrient-rich ocean that surrounds the

have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a previously isolated ecosystem, having evolved in a different environment, and potentially causing harm to the native species and ecological balance through competition for resources, habitat alteration, or predation.", "An organism that is introduced to a new ecosystem through human activity, where it establishes a self-sustaining population and causes harm to the native species, disrupting the balance of the ecosystem and potentially leading to long-term ecological and economic consequences.", "A species that has been transported by humans or natural means to an area where it has no native presence, is capable of reproducing and establishing a population, and potentially outcompetes or disrupts the local ecosystem, often leading to harmful effects on the native biodiversity."], "Antarctic Southern Ocean marine fauna": ["A distinct array of marine species that have evolved over millions of years in a unique and isolated environment, characterized by a distinct gene pool and ecological interactions that are specific to this region, making them particularly vulnerable to disruption by the introduction of non-native species.", "The unique and distinct assemblage of marine organisms that are native and indigenous to the Antarctic region, having evolved over millions of years in isolation from other marine ecosystems, and characterized by specialized adaptations to the harsh and extreme conditions of the Antarctic environment.", "The collective assemblage of marine animals that have evolved over millions of years in the isolated and extreme environment surrounding Antarctica, characterized by a unique set of species that have adapted to the harsh conditions and are endemic to the region."], "human-mediated influx": ["The introduction and movement of non-native species into an ecosystem through activities or processes controlled or facilitated by human beings, resulting in an altered distribution of species and potential disruptions to the native environment.", "The unintentional or intentional movement of organisms or species from one location to another through human activities, which can lead to the introduction of non-native species into a new ecosystem, potentially causing harm to the native biodiversity.", "The introduction of non-native organisms into an ecosystem through activities carried out by humans, such as transportation, trade, or other human endeavors, resulting in the colonization of an area previously devoid of these species."], "exotic species": ["A type of species that originates from a different geographical region, typically introduced to a new area through human activities, such as shipping or climate change, and can potentially outcompete or displace native species, altering the local ecosystem's composition and functioning.", "A species that is not native to a particular region, having been introduced by human activity, and may potentially disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem.", "A non-native species that originates from outside the region or ecosystem in which it is found, often introduced through human activities and potentially threatening the native biodiversity and ecological balance."], "non-indigenous species": ["A species that has been introduced to a new geographic region through human activity, often with the potential to disrupt the natural balance and ecosystem of that area, and may pose a threat to the native flora and fauna.", "Species that have been introduced to a region or ecosystem by human activity and are not native to that area, potentially disrupting the natural balance and posing a threat to the native species and ecosystem, as exemplified by the case of the North Atlantic spider crab found in the Antarctic Peninsula.", "A type of species that originates from a different geographic location and is intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new region through human activities, posing a risk to the native ecosystem and potentially causing significant ecological and economic impacts."], "Antarctic marine biota": ["The complex community of plant and animal life
