{"biological invasions": ["The uncontrolled introduction and establishment of non-native organisms, often unintentionally, which can outcompete native species for resources, alter ecosystems, and cause significant economic, environmental, and human health impacts.", "The unauthorized and uncontrolled arrival and establishment of a non-native species in a new geographical area, where it can potentially cause harm to the native ecosystem, economy, and human health.", "The spread of non-native species across large geographical areas, often through human activity or natural means, resulting in adverse ecological impacts on native ecosystems and potentially disrupting local biodiversity."], "geographical": ["A method of representing the spatial relationships between points, features, and boundaries on the Earth's surface, encompassing both static and dynamic aspects, including location, scale, and time, in a visual and interactive way, allowing for the identification and analysis of patterns, trends, and correlations.", "The scope or area that defines the physical location of an event, covering vast territories and allowing for the visualization and analysis of occurrences in a broader spatial context.", "The process of identifying, reporting, and visualizing the physical locations and boundaries of specific phenomena, allowing for the display of detailed information about those locations and boundaries."], "temporal events": ["Occurrences that have a specific order or sequence in terms of time, often displayed through a visual representation that shows how these events unfold over a specified period.", "The occurrence of a biological event at a specific moment or period in time, which can be visualized and tracked through a timeline or sliding window, allowing for the analysis and comprehension of its spatial and temporal patterns.", "A series of occurrences or developments that unfold over a period of time, allowing for analysis of how an event evolves or changes over time."], "invasive species": ["A non-native organism that occurs and spreads rapidly, often outcompeting native species for resources and disrupting ecosystem balance, leading to significant ecological, economic, and environmental impacts.", "Organisms that, having been introduced to a particular geographical area through human activity or natural means, colonize and spread rapidly, often outcompeting native species for resources, causing ecological disruptions and potentially harming local ecosystems and biodiversity.", "A type of organism that has colonized a new geographical area and is causing harm to the native ecosystem, often displacing native species and altering the local environment."], "pest distribution": ["The geographical pattern of spreading or dispersal of a non-native organism, often triggered by human activity or climate change, which can have significant ecological and economic impacts.", "The geographic pattern or spread of species deemed harmful to the environment, agriculture, or human health, which is dynamically represented and updated through a digital platform.", "The geographic spread of organisms that are deemed harmful to an ecosystem or environment, as reported and visualized through an online mapping tool."], "pest occurrences": ["Unnoticed or sudden appearances of unwanted, foreign organisms in a particular region or area, which can have significant impacts on the local ecosystem and economy.", "Incursions of non-native organisms or unwelcome species that disrupt the ecological balance and may cause harm to local flora, fauna, or human populations.", "The arrival and spread of non-native organisms in a particular region, often causing harm to local ecosystems and environments, which are typically tracked and monitored through data gathering and mapping."], "research activities": ["A systematic exploration, documentation, and analysis of phenomenon, incidents, or occurrences within a specific geographical area or scope, aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of their nature, behavior, and impacts, ultimately informing decision-making and policy development.", "The systematic investigation of phenomena and events of biological interest, undertaken to gain a deeper understanding of their causes, effects, and distributions.", "Scientific investigations and studies carried out to gather and analyze information about the spread, impact, and control of invasive species and pests, aiming to advance understanding and inform management strategies."], "region": ["A geographical area defined by natural or administrative boundaries, used to categorize and filter reported biological events within a specified range of latitude and longitude coordinates.", "A specific area of interest that is defined by boundaries or coordinates, allowing users to filter and focus on a particular set of events, occurrences, or phenomena.", "An area of the Earth's surface that can be defined and bounded by geographic coordinates, where data related to biological events can be reported, viewed, and displayed on a digital map."], "country": ["A geographic entity with recognized sovereignty and boundaries, playing a significant role in categorizing biological events in the context of pestMapper.", "A political or administrative unit of a large territory that is usually recognized by international law and contains its own government, borders, and defined population.", "A geographic entity that is typically represented on a world map as a bounded region with a distinct political identity and is often associated with a shared culture, language, and government."], "time": ["A specific point or interval along a linear progression of sequential events, used to quantify the duration between events and the frequency of their occurrence.", "A measure that allows users to visualize and analyze the pattern of occurrence, duration, or progression of events over a sequence of moments in the past, present, or future, enabling the observation of trends, fluctuations, or cycles, and facilitating the identification of key events, milestones, or critical junctures.", "A measurement used to categorize and track the occurrence of biological events, allowing users to visualize and analyze their progression over a continuous spectrum, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the patterns and dynamics of these events."], "pest outbreaks": ["A sudden and significant occurrence of a non-native species spreading rapidly and causing harm to the ecosystem or economy, often requiring immediate attention and action.", "A sudden and unexpected spread of a previously contained or localized species distribution, potentially causing significant ecological or economic harm to a specific geographic area.", "A sudden and significant occurrence of a non-native species or organism in a particular area, often causing disruptions to local ecosystems and posing a threat to the environment, agriculture, or human health."]}
