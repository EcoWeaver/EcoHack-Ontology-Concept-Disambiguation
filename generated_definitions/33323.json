phenomenon where small species tend to evolve to grow larger when isolated on an isolated region, whereas large species tend to evolve to shrink or remain smaller in the same environment, potentially resulting in a reversal of typical size patterns observed in mainland populations.", "A phenomenon whereby certain characteristics of organisms, such as body size, undergo a consistent trend of increase in smaller species and decrease in larger species when found on isolated geographic locations compared to their mainland counterparts, while other characteristics may exhibit inconsistent or contradictory patterns."], "animals": ["Organisms that have the characteristic of undergoing developmental changes from juvenile to adult forms through a process that involves morphological modifications, primarily involving body size, shape, and structure, which differentiate them from other organisms that undergo a different developmental pathway.", "Organisms that are typically

dimension, often influenced by its environment, and can vary in response to evolutionary pressures, thereby affecting its overall morphology and functionality.", "The linear dimension or geometric proportion that describes the extent or magnitude of an organism's body or structures, as opposed to other characteristics such as reproductive output or metabolic activity.", "The quantitative measure of a biological entity's physical manifestation, encompassing the linear dimension, area, or volume of its parts, and often indicative of its metabolic and reproductive demands, as well as environmental interactions."], "vegetation": ["The collective aggregation of static, multicellular structures that provide sustenance and support through photosynthesis, often exhibiting a range of

it, and which can be used to predict its response to changes in that environment."], "": ["The phenomenon in which certain biological characteristics of organisms, when compared across islands and mainland areas, exhibit a reversal of size trends, where smaller species tend to increase in size and larger species tend to decrease in size over time.", "The tendency for certain physical characteristics in a species to undergo a consistent pattern of change, with smaller individuals of a species generally increasing in size on isolated landmasses, while larger individuals of the same species decreasing in size, and with the intensity of this pattern varying across different traits within a species.", "A phenomenon in which the physical characteristics of certain species, observed across various geographic isolations, tend to shift in predictable patterns, with smaller organisms tending to increase in size and larger organisms tending to decrease in size, as a result of
