originally native to the Iberian Peninsula, but has been introduced to other parts of Europe and poses a significant threat to local ecosystems due to its invasive population.", "A species of terrestrial mollusk native to the Iberian Peninsula that has been introduced to other parts of Europe, causing significant harm to horticultural and agricultural industries, and is now being studied for its natural predators."], "invasive species": ["A non-native organism whose sudden and often uncontrolled spread in a new environment causes significant harm to the native ecosystem, economy, and/or human well-being, and is often a result of human activity.", "A non-native organism that spreads rapidly through an area, posing a significant threat to local ecosystems, agriculture, and horticulture, and has the potential to outcompete native species for resources and habitats.", "A non-native species that has successfully established a population in a new region, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering the ecosystem's balance, threatening to cause significant economic, environmental, or social harm."], "population dynamics": ["The study of changes in the distribution, abundance, and vital rates of a species within a particular area over time, taking into account the interactions between individuals and their environment.", "The intricate interplay between the number, distribution, and behavior of individuals within a specific group or community, driven by interactions between the environment, ecological processes, and the actions of predators and prey, ultimately influencing the overall structure and composition of the community over time.", "The study of how the abundance, distribution, and diversity of a particular organism change over time and space, often influenced by interactions with its environment and other species, with the goal of understanding the mechanisms that shape the ecology and management of the organism."], "mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1": ["A specific gene sequence found in the energy-producing centers of a cell, used as a genetic marker to identify and distinguish between different species of large slugs.", "A crucial component of the energy-producing machinery within cells, responsible for facilitating the efficient breakdown of nutrients to generate energy for cellular processes, with specific variants serving as unique genetic identifiers.", "A specific gene that plays a crucial role in the energy-producing process within the cells of certain organisms, serving as a molecular marker for the identification and analysis of the DNA of large slug species in the gut contents of predators."], "gut contents": ["The material, typically undigested and sometimes intact, that is present in the internal cavity of an animal after it has consumed something.", "The internal bodily material that an animal has consumed and digested, used to study the diet and nutritional intake of the animal.", "The biological matter found within the inner cavity of an insect's digestive system, obtained by analysis of its internal tissues, that provides insight into its dietary habits and nutritional sources."], "predation rate": ["The proportion of a particular species that is consumed by a predator species over a given period of time, as measured by the detection of the prey's DNA in the predator's gut contents.", "The proportion of a specific prey population consumed by a predator group within a given time period, measured by the percentage of predators that test positive for the prey's DNA.", "The proportion of a prey species found in the diet of a predator that is inversely related to the density of the prey species in the environment, as measured through the detection of specific DNA markers in the predator's digestive tract."], "slug species": ["A type of mollusk that is capable of being consumed and DNA from which can be detected in the gut contents of certain insect predators.", "A type of terrestrial mollusk characterized by a slender, elongated body without a shell or with a very fragile, externalized, and often fragmented protective structure, which is consumed by certain insects and is an important food source for these predators.", "A specific type of terrestrial mollusk, commonly found in gardens and fields, characterized by its slimy trail and lack of protective shell, with several species serving as prey for certain insects in the context of invasive species management."], "predator-prey relationship": ["A specific ecological interaction in which a certain organism plays a critical role in the population dynamics of another, often invasive, species, through the consumption of its body parts or remains, and the abundance of this predator can significantly impact the numbers and spread of the targeted species in a given environment.", "The symbiotic interaction between an organism that consumes another, non-consumed organism, and the latter, where the former's survival and reproduction depend on the successful capture and digestion of the latter, and the latter's population dynamics are influenced by the degree of consumption and density of the former.", "The reciprocal interaction between two organisms, where one is a consumer that captures and consumes the other, which is a source of food and nutrients, often influencing the populations and distribution of both species."], "biological control": ["The intentional manipulation of natural interactions within an ecosystem to manage the populations of non-native, invasive species that threaten the balance and sustainability of the environment, often achieved through the exploitation of native predators that demonstrate a capacity to
