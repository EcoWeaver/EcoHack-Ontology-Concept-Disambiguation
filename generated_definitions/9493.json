its geographic range."], "locus": ["A specific location within the DNA of an organism where a certain characteristic, such as genetic variation, can be identified and measured.", "A specific site within a genome that contains a repeated sequence of DNA, exhibiting variation in the number of repetitions among individuals, which can be used as a marker to study genetic diversity.", "A specific section of DNA that contains a repeating pattern of nucleotide bases, often exhibiting a variable number of alternative versions, which can be used to identify unique genetic variations within a species."], "alleles": ["A unique variant of a specific sequence of DNA bases within a particular gene, differing from other variants by a single or multiple nucleotide substitutions, insertions, or deletions, which are inherited from one generation to the next.", "A type of genetic variation found within a species, characterized by slight differences in a DNA sequence that occur at specific locations on a chromosome, and which can be distinguished by unique repetitive patterns of nucleotides.", "A unit of genetic variation that differs from others in a population by having a unique sequence of DNA, contributing to the overall genetic distinctness and diversity of individuals within that population."], "F(IS) values": ["A measure of the extent to which genetic information is retained within a population due to the tendency of individuals with similar genetic characteristics to mate with one another, thereby reflecting the balance between genetic diversity and genetic similarity within the population.", "A measure of the probability that two randomly chosen individuals from a population will have identical alleles at a specific genetic location, reflecting the level of relatedness between individuals within the population.", "A measure of the degree to which individuals within a population are related to one another, often used to describe the level of genetic similarity or identity among individuals."], "populations": ["A grouping of genetically distinct individuals occupying a specific geographic area or habitat, often evolving independently and sharing a common gene pool.", "A group of organisms that occupy a particular geographic area and exhibit genetic differences as a result of their shared ancestry and evolutionary history.", "A group
