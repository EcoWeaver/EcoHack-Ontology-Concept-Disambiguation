invasive mosquito species.", "A type of invasive mosquito that inhabits rocky areas and has been known to coexist with other invasive mosquito species in specific geographic regions, with a reported appearance in a particular European country in 2010.", "A type of invasive mosquito species commonly found near coastal areas, characterized by its potential to thrive in environments with high levels of water and vegetation."], "Netherlands": ["A country in Northwestern Europe, known for its distinctive windmills, rich history, and complex network of waterways, where routine surveillance inspections are conducted at companies that import used tires to monitor for invasive mosquito species.", "A country located in Northwestern Europe, comprising 12 provinces and being part of the
