an increasing presence, widespread distribution, and potentially significant ecological and economic impacts.", "The introduction and spread of non-native plant species to a new region, resulting in adverse effects on the native ecosystem, where the species reproduces, spreads, and persists without being controlled by natural predators, diseases, or other environmental factors."], "alien

through human introduction or accidental dispersal.", "A non-native plant species that grows outside of controlled cultivation, often causing significant ecological harm and human disturbance by outcompeting native species for resources, altering ecosystems, and spreading rapidly without natural checks."], "cultivation": ["The controlled growing or maintenance of plants in a specific environment, typically for a specific purpose such as agriculture, landscaping, or horticulture, involving intentional human intervention in the plants' natural life cycle.", "A deliberate and

have become established in a new environment, thereby reducing their ecological impact and preventing further spread.", "A method of controlling the spread and impact of non-native plant species that involves intentionally introducing natural predators or other organisms that feed on or attack the invasive plants, with the goal of reducing their populations and ecological effects."], "invasive

its introduced environment.", "A non-native plant species that, when introduced into a new environment, spreads rapidly and outcompetes native species for resources, potentially causing harm to the ecosystem and its inhabitants.", "Non-native plant species that have established themselves outside of cultivation and have begun to spread beyond their original area of introduction, often causing harm to the native ecosystem and potentially displacing native species."], "national regulations": ["Legal frameworks and policy measures enacted by the government to control the spread and management
