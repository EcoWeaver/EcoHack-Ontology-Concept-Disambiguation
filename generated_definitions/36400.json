backgrounds to analyze and manage the effects of these introduced species on the environment and human societies."], "globalisation": ["The phenomenon where complex systems and networks become increasingly interconnected across the globe, leading to the facilitated exchange and sharing of knowledge, ideas, and expertise among researchers from diverse backgrounds, which in turn contributes to a shift towards collaborative and multidisciplinary research endeavors.", "The complex web of international interactions, connections, and dependencies that fosters the sharing of resources, expertise, and data across national boundaries, ultimately leading to increased collaboration and cooperation among researchers from diverse backgrounds.", "The phenomenon where scientific research is increasingly conducted across international borders, resulting in a growing number of collaborative projects and publications that involve multiple researchers from diverse disciplines and locations."], "transboundary data-sets": ["Data collected from multiple regions or territories, enabling the analysis of shared ecological patterns and trends in the study of invasive species, which in turn facilitates more comprehensive and collaborative research.", "Data collections that span national borders and facilitate international cooperation and research collaboration by sharing information on invasive species.", "A compilation of information gathered from multiple sources, regions, or jurisdictions, facilitating the integration and sharing of knowledge, data, and research findings across national borders and disciplinary boundaries."], "invasive species": ["A non-native organism whose introduction, spread, and established presence in a new region threatens the ecological balance, biodiversity, and economic stability of that area, often through exploitation of novel resources, competition with native species, or transfer of invasive traits to native organisms.", "Species whose non-native presence in a given ecosystem causes ecological harm, often introduced through human activities, and are increasingly studied and managed by international collaborations of researchers with diverse expertise.", "Species that migrate to and colonize areas beyond their natural geographic range, often outcompeting and replacing native species, and requiring management efforts to mitigate their impacts on ecosystems and human activities."], "collaborative multidisciplinary author teams": ["A group of experts from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, who share research interests and goals, and frequently work together on projects, bringing together a range of skills, knowledge, and perspectives to tackle complex scientific problems,
