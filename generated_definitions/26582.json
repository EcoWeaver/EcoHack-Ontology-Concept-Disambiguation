aquaculture farms and a strong focus on research and development of native shrimp species, with operations primarily situated along the coastline.", "A region on Mexico's Caribbean coast, known for a sparse distribution of commercial shrimp farms, compared to the more established industry in the Pacific coast's northern states, which shares a concern about the use of exotic species for aquaculture and has initiated research on domesticating native penaeid species.", "A region of coastal land in eastern Mexico, characterized by a mix of tropical and subtropical climate conditions, where the most profitable type of aquaculture, shrimp farming, has a relatively lower presence compared to other parts of the country."], "Litopenaeus vannamei": ["A species of decapod crustacean commonly farmed in Mexican aquaculture, particularly in the Pacific coast region, and recently introduced to the Yucatan Peninsula for commercial purposes.", "A species of tropical marine shrimp native to the eastern Pacific Ocean, commonly used in aquaculture and widely cultured in various countries, particularly in the northern Pacific coast of Mexico, known for its fast growth rate and high yields.", "A species of shrimp commonly used in aquaculture, originating from the Pacific coast, and frequently farmed in certain regions of Mexico, including the northern states and the Yucatan Peninsula."], "Gulf of Mexico": ["A semi-enclosed body of water, connected to the open sea, that separates the mainland of North America from a coastal plain, supporting a unique and diverse ecosystem.", "A body of warm ocean water bordering a densely populated region of North America, bounded by a narrow strip of land and separated from a larger ocean to the east.", "A body of warm, salty water along the southeastern coast of North America, situated between a prominent mountain range and a vast desert region, where the freshwater discharge from numerous rivers and bays has created a unique mix of marine life."], "penaeids": ["Marine crustaceans that belong to a large and economically important group of shrimp-like species, widely farmed and researched in various parts of the world for their delicious flavor and high demand in international markets.", "Large, decapod crustaceans commonly cultivated for food, primarily farmed in certain coastal regions of Mexico, where they are of great commercial importance, and whose native species are of interest for aquaculture development.", "Decapod crustaceans of the family that is a mainstay of the aquaculture industry in certain regions, and whose introduction into new areas has sparked concerns about the potential impact on native species."], "necrotizing hepatopancreatitis": ["A severe and often fatal condition affecting the internal organs of aquatic animals, characterized by the rapid onset of tissue decay and damage, ultimately leading to their necrosis.", "A disease characterized by the rapid and widespread death of cells and tissues in the digestive system of certain crustaceans, leading to inflammation, organ damage, and potentially fatal consequences.", "A serious disease affecting farmed marine crustaceans, characterized by the death of tissue in their digestive organs, leading to impaired function and potentially widespread mortality."], "shrimp species": ["A type of crustacean characterized by its small size, long antennae, and multiple segmental appendages, commonly farmed and consumed for its edible flesh.", "A type of crustacean belonging to the family Penaeidae, commonly farmed for food and originating from the wild populations of the Gulf of Mexico.", "Aquatic crustaceans commonly cultivated in aquatic farms for human consumption, particularly those imported from foreign regions and
