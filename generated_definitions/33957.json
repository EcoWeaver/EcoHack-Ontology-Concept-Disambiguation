nonindigenous algae populations, potentially making some areas more receptive to invasion than others."], "vegetative propagation": ["The natural process by which fragments of a plant or algal species grow into new individuals, without the need for sexual reproduction, through the formation of new roots, stems, and leaves from existing structures, allowing for rapid colonization and dispersal of the species.", "The process by which a plant or algae species reproduces and disperses through the fragmentation of its own biological material, such as leaves, stems, or roots, allowing it to spread
