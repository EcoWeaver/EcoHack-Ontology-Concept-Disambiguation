provide sustenance and energy to an organism, which is considered particularly appealing to certain species."], "kernel size": ["The measure of the edible, nutrient-rich core of a seed, playing a crucial role in attracting and satisfying the needs of a specific insect species.", "The measurement of the inner, edible, and nutrient-rich portion of a seed that provides a rewarding incentive for certain insects, which may influence their host preference and consumption behavior.", "The linear measurement of the innermost seed component, a crucial factor influencing the attractiveness and nutritional value of the seed to the invasive Leptoglossus occidentalis."], "effort": ["The extent to which a resource, in this case, cone and seed traits of three pine species, must be accessed and acquired through a combination of distance, obstacles, and other hindrances, which affects its attractiveness to the invasive seed bug.", "The quantifiable measure of the difficulty or challenge of accessing a resource or reward, determined by the physical or environmental barriers that must be overcome in order to obtain it.", "The measure of the sum total of difficulties or obstacles that must be overcome in order to access and utilize a particular resource."], "coat thickness": ["The physical barrier that insects must navigate to access the nutrients stored within a plant's reproductive structures, serving as a measurement of the difficulty or \"effort\" required to harvest those nutrients.", "The external, protective layer of a seed that requires effort to penetrate, possibly indicative of its nutritional value and suitability for a particular species.", "The measurement of the physical barrier's resistance to insect access, typically evaluated by the amount of effort or energy required to breach it, thereby affecting the likelihood of insect discovery and consumption of seeds or cones."], "benefit/cost ratio": ["A quantifiable measure of the attractiveness of a resource, calculated by dividing the amount of reward obtained by the effort required to access it, with higher values indicating a more favorable balance between the two.", "The value representing
