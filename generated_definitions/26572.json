trajectory followed, which can be influenced by factors such as habitat selection and resource competition."], "refuge use": ["The preferred locations or hiding places where an animal can retreat to,

from external factors, allowing it to rest, hide, or forage.", "The act of utilizing specific areas or features within a habitat that provide shelter, protection, or suitability for an individual's survival, growth, or reproductive activities, often characterized by a high degree of overlap between species, potentially indicating competition for these resources."], "spatial behaviour": ["The manner in which organisms occupy and move within a specific environment, encompassing the distances they travel, the routes they take, and the habitats they inhabit.", "The manner in which an organism navigates and explores its environment, including the distance it travels, frequency of movement, and selection of shelter or habitat, which can influence its ability to find resources, avoid threats,

of movement, and preferences for certain locations or habitats."], "spatial ecology": ["The scientific study of the dynamics and interactions between organisms and their environments, focusing on the movements, dispersals, and habitat uses that govern their population distributions, resource competition, and ecological replacements.", "The study of the movements, dispersal, and spatial distribution of living organisms in their environment, focusing on the interactions between species and their habitats, and the consequences of these interactions on ecological dynamics and community

use space and habitat, and how these spatial dynamics influence their ecology and interactions with other species."], "invasive species": ["A non-native species that, due to its exceptional ability to disperse and exploit resources, can outcompete and replace native species, often altering the local ecosystem's composition and dynamics, with potentially devastating consequences.", "A non-native species that exhibits greater mobility, dispersal, and adaptability, allowing it to outcompete and replace native species for resources and habitat, often leading to significant ecological and economic impacts.", "A species that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an ecosystem where it did not previously exist, and as a result, outcompetes native species for resources, space, or habitat, leading to changes in the ecosystem's composition and potentially causing harm to the environment, human health, and the economy."], "patchy resources": ["A distribution of scarce or unevenly spread sustenance or benefits, requiring adaptable foraging or utilization strategies from organisms.", "Areas with irregularly distributed and limited availability of food, shelter, and other essential resources that can be accessed and utilized by certain individuals, often leading to competition and selection of individuals with more effective foraging and exploration strategies.",
