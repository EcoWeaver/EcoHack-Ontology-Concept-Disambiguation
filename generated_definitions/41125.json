{"terrestrial": ["Species that inhabit land or areas adjacent to land, as opposed to species that live in or are associated with water bodies.", "Organisms that inhabit the land or regions closely related to it, and are not aquatic or aerial.", "Organisms that live on land or in freshwater environments within a country's borders, distinct from those found in marine or coastal areas."], "freshwater": ["A region where precipitation, run-off, and natural groundwater flows into bodies of water that do not directly connect with the open ocean, characterized by a limited or absent salt concentration and a distinct ecosystem adapted to these conditions.", "A type of aquatic ecosystem characterized by having a minimal concentration of salts and other dissolved minerals, typically supporting a unique array of plants and animals adapted to this specific environment.", "The habitat of bodies of water that are not directly connected to the ocean, characterized by a consistent supply of water from precipitation, aquifers, or surface run-off, and supporting a diverse range of plant and animal species adapted to living in these environments."], "invertebrates": ["Organisms that lack a backbone or internal skeleton, commonly found on land or in freshwater environments.", "Animals without backbones or vertebrate skeletons that are found on land or in freshwater environments.", "Organisms without backbones that are not fish, reptiles, amphibians, or mammals, but may still be animals, including, for example, creatures with segmented bodies, exoskeletons, or many legs."], "species": ["A biological classification that refers to a group of living organisms that share distinct characteristics, such as physical traits, behaviors, or physiological features, which differentiate them from other groups, and are typically used to identify and categorize the diversity of life on Earth.", "A grouping of organisms that exhibit shared characteristics, resulting from a unique evolutionary history, and are distinguishable from others of the same general type, often in terms of physical traits, habits, or genetic markers, thus providing a distinct category for classification and study.", "A naturally occurring grouping of distinct organisms, often bound together by shared physical characteristics, genetic makeup, or evolutionary history, which can be distinguished from other similar groupings."], "alien species": ["Organisms not native to a region, introduced by natural or human-mediated means, that can thrive and potentially establish populations, and which may have impacts on the ecosystem's balance and biodiversity.", "Organisms that are not native to a specific geographic region and have been introduced, either intentionally or unintentionally, through human activity or natural means, resulting in establishment of a viable population outside their natural range.", "Species that are introduced, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a region or ecosystem outside their native range, and whose presence is considered non-native, invasive, or an introduced population."], "plants": ["The multicellular, photosynthetic organisms that produce their own food through a process involving sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, often found in terrestrial or freshwater environments.", "Organisms that are multicellular, photosynthetic, and typically rooted in the soil, playing a crucial role in supporting ecosystems through their roles as producers and providers of habitat and shelter.", "Organisms characterized by photosynthetic processes and reproductive structures that produce seeds, spores, or other reproductive structures, often found in terrestrial or aquatic environments."], "birds": ["A group of warm-blooded, egg-laying vertebrates characterized by feathers, toothless beaks, and lightweight skeletons, often found inhabiting aerial environments and comprising species with various plumage patterns, sizes, and migratory behaviors.", "Organisms that are warm-blooded, feathered, egg-laying, vertebrates that possess lungs, and are primarily defined by their ability to fly.", "Species that are typically characterized by feathers, toothless beaks, and the ability to fly, but do not necessarily possess these traits universally, and are often found in terrestrial or aquatic environments."], "mammals": ["Warm-blooded animals with hair, three middle ear bones, and mammary glands that produce milk for their young, typically living on land and feeding on a variety of food sources, ranging from insects to plants.", "Warm-blooded, vertebrate animals that possess hair or fur, produce milk for their young, and give birth to live young rather than laying eggs, often characterized by their ability to suckle their young and possess mammary glands.", "Warm-blooded, hair-bearing, lactating vertebrates that are typically larger than birds and reptiles, having mammary glands, a neocortex, and endothermic metabolism."], "reptiles": ["Cold-blooded, scaly creatures that live on land and breathe air, ranging from small lizards to larger serpents, including some that are native to deserts and dry environments.", "Scaly-skinned, cold-blooded vertebrates that inhabit aquatic and terrestrial environments, characterized by the ability to shed skin periodically and regulate body temperature externally.", "Warm-blooded creatures that do not have the ability to lay eggs externally, characterized by scaly skin and typically being ectothermic, and consisting of a variety of species such as lizards, snakes, and turtles that have been recorded in the United Arab Emirates."], "amphibian": ["Cold-blooded vertebrates that have a life cycle that involves both aquatic and terrestrial environments, typically starting in water and moving to land as adults.", "A group of animals that possess characteristics of both reptiles and fish, and are typically found in moist environments, with smooth, moist skin and a life cycle that involves both aquatic and terrestrial phases.", "Cold-blooded animals that spend a significant portion of their life cycle in or around water, but also breathe air and have a moist, smooth skin, which often undergoes a transformation from a larval stage to a adult form."], "fish": ["Organisms that are aquatic, cold-blooded, and breathe using gills, typically living in or near water and characterized by their scales, fins, and ability to produce eggs.", "A type of cold-blooded, scale-covered, finned aquatic animal that is often introduced to freshwater environments, and is a major group of organisms that can be identified in studies of biological invasions.", "A type of aquatic animal with a backbone, often found in freshwater bodies, characterized by its ability to breathe with gills and typically having scales or fins, which can be non-native to a specific region and therefore considered an \"alien\" species."]}
