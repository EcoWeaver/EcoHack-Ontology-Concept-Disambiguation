{"native plants": ["Plants that have evolved in a particular geographic region and have adapted to its specific climate, soil, and environmental conditions, making them better suited to thrive in that region without human intervention or supplementation.", "Plants that originated and evolved in a specific region, adapted to its local climate, soil, and ecosystems, and can thrive independently without the need for significant external resources or maintenance, thereby offering benefits such as sustainability, biodiversity, and reduced environmental impact.", "Plants that are naturally occurring in a particular region or ecosystem, without human introduction or cultivation, and are often specifically adapted to the local climate, soil, and other environmental conditions."], "green roofs": ["A type of built environment modification that involves placing vegetation and/or plant materials on top of or integrated into structures, often as a means to enhance aesthetic appeal, provide environmental benefits, and mitigate urban sprawl, while also requiring specific design and maintenance considerations to ensure the well-being of the installed plants.", "A built environment feature characterized by a vegetation-covered surface that is elevated above the ground, providing a distinct ecosystem that combines urban architecture with natural vegetation to create a unique microclimate.", "A layer of vegetation or planted area situated on top of buildings or structures, often used to mitigate environmental effects, enhance aesthetics, and provide additional benefits."], "ground-level landscaping": ["The manipulation of terrestrial vegetation and hardscapes for aesthetic, functional, or ecological purposes, typically occurring in areas contiguous to the built environment, where human activities and natural processes interact.", "Design and installation of vegetation and landscapes in areas at or near the level of the ground, where environmental conditions are typical of those experienced by plants in natural ecosystems, often aiming to promote ecological diversity, aesthetic appeal, and functional benefits.", "Landscaping that takes place in areas with established soil and a conventional climate, where plants can absorb water, nutrients, and sunlight from the surrounding environment through traditional mechanisms, often used as a reference point for designing and planning urban spaces."], "rooftop environment": ["An artificial, vertical habitat characterized by limited soil depth, extreme temperature fluctuations, and distinct microclimatic conditions that require unique adaptations to support plant growth and biodiversity, distinguished from traditional ground-level environments by its inherent lack of geological complexity, altered solar radiation, and reduced water availability.", "A distinct ecological niche characterized by unique conditions of temperature, humidity, wind, and sunlight that differ from those found in the surrounding urban landscape, often influencing the behavior and adaptation of plant species.", "The specific combination of microclimatic conditions, solar radiation, wind patterns, and substrate characteristics that result from a flat or sloping surface elevated several meters above the surrounding terrain, distinct from its ground-level counterpart and influencing the selection of plant species for rooftop horticulture."], "architects": ["Designers responsible for creating structures that integrate buildings with the surrounding environment, often combining artistic vision with practical considerations.", "Professionals who design and plan the visual and functional aspects of buildings, cities, and spaces, often considering factors such as aesthetics, functionality, and sustainability.", "Professionals who design and plan the external features of buildings, structures, and public spaces, including the selection of plants and materials used in landscaping."], "landscape architects": ["Professionals who design and plan outdoor spaces, integrating ecological and aesthetic considerations, often focusing on sustainable and environmentally conscious approaches.", "Professionals who design and plan outdoor spaces, taking into account both their functional and aesthetic aspects, and who often consider the environmental impact of their creations, in order to create spaces that are both beautiful and sustainable.", "Professionals who design and plan outdoor spaces, combining artistic and technical skills to create functional and aesthetically pleasing environments that interact with natural ecosystems."], "biologists": ["Professionals specializing in the study of living organisms and ecosystems, often focusing on conservation, ecology, and environmental management, who contribute to the development and implementation of sustainable practices in built environments.", "Professionals whose work involves the scientific study of living organisms, ecological systems, and natural environments, often influencing design decisions and recommendations for human-made structures.", "Professionals who study the natural world and its diverse components, with a focus on understanding the intricate relationships within ecosystems, often advocating for sustainable practices that respect the delicate balance of the environment."], "engineers": ["Professionals whose work focuses on the application of mathematical and scientific principles to design, build, and maintain practical solutions to real-world problems.", "Professionals who specialize in the practical application of scientific and technological principles to design, construct, and maintain structures and systems, often prioritizing functionality and feasibility over aesthetic considerations.", "Specialists in creating and optimizing systems, processes, and structures, often with a focus on practicality, functionality, and technical feasibility, who tend to prioritize specific design criteria and environmental factors that may not necessarily prioritize aesthetics or conservation efforts."]}
