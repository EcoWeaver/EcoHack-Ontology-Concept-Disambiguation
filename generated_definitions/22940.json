balance and integrity of that environment.", "Non-native organisms that, once established in an ecosystem, displace native species or alter their environment, often causing ecological harm or economic disruption, requiring management and control measures to mitigate their impact.", "A non-native organism that, when introduced to a new environment, rapidly colonizes and spreads, potentially outcompeting native species and altering the ecosystem's structure and function, often with significant ecological and economic consequences."], "Cecropia": ["A Neotropical tree species that has been introduced to West Java, representing a considerable invasion risk to natural ecosystems, with sufficient evidence to warrant concern, but whose taxonomy is not yet well enough understood to determine

dynamics over time.", "The likelihood of a non-native species' successful establishment, proliferation, and potential harm to native ecosystems, which can occur as a result of human activities or natural processes, and poses a significant threat to the native flora and fauna."], "natural ecosystems": ["Self-sustaining systems of native plants, animals, and microorganisms that interact with each other and their environment in a specific manner, shaped by geological, climatic, and evolutionary processes over time.", "The complex networks of interactions between native species, habitats,

characterized by complex interactions between indigenous species and their native habitats, with a self-sustaining structure and function that are shaped by long-term evolutionary processes, and where human influences are generally minimal or incidental."], "control options": ["Methods or actions that are employed to manage, mitigate, or eliminate the adverse ecological impacts caused by the presence and spread of a non-native species, with the ultimate goal of preserving the integrity and resilience of affected natural ecosystems.", "Techniques or methods designed to mitigate or

mitigate the undesirable impact of a species, in this context, the invasive Cecropia, on the environment and native ecosystems."], "developing countries": ["Regions where economic and infrastructure development has historically been hindered by a combination of geographical, political, and socio-cultural factors, resulting in limited resources, infrastructure, and capacity for invasive species management and ecological research.", "Regions characterized by limited economic resources, institutional capacity, and infrastructure, where environmental management and conservation efforts are hindered by various constraints, making them particularly vulnerable to the impacts of invasive alien species.", "Economies or regions characterized by limited resources, infrastructure, and

outcompeting or displacing indigenous species.", "A non-native organism that, by its presence in a foreign environment, poses a significant threat to the integrity of local ecosystems, often displacing native species and altering ecosystem processes.", "A non-native species whose presence in a new environment is capable of causing significant harm to the natural balance of that ecosystem, despite being present in small numbers and potentially being beneficial in its original habitat."]}
