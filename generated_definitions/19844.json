higher establishment success when co-occurring with these native species.", "A type of reptile commonly found on islands and continents, characterized by a higher likelihood of successful establishment when native relatives are present, and whose species-specific outcome varies by group (with lizards showing the highest establishment success in the presence of native congeners)."],

contributes to the establishment success of non-native reptiles on a global scale.", "A type of legless, cold-blooded vertebrate that, when present alongside other species similar to it, tends to aid

difference in establishment success when introduced to a new environment, compared to other reptiles in the same category.", "A type of reptile that, in the context of the study, is categorized as one
