introduced to new areas through human activity and subsequently causing ecological disturbances."], "intertidal waters": ["The zone between the highest and lowest tide marks where marine organisms, such as mussels, can tolerate fluctuations in water level and exposure to air, requiring adaptations to survive in a dynamic environment where water chemistry and temperature conditions are constantly changing.", "The zone where the sea meets the land, where tidal forces alternate between exposure to air and immersion in seawater, and where marine organisms adapted to these fluctuations can be found.", "The zone where the ocean meets the land, characterized by a constantly shifting environment subject to tidal fluctuations, and where marine species adapted to live in this dynamic setting are found."], "shallow waters": ["The portion of a body of water where the water is not very deep, typically accessible to humans on foot or with minimal boat travel, and inhabited by aquatic organisms adapted to such conditions, often characterized by sediment, aquatic plants, and limited water flow.", "Areas where the water is only moderately deep, permitting exposure to the atmosphere at high tide and facilitating the growth of certain marine organisms.", "A region of aquatic environment with water levels and currents that permit the coexistence of marine species typical of intertidal zones and species adapted to freshwater habitats, characterized by a relatively stable and predictable environment, facilitating the establishment of introduced species."], "Nervion estuary": ["A partially enclosed body of saltwater, located in the southwestern region of the Bay of Biscay, where freshwater from a nearby river mixes with the sea, creating a unique environment that

its importance as a habitat for various marine species.", "A coastal body of water, located in the southern part of the Bay of Biscay, where freshwater from a nearby river meets the ocean, creating a unique ecosystem with a mixture of fresh and saltwater conditions, and serving as a habitat for a variety of aquatic species."], "Bay of Biscay": ["A semi-enclosed body of water located in the northeastern part of the Atlantic Ocean, bounded by the western coast of Europe and the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, which is a significant pathway for the introduction of non-native

crucial role in the region's ecosystem and maritime activities."], "invasion": ["The introduction of a non-native species into a new environment, typically through human activities, resulting in the establishment of a population that outcompetes or displaces native species, potentially causing significant ecological, economic, and social impacts.", "The deliberate or unintentional introduction and establishment of a non-native species in a previously uninhabited or native-species-dominated area, which can have significant ecological, economic, and social consequences.", "The process by which a non-native species, typically originating from a distinct environmental or geographic region, gains entry into and establishes a self-sustaining population within a new area, often through human activity, and subsequently begins to displace native species and alter the ecosystem's natural balance."], "vectors of introduction and dispersal": ["The mechanisms and pathways by which a non-native species is introduced and spread to a new area, including the actions or actions of humans and environmental factors that facilitate the transfer of the species from one location to
