{"ecosystem function": ["The intrinsic properties and processes that govern the ability of a community to maintain its stability, resilience, and overall condition, thereby determining its ability to resist or adapt to changes in species composition, such as the colonization of exotic species.", "The complex interplay of resident species that moderates the propensity of novel, non-native species to colonize and thrive within a community, thereby influencing the integrity and resilience of the community's natural dynamics.", "The capacity of a biological community to resist and respond to changes, including the establishment and growth of non-native species, through the collective actions and interactions of its constituent organisms and their environments."], "species loss": ["The removal or extinction of certain types of organisms that were previously present in an ecosystem, resulting in a decline in the overall number and variety of species within that ecosystem, and potentially altering the balance of its functioning and dynamics.", "The decline or elimination of unique characteristics or properties within a community, leading to a decrease in the variety of coexisting entities that contribute to the overall functioning and resilience of the ecosystem.", "The removal or decline of specific elements within an ecosystem, resulting in a diminished variety of these elements, which can ultimately alter the community's ability to resist colonization by non-native organisms."], "invasion resistance": ["The capacity of an ecosystem to successfully resist and exclude non-native species from establishing themselves within its boundaries, thereby maintaining its native balance and composition.", "The ability of an ecosystem to prevent or reduce the establishment and spread of non-native species, which is influenced by the presence and diversity of native species, particularly those that are less abundant.", "The ability of an ecosystem to resist the establishment and proliferation of non-native species, thereby maintaining its native composition and functioning."], "resident diversity": ["The collective presence and variety of non-dominant species within an ecological community, which play a significant role in shaping the community's resistance to external changes and influence its overall stability and resilience.", "The variety and abundance of native species present in an ecosystem, which can play a crucial role in determining the resistance to colonization by non-native species.", "The variety and abundance of organisms within a community that are native to the ecosystem and play a role in shaping its structure and function, typically including species that are less prominent in terms of abundance or biomass."], "community resistance": ["The capacity of an ecosystem to successfully defend against or prevent the establishment and spread of non-native species through a balance of diverse native species interactions and functional roles.", "The ability of an ecosystem to withstand and effectively manage the colonization and establishment of non-native species, thereby maintaining its characteristic composition, structure, and function.", "The ability of an ecosystem to resist changes in its composition and function caused by the introduction of non-native species, which is facilitated by the presence of a diverse community of species that exert influences on the environment and the species that are being introduced."], "exotic species": ["A non-native organism that colonizes a new geographic area, often with potential impacts on the ecosystem's native species and functioning, introduced by human activity or natural processes, such as wind or water dispersal.", "Non-native organisms that are introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, and can potentially alter its native balance and functioning.", "A non-native species that is intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an ecosystem, thereby potentially altering its ecological balance and natural dynamics."], "species diversity": ["The array of distinct components that coexist within a system, characterized by their variability in abundance and the presence of numerous different entities, which, together, contribute to the overall complexity and resilience of the system.", "The variety and abundance of distinct forms of life within an ecological community, where the presence of lesser-known or less abundant elements contributes to the overall resilience and stability of the community.", "The presence and variability of different organisms in an ecosystem, as measured by the number of distinct types and the relative abundance of each, which can have a significant impact on the ability of the ecosystem to resist colonization by non-native species."], "invasion events": ["The process by which a non-native species becomes established and dominates a previously intact ecosystem, potentially altering its native biodiversity and functioning.", "The process by which non-native organisms establish themselves and thrive in an ecosystem previously unoccupied by their kind, thereby altering its natural balance and potentially leading to long-term changes to its structure and function.", "The process by which a non-native species successfully establishes and spreads within an ecosystem, disrupting the balance and dynamics of the native community."]}
