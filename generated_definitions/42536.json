{"INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES": ["A non-native species that has entered a new region or ecosystem and can cause harm to the environment, economy, or human health through its population growth, competition for resources, and potential spread to other areas.", "A type of non-native organism, previously found nowhere in a region or ecosystem, which has deliberately or accidentally been introduced and now threatens to displace or harm the indigenous species by competing for resources, spreading disease, or altering its environment, potentially causing significant economic, environmental, and ecological harm.", "A non-native species that is not typically found in a region, which has entered an ecosystem through human activity or natural means and is capable of outcompeting and displacing native species, potentially causing ecological and economic harm."], "SPIONID POLYCHAETES": ["A type of marine invertebrate worm that belongs to a family of polychaetes characterized by the presence of bristles (chaetae) on their body, which are specialized for movement and sensing the environment, and are often associated with the larvae of other marine species.", "A type of marine invertebrate that belongs to a group of segmented worms characterized by their ability to construct complex burrows in sedimentary environments and often exhibit a distinctive, feather-like set of appendages for feeding and locomotion.", "A type of segmented worm with bristle-covered bodies, typically found in marine environments, and known for their ability to bore into and inhabit shells and other calcareous substrates."], "BLACK SEA": ["A semi-enclosed inland body of water located between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, connected to the Mediterranean Sea by the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, and known for being the second-largest sea in Europe, with a significant impact on regional climate, ecology, and human settlements.", "A semi-enclosed inland body of saltwater, bordered by two countries and extending into a region known for its historical and cultural significance, with a coastal area that has recently become home to invasive alien species.", "A body of water in southeastern Europe, connecting to the Mediterranean Sea, bounded by Turkey and Bulgaria, and featuring a coastline with a complex history of human settlement and international conflict."], "COAST": ["The linear or continuous edge or margin of a larger area of water, where the influence of oceanic or sea currents, tides, and wave action meet the land.", "The boundary between the landmass and the marine ecosystem, where human settlements and commercial activities often intersect with the constant and cyclical movements of tidal waters and sediment transport, creating a unique environment where species from both realms can converge and coexist.", "The zone of transition between the land and the water, where the continental shelf merges with the open ocean, marked by the intersection of sedimentary deposits, tidal currents, and ecological changes that support a unique assemblage of organisms."], "ABKHAZIA": ["A peninsula in the Western Caucasus, located on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, known for its coastal regions hosting a variety of marine biodiversity, including newly discovered invasive alien species.", "A mountainous region along the eastern coast of the Black Sea, known for its rich biodiversity and historical importance, where the border of two major geographic and political entities meets.", "A southern coastal region of a major body of water in western Eurasia, known for its historical cultural and linguistic distinctiveness and its location along the shoreline of a significant sea."], "SUKHUM BAY": ["A picturesque and historically significant coastal area located along the eastern shoreline of a major body of saltwater, known for its tranquil beaches and ancient cultural heritage, where a newly discovered non-native species of marine invertebrates was observed.", "A significant body of water located on the southeastern coast of a peninsula in the western part of the Black Sea, known for being a common area where aquatic organisms from other regions first appear in the local ecosystem.", "A coastal region in the Black Sea, home to a specific location of marine biodiversity significance where a new record of invasive alien species has been documented."], "SPECIES DISTRIBUTION": ["The identification and mapping of distinct biological entities, occurring naturally within a specific geographical area or region, as documented and recorded through scientific observations and research.", "The pattern or range of a distinct biological entity's geographic presence across the world, indicating where it can be found, where it has been recorded, and potentially where it may not exist or has gone extinct.", "The territorial range or scope within which a specific biological entity, characterized by a unique set of traits or characteristics, is naturally found and occurs in a particular environment."]}
