stagnation is influenced by environmental factors, characterized by a boundary that defines its edge or border of influence.", "The descriptive representation of the distribution and growth pattern of a population of organisms, plants, or other biological entities as it spreads and adapts to its environment over time, often exhibiting a boundary that marks the advancing edge of its expansion."], "space dimensions": ["The fundamental characteristic that determines the complexity and structure of a phenomenon's distribution or pattern in a multi-faceted framework.", "The number of independent ways to vary the position of an object in a three-dimensional geometric structure, which determines the number of coordinates required to specify its location.", "The characteristic by which a multidimensional structure's extent, breadth, and depth can be quantified, influencing the behavior of diffusive logistic equations with free boundaries."], "symmetry": ["The condition where all points, lines, or shapes in a given scenario or system remain equivalent in structure, pattern, or behavior, regardless of the direction or axis of observation, as if reflected across a theoretical mirror line, ensuring that any transformations or changes applied to one side of the system result in a corresponding transformation or change on the other side.", "The state of being equal in all respects, with no distinction or difference in characteristics or features, resulting in a situation where an object or phenomenon exhibits the same properties or behaviors from all directions or perspectives, often used to simplify complex analyses and models by reducing them to a single, representative aspect or dimension.", "The state of being unaltered by rotation or reflection, where any given point or pattern maintains its shape, size, and position regardless of the orientation or mirror image of the reference frame."], "space dimension": ["The number of variables required to describe the physical location of a phenomenon, measured from a fixed origin, in a way that determines the distances and angles between different points in the phenomenon's distribution.", "The extent to which an object or concept exists independently, with no inherent connection to its surroundings, as measured by the number of independent directions it can grow or evolve.", "The quantity that characterizes the number of independent coordinates required to specify the location of a point in a mathematical space, which can affect the behavior and dynamics of certain phenomena, such as the spread of species, modeled through equations like the diffusive logistic equation with a free boundary."], "homogeneous environment": ["An environment characterized by uniform conditions throughout, where the properties and characteristics remain constant across all spatial dimensions, unaffected by distance from the center, and are not modified by the introduction of an expanding species.", "An environment in which the influence of external factors on the spread of a species or the growth of a population is uniformly distributed and equally impactful across all regions, without being modified by any geographical or spatial boundaries.", "An environment where the factors that affect the growth or spread of a species do not change in intensity or magnitude as you move further away from a central point, resulting in uniform conditions that support the same type of behavior in all areas."], "spreading-vanishing dichotomy": ["The phenomenon where a population's growth and expansion either eventually lead to the complete eradication of the species, or continue indefinitely, characterized by a sharp boundary that marks the leading edge of the population's expansion, which determines the ultimate fate of the species.", "The phenomenon where a population's dynamics eventually lead to either the complete extinction of the species or the continuous expansion of its range, with no intermediate states or stable coexistence, in a manner that is independent of the spatial dimension.", "The phenomenon where a model predicting the expansion of a species or quantity exhibits two distinct outcomes: either the expansion accelerates indefinitely, reaching far-reaching proportions, or it ultimately succumbs to environmental pressures, disappearing or dwindling to insignificance."], "spreading speed": ["The rate at which the boundary of a self-sustaining biological phenomenon or process advances, driven by environmental conditions and characterized by the asymptotic limit it approaches as it expands into a heterogeneous or uniform space, representing the pace at which the phenomenon grows or colonizes its surroundings.", "The rate at which the boundary of an invasive species' expansion approaches the edge of the habitat, measured by the ratio of the distance traveled by the edge to the time elapsed, in the absence of external influences or obstructions.", "The rate at which a species, such as a new or invasive one, expands its geographical range, measured by the distance it covers over a given period of time, as it occupies and

territory, marking the initial point of expansion and the outermost edge of its presence.", "The boundary of a species' invasive territory where its presence marks a distinct transition from a state of scarcity to one of abundance, serving as a indicator of the species' capacity to spread or decline in the given environment.", "The boundary beyond which a population or species' influence extends, where the rate of growth or spread is most pronounced, and serves as a delimiter between areas where the species is dominant and where it is nonexistent."]}
