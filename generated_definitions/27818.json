communities."], "invasive species": ["A plant species that has been introduced outside its natural range and can cause ecological or economic harm by displacing native species, altering ecosystem processes, or altering native communities through changes in species composition or population dynamics, often exhibiting a strong tendency to spread rapidly and establish populations in areas where it is not native.", "A type of non-native organism that has established a reproducing population in an ecosystem, and its presence is often characterized by a significant impact on the native biota, often resulting in modifications to the ecosystem's composition, structure, and functioning.", "A plant that is introduced to an ecosystem outside of its natural range and grows unchecked, potentially outcompeting native species for resources, altering the environment, and causing long-term changes to the ecosystem's structure and function, often with devastating consequences for the native biota."], "putative outcomes": ["The predicted and anticipated consequences of a specific environmental factor, such as the presence of an invasive species, that are expected to occur based on theoretical assumptions or previous research, but whose actual occurrence has not been definitively proven or documented.", "The hypothetical or assumed effects of an invasive species' presence on a
