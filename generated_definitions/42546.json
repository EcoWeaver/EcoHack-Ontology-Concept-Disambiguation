displacing native species and altering ecosystems through their introduction of novel pathogens, competitors, or predators.", "The process by which non-native species, often introduced by human activity, establish themselves in an area inhabited by native species, potentially disrupting the balance of the ecosystem and threatening the survival of native populations.", "The phenomenon where non-native species, often introduced through human activities, establish self-sustaining populations in an ecosystem, potentially disrupting the existing balance and potentially exposing native species to new pathogens and diseases."], "native species": ["Organisms that inhabit an ecosystem prior to the introduction of non-native species, and whose population dynamics and ecological niches are not significantly altered by the presence of these invasive species.", "Species that originated in a region or ecosystem, but have not been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans,

populations are typically unaffected by the presence of invasive species, unless there is direct contact or competition for resources."], "pathogens": ["Small infectious microorganisms that can be transmitted from one species to another, causing disease or impairment in the affected organisms.", "Microorganisms that can cause disease in host organisms, often as a result of transmission from one species to another, and can have significant impacts on the ecological balance and biodiversity of affected ecosystems.", "Organisms or agents capable of causing disease or harm to native species, potentially through contact or interaction with invasive populations or environments."], "bird species": ["A group of individuals belonging to the same class of warm-blooded, egg-laying, feathered vertebrates that share a set of characteristics that distinguish them from other related groups, often recognized by unique physical and behavioral features.", "A distinct population of organisms of a specific taxonomic rank, characterized by a unique set of physical and behavioral attributes, which inhabits a specific geographic area and exhibits genetic and reproductive isolation from other such populations.", "A type of animal that belongs to a group characterized by wings, beaks, and feathers, typically inhabiting the earth's terrestrial and aerial environments, and exhibiting unique characteristics and traits distinct from other organisms."], "invasive populations": ["A grouping of non-native birds that have been introduced to a new environment and are now found in a region where they did not previously exist, potentially threatening the ecology and populations of native species that cohabit with them.", "A group of non-native animals that have established themselves in a new environment, often outcompeting native species for resources and potentially threatening local ecosystems.", "A group of non-native organisms that thrive and spread rapidly in a specific ecosystem, often displacing native species and causing ecological and biological disruptions."], "psittacine beak and feather disease virus": ["A type of bird pathogen that causes disease characterized by defects in the beak and feathers of its hosts, and is commonly found in parrot species.", "A type of virus that affects the respiratory and circulatory systems of certain birds, leading to disease symptoms such as beak deformation, feather loss, and increased mortality, and is typically associated with the introduction of invasive bird species into new ecosystems.", "A DNA virus that affects the respiratory and digestive systems of certain birds, causing a range of symptoms including beak deformation, feather loss, and respiratory distress, and is transmitted primarily among members of the same species or through close contact between birds."], "circoviruses": ["A type of tiny, ring-shaped genetic material that infects birds, causing diseases characterized by damage to their beaks and feathers, and can also be present in birds without causing symptoms.", "A type of virus that is known to infect certain bird species and is often associated with diseases that affect their beaks and feathers.", "A type of virus that targets the cells of birds, particularly affecting their beaks and feathers, and is often found in specific species of parakeets, posing a risk of transmission to other bird populations."], "disease": ["A detrimental condition characterized by an impairment in the normal physiological functions of an organism, often accompanied by observable signs or symptoms, and typically caused by the presence of a foreign entity, such as a pathogen.", "A pathological condition characterized by changes to the structure and function of an organism, triggered by the presence of a microorganism or virus, which can manifest through visible signs or symptoms and potentially disrupt the well-being and survival of the affected species.", "A condition characterized by symptoms or signs of impaired biological function or altered physiological processes, which can manifest in a variety of ways, such as altered behavior, physical deformities, or increased mortality, and can be caused by various factors including infectious agents, environmental factors, or genetic defects."], "BFDV genotype": ["A specific strain or variation of a viral species that is distinguished from other strains within the same species by its genetic makeup and can influence the transmission and virulence of the virus.", "A specific variation of a virus that affects parakeet species, known for being present in a certain type of invasive parakeet and previously detected in a particular location, which is being studied for its potential transmission to native bird species.", "A specific genetic variation of a virus that infects birds, particularly psittacine birds, which is characterized by a distinct genetic makeup or sequence that sets it apart from other similar viruses."], "sympatric invasive parakeets": ["Wild populations of a non-native bird species that coexist with native bird species in the same geographic area, potentially sharing their habitat and potentially transmitting pathogens to the native species.", "A population of non-native birds of a specific species that have successfully established themselves in a new environment and are living alongside native bird species, potentially carrying and transmitting diseases that could impact the native bird population.", "Populations of non-native birds, specifically certain parrot species, living alongside and interacting with native bird species in the same geographical area, which raises concerns about the potential transmission of diseases between the two groups."], "native birds": ["Organisms that have always been present in a particular region or ecosystem, often without human introduction or significant human impact, and are typically an integral part of the native ecosystem's biodiversity.", "Species of birds that naturally inhabit and coexist with the environment in a specific geographic area, without having been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by human activity.", "Species of birds that coexist in an ecosystem with non-native, introduced species, which they do not share a natural geographical range with, and whose populations have not undergone evolutionary changes to adapt to the presence of these introduced species."]}
