assemblage of ant species, some of which are exotic and others that are endemic to this unique habitat.", "A southeastern US region characterized by a historically extensive grassland habitat that has

["A southeastern US region notable for its share of the once-widespread, now-threatened black belt prairie, a habitat type that has been largely destroyed in the past two centuries.", "A region in the southeastern United States where the remnants of a once extensive grassland ecosystem, known as the Black Belt Prairie, are situated.", "A southeastern US region formerly comprising vast areas of prairie, which has largely been destroyed, but still holds remnants of its ant fauna significance."], "grasslands": ["Open, temperate, and predominantly herbaceous ecosystems that historically covered extensive areas of the southeastern United States, characterized by a lack of tree cover and dominated by grasses and wildflowers.", "A type of natural ecosystem characterized by open spaces dominated by grasses, where a unique assemblage of flora and fauna have evolved in harmony, vulnerable to loss due to human activities.", "A type of terrestrial ecosystem characterized by the dominance of grasses and other herbaceous vegetation, often with scattered trees, and frequently subject to human activities leading to habitat degradation and loss."], "endangered habitat type": ["A type of natural environment that has declined significantly in extent and remains vulnerable to destruction or degradation, often requiring conservation efforts to preserve its unique characteristics and species diversity.", "A type of ecosystem that was once widespread, but has undergone significant reduction in extent or quality over time, resulting in a heightened risk of its permanent loss or degradation.", "A type of natural area that was once widespread, but has significantly declined in extent and quality over the past two centuries due to human activities, leaving a fragmented and threatened ecosystem that supports a unique community of species."], "subfamilies": ["A classification grouping certain closely related categories of organisms within a larger classification rank, often used to further categorize and distinguish smaller subgroups within a family.", "A hierarchical classification category that groups species within the same genus into related yet distinct taxonomic divisions, often characterized by shared physical or biological characteristics.", "A hierarchical grouping of a taxonomic group within a larger taxonomic category, typically denoting a closer relationship among species or genera within a specific lineage, and often reflecting shared characteristics or evolutionary history."], "genera": ["A term of classification that groups together closely related species that share similar characteristics, such as physical traits or habits.", "A category of organisms that ranks above species and represents a group of closely related species, characterized by a common evolutionary history and shared physical characteristics, and used to organize and identify the diversity of life.", "A group of related species that are considered to be so similar in characteristics and evolutionary history that they are treated together in classification and nomenclature."], "ant species": ["A distinct group of insects that exhibit specific characteristics in terms of morphology, behavior, and ecology, which together define a unique entity within a specific taxonomic classification.", "A type of insect that is a member of a particular genus or subfamily, characterized by social organization and a shared reproductive strategy, with various forms and characteristics that distinguish it from other insects within the same family.", "A
