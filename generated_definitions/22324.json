{"cultivated alien plant species": ["Plant species that have been intentionally introduced to a new environment through human activity and are often grown in controlled settings, such as gardens or greenhouses, prior to establishment in the wild.", "A type of non-native plant species that has been selectively bred or manipulated for desirable traits, often through human intervention, and is commonly used in ornamental or horticultural contexts.", "A species of non-native flora that has been deliberately introduced to a region through human activity, often with specific characteristics cultivated or selected for aesthetic or horticultural purposes."], "native plant species": ["Species of flora that have evolved in a specific region or ecosystem over a long period of time, have a natural adaptation to the local climate and soil conditions, and are not intentionally introduced by humans.", "Species of plants that have evolved and adapted to their environment over a long period of time without human assistance or cultivation, and are endemic to a specific geographic region.", "Plants that originated and evolved in a specific geographic region, where they have been present for thousands of years, have developed unique characteristics, and are an integral part of the native ecosystem, often playing a crucial role in its functioning and diversity."], "invasiveness": ["The phenomenon by which non-native plant species, often intentionally introduced or cultivated, successfully adapt and spread in their new environment at the expense of native species, frequently resulting in altered ecosystems and ecological disruption.", "The tendency of certain plant species, often introduced or cultivated, to rapidly spread and thrive in areas where they are not native, potentially outcompeting and disrupting the ecological balance of local flora and fauna.", "The uncontrolled spread and dominance of a non-native species in a ecosystem, often resulting in disruption to native ecological processes and potentially causing harm to native species, habitats, and human activities."], "introduction bias": ["The tendency for species with pre-adapted traits, which were favored by human cultivation and selection, to be disproportionately introduced to a new region, thus skewing the characteristics of the introduced species pool and potentially leading to false assumptions about the traits associated with invasive behavior.", "The phenomenon where the characteristics of a group of organisms, artificially favored or selected by humans, are overrepresented in a study population, potentially skewing the observed trends or differences between that group and native or natural populations.", "The tendency for species that have been intentionally introduced to an ecosystem, often through human-mediated processes such as cultivation and selection, to have characteristics that differ from those of native species, potentially leading to misinterpretation of these differences as indicators of invasiveness."], "human-mediated selection": ["The deliberate act of preferring, propagating, or cultivating specific characteristics in a species or individual to enhance its growth, reproduction, or other desirable traits, often resulting in a population with modified characteristics distinct from its wild or natural counterparts.", "The intentional or unintentional favoring of certain individuals or populations of a species that exhibit desirable traits, such as faster germination, due to deliberate human actions, habits, or choices, which can ultimately lead to the selection and propagation of these traits in subsequent generations or introductions.", "The process by which humans intentionally or unintentionally favor certain traits or characteristics in a population, often through cultivation, breeding, or transplantation, which can lead to the spread of specific traits to a larger group or region."], "cultivars": ["A type of plant variant that is specifically bred and selected for desirable traits by humans, often for ornamental purposes, and is characterized by consistent reproduction of these traits in offspring.", "Variations of a plant species that have been selectively bred and refined by humans for desirable characteristics, often with the goal of improving aesthetic appeal or agricultural productivity, and are typically propagated through controlled cultivation rather than through natural reproduction.", "A group of genetically similar plant variants that have been selectively bred by humans for desirable characteristics, such as rapid germination, improved growth, or enhanced appearance, and are often distinguished from their wild ancestors or related species by these intentionally cultivated traits."], "non-cultivars": ["Species of alien origin that were introduced to Switzerland without intentional human modification for ornamental purposes, whereas cultivars are those that have undergone deliberate alteration for aesthetic or economic value.", "Plant species grown in their natural state, without selective breeding or cultivation for specific traits, and not modified through human intervention for commercial or ornamental purposes.", "Plants that do not result from human-controlled processes of selective breeding or hybridization, and therefore have not been intentionally modified to exhibit specific traits, such as earlier germination."], "light levels": ["The degree of radiant energy available to influence the development and behavior of plants, where higher levels provide more optimal conditions for growth and germination, while lower levels may exhibit varying degrees of constraint.", "The amount of radiant energy emitted by the surrounding environment that affects the growth and development of plant species, including the rate and success of germination, which was manipulated in the experiment to test the responsiveness of different species.", "The ambient illumination conditions to which a plant is exposed, which can vary in intensity to mimic different natural environments, such as sun-drenched or shaded areas."], "germination": ["The process by which a dormant or newly produced plant structure breaks through or emerges from a seed coat or other enclosure, marking the transition from seedling to growing plant.", "The process by which a dormant or reproductive structure, typically found in the seed or spore stage of a plant's life cycle, begins to sprout and develop into a growing plant, characterized by the emergence of a root system, stem, and foliage.", "The process by which a seed or spore begins to grow and develop into a young plant, characterized by the emergence of a sprout or seedling from the seed coat."], "germination characteristics": ["The capacity of a plant to sprout and begin growth, measured by factors such as the time it takes for seeds to emerge, the percentage of seeds that germinate, and the rate at which seedlings develop, which can influence the plant's ability to establish and spread in a new environment.", "The innate abilities of a plant species to initiate and sustain growth from seed, including its speed and frequency of seedling emergence, which are often used to assess its potential for spreading and establishing itself in a new environment.", "The measureable properties that describe how quickly and successfully seeds sprout and grow into seedlings."], "naturalization": ["The process by which a non-native species, once introduced to an ecosystem, gradually becomes established and spreads on its own, often through a combination of adaptation to local conditions and human activities, leading to increased abundance and distribution over time.", "The process by which an introduced species, initially thriving in a novel environment due to its adapted traits, becomes a self-sustaining component of the local ecosystem, capable of reproducing and expanding its range without further human assistance.", "The process by which a non-native species, often deliberately or accidentally introduced to a new environment, gradually adapts to its new surroundings and becomes a persistent, self-sustaining component of the ecosystem."], "introduced species": ["A species whose dispersal and establishment in a new region are facilitated by human activity, resulting in a skewed representation of its characteristics in the invasive or naturalized population compared to its native range, and potentially contributing to the mistaken association of specific traits with invasive behavior.", "A plant species that is brought to a new geographic location, often as a result of human activity, and may thrive and multiply in its new environment due to favorable conditions or characteristics.", "A non-native species that has been intentionally or unintentionally brought into an ecosystem through human activity, and has the potential to outcompete or displace native species for resources, leading to ecological and evolutionary changes."], "ornamental plants": ["Plants that are cultivated and bred for their aesthetic appeal, often selected for their attractive flowers, foliage, or growth habits, and are commonly grown in gardens, parks, or greenhouses.", "Plants intentionally grown and propagated for aesthetic purposes, often for decorative or symbolic value, by humans.", "Plants intentionally cultivated and often selectively bred for their aesthetically pleasing appearance, such as in gardens, parks, and other landscaped areas, which may be more likely to exhibit characteristics such as fast and abundant germination."]}
