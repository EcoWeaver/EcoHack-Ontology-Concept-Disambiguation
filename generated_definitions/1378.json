displaced by a similar species originating from a different geographic area, resulting in significant ecological disruption.", "A non-native organism that has colonized a new ecosystem, often displacing native species and altering the ecological balance, and is subsequently spread through human activity or natural means."], "heavy metal toxicity": ["The harmful or poisonous effects that occur when an organism is exposed to certain environmental substances, characterized by the disruption of normal physiological processes and potentially leading to adverse outcomes, including but not limited to, damage to cells, tissues, and organs.", "The adverse effect that occurs when a specific class of naturally occurring elements, often found in environmental pollutants, exceeds a certain threshold and interacts with the biological processes of an organism, causing harm to its development, growth, or survival.", "The harmful effect of certain naturally occurring substances with high density, causing damage to the biological processes and structure of aquatic organisms at very low concentrations, often resulting in impairment of growth, development, and reproduction."], "nauplii": ["The early developmental stage of a certain group of crustaceans, characterized by the presence of distinct mouthparts and limbs, and typically consisting of a single instar.", "The earliest larval stage of certain crustaceans, characterized by their simple, non-motile structure and vulnerability to environmental pollutants, particularly heavy metals.", "The early, free-swimming larval stage of certain crustaceans, including certain aquatic invertebrates, typically small and fragile, which are often studied for their sensitivity to environmental pollutants and toxins."], "Branchiopoda": ["A group of crustaceans characterized by having a distinctive combination of gills and limbs, often found in aquatic environments and featuring a unique form of reproduction, typically involving parthenogenesis.", "A subgroup of crustaceans characterized by their primitive, nauplius-like larval stage and a unique type of biramous limb, often inhabiting brackish or saline waters and including species that are both native to certain regions and have been introduced to other areas through human activity.", "A subphylum of crustaceans that includes a variety of freshwater and saline organisms characterized by the development of nauplii, microscopic larval stages that are sensitive to environmental factors such as heavy metals."], "Anostraca": ["A taxonomic group of freshwater crustaceans characterized by their branchiopodan features and ability to reproduce parthenogenetically, inhabiting saline environments.", "A group of small, crustacean-like animals that are a type of ancient, segmented body plan that reproduce parthenogenetically, often inhabiting saltwater environments and featuring a unique life cycle.", "A group of small, aquatic crustaceans that belong to a specific class of animals that feed on algae and other tiny organisms, commonly found in brackish waters and salt lakes."], "Saline di Cervia": ["A coastal area in Italy known for its saline waters, home to a native species of brine shrimp.", "A coastal area in Italy known for its brackish water features and supporting a local population of a specific species of branchiopod crustacean.", "A shallow,

toxicity."], "Ravenna": ["A region in Italy known for its salty lakes and marshes that provide a habitat for certain crustaceans.", "A city in Northern Italy known for its rich history and natural environments, including saline habitats that are home to certain aquatic organisms.", "A coastal region in northern Italy where a specific species of brine shrimp is native and has been compared to a non-native invasive species for their sensitivity to heavy metal toxicity."], "Italy": ["A region in southern Europe known for its diverse landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and coastline along the Mediterranean Sea, which is home to unique aquatic ecosystems and invasive species, including Branchiopoda and Anostraca.", "A region on the continent of Eurasia, home to a brackish lake where a specific species of small crustacean (Anostraca) lives alongside a variety of other aquatic life.", "A country in Southern Europe where a saline lake, home to a species of branchiopod crustacean, is located."], "": ["A microscopic crustacean species, often used as a model organism in aquatic toxicity studies, particularly when investigating the impact of pollutants on aquatic ecosystems, with a

symbiotic relationships with other organisms and playing a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of that environment.", "The natural population of a specific region that is native and original, as opposed to non-native species that have been introduced and are considered invasive."]}
