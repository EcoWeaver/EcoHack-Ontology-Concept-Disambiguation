growth due to low precipitation and high temperatures, where water scarcity and extreme dryness create conditions challenging for life to thrive.", "A type of environment characterized by extreme dryness, limited water availability, and unique vegetation adaptations, often resulting in a landscape dominated by sparse vegetation and soil that is readily eroded or parched, and where plants have evolved specialized strategies to conserve water.", "A region characterized by a chronic scarcity of water resources, extreme temperature fluctuations, and limited vegetation growth, often resulting in a stark contrast between the abundance of certain species and the paucity of others."]}
