world, without making assumptions about the underlying data distribution."], "biogeographic realms": ["Regions of the world characterized by unique combinations of environmental factors, such as climate, geology, and vegetation, which influence the evolution and distribution of plant and animal species within them.", "Geographic areas that can be characterized by distinct suites of species that have evolved and adapted to specific environmental conditions, and are often separated from other such areas by significant geographical barriers or gradients of environmental variation.", "Geographic areas that serve as natural boundaries, shaping the distribution and migration patterns of organisms over time, and are often characterized by shared ecological conditions, climate, and evolutionary history."], "geographical origin": ["The region or area from which a particular species of ant is typically found or is believed to have originated, often influencing its ability to establish itself in a new location.", "The region from which a species is native, which influences the likelihood of its establishment in a new area after being introduced, as its climatic characteristics and geographic proximity to the destination may facilitate its survival and reproduction.", "The native region or area from which a species has evolved and spread, influencing its characteristics and potential for establishment in new environments."], "climate": ["The underlying patterns of atmospheric conditions and regional environmental factors that influence the distribution and adaptation of living organisms, playing a crucial role in shaping the pathways and outcomes of species introduction and establishment.", "The characteristic set of environmental conditions that influence the distribution and suitability of life, encompassing factors such as temperature, humidity, and vegetation patterns.", "The subtle interplay of environmental factors that shape the ecological niches of living organisms, influencing the likelihood of successful colonization and establishment in new geographic areas."], "occurrence data": ["The collection of recorded instances or sightings of a particular species or organism at a specific location, which are used to track its geographic distribution, frequency, and presence over time.", "The information gathered on the presence or absence of specific species in particular regions, obtained through systematic observations, surveys, or studies, which provides insight into the spread and establishment of these species in new areas.", "The quantitative information about the presence or absence of specific species at particular geographic locations, obtained through scientific research and documentation."], "temperate regions": ["Areas with moderate annual temperature fluctuations, characterized by relatively stable and humid climates, with distinct seasons, but neither extreme cold nor heat, allowing for a wide range of ecosystem diversity.", "Regions characterized by a mild climate with moderate temperatures and rainfall, often featuring a mix of deciduous and evergreen vegetation, where the seasonal changes are not extreme and the average temperature ranges from around 0\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C (32\u00b0F to 68\u00b0F), making them suitable for a diverse range of plant and animal species.", "Areas with moderate climate conditions, characterized by a lack of extreme temperatures and humidity, allowing for a diverse range of flora and fauna to thrive, making them an ideal habitat for many ant species."], "establishment": ["The process by which a non-native species becomes a self-sustaining population in a new region, where it reproduces and adapts to its environment, thereby expanding its geographic range.", "The process by which a non-native species, introduced to a new region through human transportation, becomes a self-sustaining population that is able to reproduce and thrive in its new environment.", "The process by which a non-native species, initially introduced to a new region through human transportation, becomes permanently settled and reproduces in its new habitat, marking its successful integration into the local ecosystem."], "introduction": ["The unintentional transportation of an insect species from one geographic region to another through human activity, resulting in the species' presence in a new location where it did not previously exist.", "The process by which an ant species, originating from a distinct geographic area, is unintentionally transported and successfully settles in a new location, resulting in its presence outside of its natural range.", "The process by which a species that is not native to a region becomes present in that region through human transportation or other intentional or unintentional means, resulting in the potential establishment of a new population or individual."], "trade rates": ["The frequency and
