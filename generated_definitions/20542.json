native species interactions.", "A non-native organism that gains a foothold in an ecosystem and spreads rapidly, often outcompeting or outreproducing native species, thereby altering the ecological balance and potentially causing significant harm to the environment, economy, or human health.", "Organisms that are introduced to a non-native ecosystem through human activity and are capable of outcompeting native species for resources and habitat, leading to significant harm to the environment and biodiversity."], "spatial autocorrelation": ["The presence of repeating patterns or structures in the spatial distribution of a species, where similar characteristics or traits are more likely to occur near each other than would be expected by chance, due to factors such as dispersal, colonization, or other biological processes.", "The phenomenon where observations of a species' presence or absence in different locations are more likely to resemble each other when they are closer together than when they are farther apart, reflecting underlying patterns of colonization, dispersal, and ecological relationships.", "The phenomenon where the characteristics of a geographic area are more likely to be similar to those of nearby areas, due to shared environmental, biological, or other influences, which can lead to patterns of similarity and clustering in the distribution of species or other features across a region."], "biogeographical data": ["Data describing the geographic distribution and range of various species across different ecosystems, typically involving complex spatial relationships and patterns of species co-occurrence, abundance, and distribution.", "Data that describes the geographical distribution and characteristics of different species of plants and

living organisms, which often exhibits complex structures and patterns shaped by their evolutionary history, ecological interactions, and environmental conditions."], "biological invasions": ["The process of a non-native species gradually replacing a native species in an ecosystem, often as a result of human activity, leading to significant changes in the environment and potentially causing harm to the native ecosystem's balance and biodiversity.", "The process by which non-native species that are introduced to a new area through human activity or natural means spread and establish self-sustaining populations, potentially disrupting native ecosystems and causing ecological, economic, and social impacts.", "The phenomenon where non-native organisms successfully colonize and spread within an ecosystem, often causing harm to the native biodiversity and ecosystem processes."], "dispersal": ["The process by which individuals or organisms migrate or spread out from their original point of introduction to colonize new areas, often resulting in the formation of spatially structured patterns in their distribution.", "The process by which living organisms spread out from their initial point of origin, allowing for the expansion of their populations across varying distances, shaped by factors such as environmental conditions, biology, and human activities.", "The process by which a species or population spreads and colonizes new areas, often driven by environmental factors or human activities, and resulting in a particular arrangement of its distribution across a geographical range."], "colonization": ["The process by which a non-native organism establishes a presence in a new geographic area, facilitated by the movement of individuals or reproductive units from their original habitat, often leading to changes in the ecological balance and biodiversity of the invaded region.", "The process by which a non-native species successfully establishes and spreads a foothold in a new, unoccupied geographic area, often facilitated by human activity or other environmental factors, and shapes the distribution of its presence through repeated attempts and adaptive behavior.", "The process by which a non-native organism becomes established and spreads within a new geographic area, often resulting in a distinct pattern of distribution."], "invasive species distribution models": ["Models that predict the likelihood of non-native organisms being present in a specific location, taking into account the factors that influence their spread and establishment, such as dispersal and colonization processes.", "Models that predict the likelihood of a non-native organism spreading and establishing a population in new areas, based on factors such as environmental characteristics, human activity, and biological traits.", "A scientific tool used to predict and understand the geographic patterns and processes governing the spread of non-native
