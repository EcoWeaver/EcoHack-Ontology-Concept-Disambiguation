curved structures that are arranged in a dense manner on a surface, serving to deter removal or consumption by unwanted agents."], "herbivore": ["An organism that consumes the edible or nutritious parts of another organism for its own sustenance, posing a potential threat to the survival and reproduction of that organism.", "A type of consumer that obtains its nutrients by feeding on the fleshy parts of a plant, including its fruits and stems.", "A consumer that feeds on plants, particularly on the fleshy parts of fruits, but is likely to be deterred by certain structures designed for protection."], "dispersal": ["The process by which the seeds of a plant species are transported to new locations, often facilitated by structures or adaptations that enable them to survive and thrive
