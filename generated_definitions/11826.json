native trout species, exhibiting a distinct set of olfactory cues that, when recognized by prey animals, evoke a differential response intensity compared to its parental species."], "invasive species": ["Organisms that are introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, often lacking natural predators or competing species, and can outcompete native species for resources, disrupt ecological balances, and potentially cause harm to local biodiversity and ecosystem function.", "A species whose odour signals, when encountered by a prey animal, trigger a heightened response and perceived threat, regardless of the actual danger posed by the species, due to its unfamiliarity and unknown characteristics to the prey.", "An organism that is intentionally or unintentionally introduced to a new geographic area, outcompetes native species for resources, and alters the ecosystem's dynamics, often posing a threat to native biodiversity and ecological stability, ultimately requiring predator recognition to adapt to the changed environment."], "introduced species": ["A species that originates from outside a specific ecological area and is brought to that area, often intentionally or unintentionally, by human activity or natural means, resulting in the potential for ecological disruption and impact on native species.", "Organisms whose presence in a particular
