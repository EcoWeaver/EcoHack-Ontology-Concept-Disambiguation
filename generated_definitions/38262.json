their origin.", "A genus of freshwater snails native to a specific lake in Japan, known for their ability to spread accidentally through the contamination of aquatic plants and animals, and distinguishable by specific characteristics of their shells.", "A type of freshwater snail genus characterized by its distinct shell morphology, which can be identified by the combination of three key features: the number of longitudinal ribs on the penultimate whorl of the adult shell, the angle of the shell's spire, and the height of the largest embryonic shell."], "Lake Biwa": ["The largest freshwater body in a specific East Asian country, known for being home to a diverse range of native snail species that have been inadvertently introduced to other locations.", "The largest freshwater lake in Japan, renowned for its native snail species, which have been inadvertently introduced to various locations through the transportation of non-indigenous aquatic organisms.", "A large

spiral, outer shell that provides protection and support.", "The group of invertebrate animals that includes marine, freshwater, and terrestrial organisms characterized by a soft, often slimy body and a typically spiral shell or internal shell secreted by a mantle."], "gastropoda": ["The phylum comprising the majority of land and freshwater mollusks, characterized by a single large body part that contains their vital organs, and having a typically spiral or whorled shape.", "A group of mollusks characterized by a predominantly aquatic lifestyle, external shells that grow as the individual

a certain group of aquatic animals, often visible as a whorled or ribbed shape.", "The outer, calcareous or hard, covering of a specific type of aquatic invertebrate that serves as a protective casing, exhibits various characteristics that can be used for identification purposes, and is influenced by the animal's development and growth.", "The external covering of a freshwater snail, composed of layered secretions, characterized by ridges, angles, and a certain height, used to identify the species and distinguish it from others."], "seedlings": ["Juvenile, fragile, and often transported entities derived from aquatic or terrestrial plants, which may unintentionally harbor non-native species, potentially causing ecological disturbances.", "Young, cultivated organisms of a

intentionally or unintentionally transported and potentially causing biological invasion and disruption to a new environment."], "shellfish": ["Organisms that are aquatic, often found in freshwater
