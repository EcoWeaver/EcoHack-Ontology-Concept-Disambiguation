reproductive success, while simultaneously contributing to further ecosystem changes that disadvantage native species.", "Species that benefit from, or require, disruptions of ecosystem processes or properties, contributing to declines of native species, but also drive further changes in ecosystem properties, ultimately leading to increased native species declines."], "passenger": ["A species that is inadvertently affected by changes in ecosystem properties, thereby exhibiting symptoms of a broader underlying problem, rather than being the primary cause of native species declines.", "A species that merely occupies an ecosystem following a disturbance or change, but does not significantly contribute to the decline of native species or alterations of the ecosystem.", "A species that exhibits no significant influence on native species declines, existing solely as a result of altered ecosystem properties or processes and providing an indirect indication of deeper underlying disturbances, rather than actively driving changes in the ecosystem."], "driver": ["A force that is directly responsible for the introduction of novel traits or functions to an ecosystem, leading to the decline of native species, often through the introduction of a new invasive species that alters the ecosystem's dynamics.", "A direct causal agent that introduces novel traits or functions to an
