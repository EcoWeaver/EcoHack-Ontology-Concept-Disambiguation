invasive species.", "A medium-sized, adaptable feline predator native to North America, known for its solitary behavior and opportunistic hunting habits, which, when encountering a threat to its territory or young, can exhibit fierce and territorial behavior.", "A medium-sized, carnivorous predator native to southern Florida, characterized by its distinctive facial markings and ability to exhibit novel behaviors in response to the presence of an invasive species, particularly when defending its territory or young against an unattended nesting site."], "Burmese python": ["A large, invasive, serpent-like animal native to a distant region, commonly introduced to other areas where it can cause ecological harm and become a prominent threat to native wildlife, particularly in subtropical ecosystems like Florida's Greater Everglades.", "A non-native, large, serpent-like species native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its ability to adapt and thrive in a new environment, leading to negative impacts on local ecosystems.", "A large, invasive serpent native to Southeast Asia, notorious for outcompeting native species in ecosystems where it has established itself, particularly in the Greater Everglades region of Florida, where it has been known to prey on native wildlife and engage in aggressive territorial behaviors."], "python nest": ["A secluded enclosure constructed by a species of non-venomous snake for the purpose of laying and incubating eggs, typically marked by a distinctive structure or arrangement of vegetation and often used for defense against potential threats.", "A complex structure composed of twigs, leaves, and other plant material, used by a certain species of large, burrowing reptile for laying and incubating its eggs, often carefully concealed and defended against potential predators.", "A protected area on land where a group of serpent offspring are laid, incubated, and reared by their parent, characterized by the presence of vulnerable young and the potential for parental care."], "depredation": ["The act of a predator consuming or destroying the offspring, eggs, or nesting materials of another predator, often in a competitive or antagonistic manner.", "The act of an apex predator, often driven by instinct, actively removing and consuming the reproductive output or vulnerable individuals of another predator
