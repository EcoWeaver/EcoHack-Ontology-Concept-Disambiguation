established range, where the population begins to increase in density and alter the local ecosystem dynamics.", "The extent of an organism's geographical distribution, encompassing the areas it initially occupies and those it subsequently colonizes through a process of dispersal and settlement, characterized by varying levels of abundance, demographic structure, and habitat preference."], "abundance": ["The number of individuals of a specific species present in a given area or environment, often used as an indicator of a population's size or density.", "The number of individual

reproduction, as observed in the movement and settlement patterns of the round goby in the Trent-Severn Waterway.", "The specific types of physical environments or structures that an invasive species occupies and interacts with during its range expansion, which can influence its population dynamics and behavior.", "The specific combination and preference of environmental conditions and physical features that an invasive species utilizes to survive and thrive in a particular area, such as the type of substrate, water quality, or vegetation."], "invasion pathway": ["The course of events that defines the spread of a non-native species through a newly colonized territory, characterized by changes in abundance, demographic characteristics, and habitat use over time.", "The sequence of spatial locations through which an invasive species spreads and colonizes new areas, often exhibiting characteristic changes in abundance, demographics, and habitat use as it advances.", "The sequence of geographical locations through which an invasive species spreads and becomes established in a previously unoccupied area, during which its population size and demographics change in response to the surrounding environment and other species."], "occupancy": ["The extent to which a species is present in a specific area or habitat, measured by the proportion of sites where it is found and the number of individuals observed, giving insight into its distribution and population dynamics.", "The extent to which a species is present in a specific area, measured by the proportion of sites or locations within that area where the species is detected or found.", "The number of locations where a species is present and can be found within a specific area or region."], "non-reproductive season": ["The period during which the invasive species does not engage in breeding or reproduction, instead undergoing a rapid expansion of its range into new areas, characterized by a significant increase in population density and dispersal.", "The period of the year when the biological reproduction cycle of a species is not in full operation, characterized by a temporary reduction in population growth and movement, which allows for a focus on expansion and colonization of new habitats.", "The period of the year during which the population of a species is most active in colonizing new habitats, characterized by increased dispersal, rapid growth, and adaptation to novel environments, typically coinciding with seasonal changes that affect environmental conditions and resource
