Italy."], "arthropoda": ["A term referring to a group of organisms that belong to the phylum Arthropoda, which consists of animals that have jointed legs, multiple body parts, and a hard exoskeleton, including insects, arachnids, and crustaceans, among others.", "A diverse group of eight-legged invertebrates, including spiders, insects, and centipedes, that possess exoskeletons, segmented bodies, and jointed limbs.", "A group of invertebrate animals with jointed limbs, exoskeletons, and segmented bodies, including a wide range of organisms from insects to arachnids and others, that are often found in aquatic and terrestrial environments."], "mollusca": ["A group of animals characterized by their soft, unsegmented bodies, often covered in shells or other protective coverings, and typically living in or near water.", "A group of soft-bodied invertebrates characterized by a shell, often found in aquatic or coastal environments, comprising a wide range of species with varied morphology and ecological roles.", "A group of soft-bodied animals that typically have a shell, usually living in water or damp environments, and often featuring radially symmetrical body structure, including slugs, snails, squids, and other related creatures."], "crustacean": ["A type of small, usually aquatic animal that belongs to a group characterized by a hard outer shell and multiple limbs, often found in or near water, and includes examples that are considered invasive and potentially detrimental to local ecosystems.", "A type of aquatic invertebrate with a hard outer shell, often characterized by having multiple segments or limbs, and playing a crucial role in ecosystems as both predators and prey.", "A type of aquatic animal that has a hard outer shell, multiple limbs, and typically lives in water, belonging to the phylum Arthropoda and class Malacostraca."], "rodent": ["A type of small, typically furry, mammal that is known to thrive in a variety of environments and often poses a threat to local ecosystems due to its ability to multiply quickly and outcompete native species for resources.", "Small, primarily terrestrial mammals characterized by one pair of continuously growing incisors in each jaw, which they use to gnaw and feed on a wide variety of food sources, often found in close association with human settlements and agricultural areas.", "A small, mammalian animal that is a terrestrial omnivore, typically having large ears and teeth adapted for gnawing, and often found in habitats with vegetation or aquatic environments."], "invasive species": ["Species that are not native to a specific ecosystem, yet have established themselves through human activity or natural means, often outcompeting and displacing native species, potentially causing significant ecological and economic harm.", "A non-native organism that settles and multiplies in a new environment, often causing harm to the native ecosystem, and forming relationships with other species that could potentially disrupt the ecological balance.", "A type of non-native organism that becomes established and grows unchecked in a particular ecosystem, potentially causing harm to the local environment, economy, and native species."], "food chain": ["A series of feeding relationships between organisms, where one species consumes another, creating a hierarchical structure that supports
