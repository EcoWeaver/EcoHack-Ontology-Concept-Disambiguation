another plant species, altering its ability to germinate, grow, or thrive.", "The phenomenon by which a chemical substance released from one plant has a direct influence on the growth, development, or reproduction of another plant, potentially inhibiting or enhancing its germination, growth, or overall fitness."], "Species-specific": ["The degree to which the response of a particular plant to an external substance, such as a leaf leachate, varies based on the plant's inherent characteristics, leading to different levels of inhibition or promotion of germination depending on the plant species.", "The responsiveness of a particular plant's germination rate or process to the presence of a certain substance, such as a leaf leachate, which can vary depending on the specific characteristics of that plant and is most pronounced at a specific concentration, resulting in a unique pattern of inhibition or promotion.", "The phenomenon where the effectiveness of an environmental factor in affecting the growth or development of organisms is determined by the specific type of organism being studied, resulting in varying degrees of response depending on the organism's characteristics and properties."], "Dose-dependent": ["The extent to which the level of impact on seed germination, caused by a substance extracted from a plant, increases or decreases as
