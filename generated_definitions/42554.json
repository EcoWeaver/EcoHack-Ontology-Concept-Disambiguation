global commerce while simultaneously posing a threat to local ecosystems through the unintentional introduction of non-native species.", "The process of moving goods across long distances over the

the ecological balance and biodiversity of an ecosystem, often facilitated by human activities such as trade and transportation.", "Species introduced to a new ecosystem through human activities, such

diversity of native biota."], "transboundary": ["The phenomenon where environmental pollution or ecological threats cross borders, posing a unified risk to ecosystems and biodiversity, requiring international cooperation and management strategies to mitigate its impacts.", "The movement or impact of a problem or effect across geographical boundaries, causing simultaneous concerns or consequences in multiple jurisdictions, often necessitating international coordination and cooperation to address the issue.", "The phenomenon where a pollution or ecological threat knows no borders, requiring international cooperation and collective action to mitigate its effects."], "ports": ["An area of concentrated maritime activity where goods are loaded, unloaded, and processed, serving as a hub for international trade and potentially facilitating the transfer of invasive species between countries.", "A location where goods, especially cargo and commodities, are unloaded from and loaded onto vehicles, trains, or ships for the purpose of commercial trade and logistics, and where environmental concerns are crucial due to the proximity of such activities to natural ecosystems.", "Points of access where goods and cargo are transferred between vessels and land, often used as hubs for international trade and potential entry points for invasive species."], "Pacific coast": ["The shoreline area of the Americas where the Pacific Ocean meets the landmasses, encompassing a geographic region characterized by maritime trade ports and a high risk of invasive species introduction through international shipping.", "The western shoreline of the Americas, stretching from a certain point south of the Arctic Circle to the southernmost tip of a large mountain range.", "The geographic area along the western edge of the North American continent, bounded by the vast expanse of ocean and characterized by a chain of mountain ranges, scenic coastal cities, and a diverse array

Agreement (USMCA) in 2020, sharing a common North American continental shelf and engaging in significant maritime trade activities.", "A group of countries in North America, including a large and economically powerful nation known for its cowboy culture and southern border with Mexico, as well as its northern neighbor, a country with a bilingual population and a reputation for natural beauty
