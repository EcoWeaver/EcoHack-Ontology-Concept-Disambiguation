different forms of plant and animal life, including their unique characteristics, features, and roles within ecosystems."], "secondary contact": ["The re-establishment of geographical overlap between previously isolated populations of a species, following changes to their shared environment or distribution, which can lead to hybridization and potentially detrimental consequences for the persistence of one or both involved populations.", "The process by which previously distinct populations or species that were separated by geographical barriers come into direct contact again, potentially leading to the exchange of genetic material and altering the evolutionary trajectory of the involved species.", "The re-establishment of genetic interaction between previously geographically isolated populations or species that have been separated for a sufficient period of time to have undergone distinct evolutionary divergence, often as a result of environmental changes or human activities."], "formerly allopatric taxa": ["Species that were previously geographically separated from each other and had not interbred in recent evolutionary history, potentially leading to distinct genetic differences, but have since come into contact with each other, often due to human activities.", "Species that were previously geographically isolated from one another, but now occupy

biological entities that were previously geographically or genetically separate are unable to produce viable offspring or maintain a viable population without the influence of external factors.", "The state where populations of a species are incapable of producing viable, fertile offspring when interbreeding, either due to genetic or behavioral barriers, ensuring the purity of each species' gene
