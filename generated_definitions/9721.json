of roads, rails, and inland waterways, and the size of the population.", "Characteristics of a city that relate to its infrastructure, human population, and environmental conditions, which potentially influence the composition and diversity of plant species within that urban area.", "Characteristics of cities that are often closely linked to human activities and the infrastructure of urban areas, such as transportation systems, population size, and other features that influence the local environment and biodiversity."], "floristic structure": ["The composition and arrangement of plant species in a given urban area, encompassing the relative abundance and distribution of native and non-native species, as well as their unique characteristics, in order to convey a distinct profile of the area's biodiversity.", "The qualitative and quantitative arrangement of plant species and their proportions within a specific urban environment, encompassing their diversity, rarity, and distribution.", "The composition and arrangement of plant species in a given urban area, including the number of species present, the proportion of rare or unique species, and the presence of non-native or invasive species."], "species": ["A fundamental unit of biodiversity that represents a distinct and self-replicating type of organism, distinguishable from others through a unique combination of characteristics, traits, and properties that define its form, function, and behavior, serving as a distinct identifier in the classification and categorization of living organisms.", "A specific type of organism that can be distinguished from others of the same group by one or more characteristics that are not shared with others, and which can be identified as a unique entity in a particular ecosystem or area.", "A naturally occurring grouping of distinct entities that share common characteristics, such as morphological, physiological, and reproductive features, and can be identified and classified independently within a specific ecological context."], "unique species": ["The number of plant species present in a given urban area that are not found in surrounding
