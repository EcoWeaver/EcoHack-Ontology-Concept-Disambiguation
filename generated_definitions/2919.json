finding a mate to reproduce, which can be challenging in small populations, leading to variable reproductive success.", "A type of non-reproducing invasive species that requires external assistance to mate and produce offspring, often leading to reduced population growth and success in small founding populations, yet can thrive in larger or genetically diverse populations."], "founder populations":

mate or partner leads to a positive relationship between individual reproductive success and population size or density, as a result of which small populations struggle to maintain their viability.", "The phenomenon where the inability to find a suitable mate or reproduction partner, often due to limited population size or density, leads to a positive relationship between individual fitness and population size or density, thereby hindering the spread and establishment of a population.", "The phenomenon where the reproductive success of individuals in small populations or low-density environments is positively correlated with the number of individuals present, as they are more likely to find a mate and reproduce successfully."], "maternal fitness": ["The likelihood of a plant to

per unit of floral production, capturing the relationship between flower and seed quantity.", "The measure of reproductive productivity of a plant, characterized by the quantity of viable offspring produced by a single reproductive unit, which can be influenced by factors such as population size and genetic relatedness.", "The quantity of reproductive units produced by a single matured structure that contains the reproductive material of a plant, influenced by the individual's genetic makeup and environmental conditions, and serving as a metric for measuring the success of a plant's reproductive efforts."], "genetic relatedness": ["The degree to which individual plants within a population share a common genetic heritage, affecting the probability of successful mating and reproduction.", "The probability that two individuals in a population will have a similar genetic makeup, arising from the shared ancestral history and demographic factors that have shaped the population's gene pool, ultimately affecting their ability to successfully reproduce.", "The degree to which individuals within a population share a common gene pool, thereby influencing their ability to reproduce and produce viable offspring."], "ecological genetic obstacle": ["A hindrance arising from the interplay between demographic and genetic factors that inhibits the reproductive success of a colonizing species, impeding its transition from small founder populations to larger, more established populations that can overcome the limitations of initial colonization and thrive in a new
