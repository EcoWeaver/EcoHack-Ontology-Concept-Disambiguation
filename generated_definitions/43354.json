populations have already reached high levels, making early detection and management crucial to prevent economic and environmental damage.", "Organisms that, by virtue of their introduction into a specific ecosystem, pose a potential threat to the integrity and sustainability of that ecosystem through their feeding, breeding, and/or reproduction habits, often resulting in undesirable ecological and economic impacts."], "cryptic forest pests": ["Species that are often difficult to detect in their early stages of invasion, often remaining hidden or exhibiting subtle signs of presence, requiring extensive surveillance and identification expertise to confirm their presence in a forest ecosystem.", "Pests whose presence in a forest ecosystem often remains undetected until their populations have become established, requiring delayed detection and potential eradication or containment measures.", "Species of pests that are not easily detectable in a forest ecosystem, often remaining undetected until their populations have grown significantly, allowing them to become well established before their presence is recognized."], "population": ["The aggregation of individuals of a particular biological taxon that occupy a defined geographic area, often manifesting through their collective presence or activity, and whose abundance or distribution can indicate the presence or establishment of a species or organism.", "The number of individual organisms of a particular species, or their collective presence in a given area, that is often first recognized after the species has already achieved a certain level of abundance and establishment.", "A collectivity of entities, often scattered or dispersed, that may go unnoticed or remain latent until their numbers have grown substantial, thereby posing a threat to ecological systems."], "program": ["A strategic system designed to detect and monitor potential environmental threats, typically implemented in areas with high
