islands through its consumption of rabbits and other small mammals.", "A medium-sized bird of prey that plays a significant role in the dispersal of weed seeds on oceanic islands, by consuming invasive mammals that have ingested these seeds and then depositing the seeds in its pellets, along with those of other plant species, as it preys on these mammals.", "A medium-sized predatory bird, native to certain regions, that preys on small mammals and accidentally disperses seeds from invasive plant species through its feces."], "European Rabbits": ["Small, burrowing mammals native to the Iberian Peninsula, introduced to other regions through human activity, and often serving as seed transporters for various plant species before being consumed by predators like raptors, which then disperse the seeds through their pellets.", "An invasive mammal species native to the Iberian Peninsula, often serving as a vector for seed dispersal by carrying plant species in their gastrointestinal tract.", "Mammalian herbivores native to the continent of Europe, notorious for their ability to ingest seeds of various plant species, which are then carried into the digestive
