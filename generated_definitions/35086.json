on the environment."], "Mexico": ["A country of origin from which a biological control agent was introduced to a distant region for the purpose of managing a non-native plant species.", "The geographic region where a certain type of insect native to an introduced biological control agent was sourced from for deployment in another geographic area to manage a non-native plant species.", "A geographic location known for being the country of origin for certain biological control agents deliberately introduced to other regions for the purpose of managing invasive plant species."],

often brightly colored and produces nectar-rich flowers, attracting pollinators and serving as a habitat for beneficial insects.", "The portion of a flowering plant that produces seeds, typically comprising a dense cluster of tiny flowers, often surrounded by a receptacle and a covering of bracts or sepals, and capable of attracting pollinators."], "seed": ["The fertilized reproductive unit of a flowering plant, containing the genetic material necessary for the development of a new individual, found in the mature ovary of a flower and typically surrounded by a protective covering.", "The
