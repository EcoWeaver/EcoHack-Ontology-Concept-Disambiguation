that an organism is best adapted to, and within which it is most likely to survive and thrive, without significant changes in its life history traits or resource use.", "The specific combination of environmental factors and conditions that a species is adapted to and in which it is able to thrive, encompassing variables such as temperature, precipitation, and daylight exposure.", "The set of environmental conditions, including temperature, precipitation, and other physical factors, that a species is best adapted to occupy and exploit for survival and reproduction."], "biotic specialization": ["The way an organism utilizes specific resources or interacts with other species in its environment, thereby influencing its ability to thrive and compete with other organisms for space, food, and other essential necessities.", "The way in which a species interacts with and exploits specific resources, such as food sources or habitats, in a way that is unique to its particular environment, allowing it to thrive in that ecosystem.", "The way in which a species interacts with and makes use of its surroundings, encompassing the specific resources it consumes and the ecological relationships it maintains."], "resource use": ["The specific ways in which a species utilizes and exploits its environment to gather necessary materials and energy, such as food, shelter, and breeding grounds, that are essential for its survival and reproduction.", "The specific way in which an organism takes advantage of its environment to meet its needs, such as accessing food, shelter, and mates, while also competing with other organisms for these necessities.", "The specific ways in which an organism obtains the necessary sustenance and necessities to survive, such as food, shelter, and companionship, that are characteristic of its adaptation to its environment."], "Grinnelian niche": ["The characteristic pattern of a species' exploitation of environmental resources, encompassing the specific range of resource availability and utilization it can tolerate, as inferred from its distribution and abundance across different ecological contexts.", "The specific set of ecological circumstances, including environmental conditions and resource availability, to which a species has adapted to survive and reproduce, characterized by a particular combination of characteristics that define its habitat preferences.", "The specific set of environmental conditions and resource requirements that a species is adapted to exploit in its natural habitat, encompassing both physical and biological aspects."], "Eltonian niche": ["The specific combination of resources and interactions an organism uses to survive and reproduce in a particular environment, characterized by its unique adaptations and relationships with other species in the ecosystem.", "The set of specific resources and relationships a species relies on to survive and reproduce, such as the types of plants, animals, or microorganisms it interacts with, and the ways it uses them, which are often specialized and unique to the species.", "The specific set of resources that a species requires to survive and reproduce in its environment, encompassing not just the availability of physical conditions such as temperature and humidity, but also the interaction between the species and its biotic environment, including other species and their uses."], "European honeybee": ["A social insect species widely kept by humans for honey production and pollination, known for its ability to thrive in a broad range of climatic and ecological conditions, and characterized by its persistent exploitation of specific plant resources.", "A social insect native to Europe, known for its widespread colonization of non-native habitats, where it maintains its ecological adaptations and specialization in resource use.", "A species of flying, social insect that is native to Europe and has been widely distributed and domesticated, exhibiting a stable niche in its climate and resource use habits across its natural and artificial ranges."], "Apis mellifera": ["A species of bee that has been widely introduced to new areas through human activity, and has retained its original adaptations to climate and resource use despite being outside its native range, likely due to its long history of domestication and evolution.", "A species of insect that has been domesticated for thousands of years and is known for its ability to adapt its resource use and climate preferences to a wide range of environments, while retaining a consistent and stable ecological niche in both its native and introduced ranges.", "A social insect species, native to Europe, that has been domesticated for thousands of years and is known for its ability to adapt to new environments while maintaining its characteristic resource use patterns."], "native range": ["The original geographic area where a species is first found, characterized by its natural evolution and adaptation to the local environment, and is not intentionally introduced or transplanted by humans, but rather occupies its ecological niche in a self-sustaining manner.", "The area where a species first evolved and naturally occurred before being introduced to other regions through human activity, maintaining a strong connection to its evolutionary history and ecological environment.", "The original geographic area from which a species evolved and where it typically resides, exhibiting its typical behaviors, using its typical resources, and interacting with its typical organisms and environment."], "": ["The tendency for species that have been introduced to a new region to retain their original characteristics and habits,

species' invasion of a new region, its ability to thrive in a particular environment and its specific ecological relationships remain relatively consistent with those in its native habitat.", "The tendency for a species to retain its specific adaptations to its environment, including both the climate it can tolerate and the resources it uses, even when introduced to a new geographic region."]}
