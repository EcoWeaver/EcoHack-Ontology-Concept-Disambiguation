population growth and spread.", "Species that have originated from a region or ecosystem, then intentionally or unintentionally spread to a new region or ecosystem through human activities, where they did not previously exist and potentially threaten the local native species and ecosystem balance."], "human transport": ["The deliberate and unintentional movement of living organisms and accompanying factors such as climate, terrain, and other environmental conditions across geographical boundaries, primarily facilitated through human activities and facilitated by infrastructure and technological

the unintended spread of non-native species.", "The organized exchange and movement of goods, services, and ideas across geographical boundaries, facilitated by deliberate human actions and enabled by complex networks and systems.", "The exchange of goods, services, or ideas between different regions or populations, often facilitated by transportation networks, communication systems, and economic

known occurrences or sightings of a particular entity, comprising details such as location, date, and circumstance, which serves as the foundation for building predictive models and understanding its geographic distribution.", "Locations where the presence of a particular taxonomic group has been documented or observed, often through a compilation of data from various sources such as field surveys, literature reviews, or citizen science initiatives.", "Records of documented instances or occurrences of a particular organism's geographical distribution, based on authentic data collected from various sources, often including but not limited to scientific observations, surveys, and museum collections."], "native range": ["The original or ancestral geographic area where a species evolved and initially inhabited, which serves as a reference point for studying its distribution, behavior, and ecological interactions.", "The area where a species originally occurred and is considered its historical and natural habitat, which serves as a reference for modeling its potential distribution and understanding its ecological requirements.", "The geographic area where a species has evolved and naturally occurs, without human introduction, and where its presence has been established for an extended period of time, forming a distinct ecological and genetic entity."], "invasive range": ["The area where a non-native species has been successfully established and is reproducing in the wild, often having a significant impact on the native ecosystem and potentially outcompeting
