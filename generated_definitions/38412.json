perpetuates its dominance over native species, and may hinder restoration efforts."], "alternative state": ["A particular combination of ecological factors and processes that characterize an ecosystem's configuration, potentially distinct from its initial or desired state, which can emerge and persist due to interactions between the environment, native species, and non-native invasive

desired trajectory, often maintained through self-reinforcing mechanisms or feedback loops that hinder the system's return to its original or target state.", "A state of an ecosystem that is different from its natural or desired condition, maintained by a self-reinforcing cycle of interacting factors, which can persist even after the initial catalyst has been removed."], "ecosystem": ["A collection of interacting components, including plants and other organisms, that influence and shape each other's behavior, composition, and functionality within a specific geographic area, with the potential to exhibit multiple stable states that can be affected by external factors, such as the presence of invasive species.", "A complex web of interconnected components, including living organisms and non-living elements, that interact and adapt to one another, resulting in the emergence of distinct patterns and dynamics that define the system's identity and functionality.", "A complex network of interacting elements, where subtle changes in one component can have cascading effects on the entire system, potentially leading to the establishment of alternative states that may be difficult to reverse without addressing the underlying drivers."], "plant community structure": ["The arrangement and interrelation of plant species in a given environment, encompassing the composition, distribution, and dominance of individual species within that ecosystem.", "The configuration of multiple species and their interactions within a specific environment, including the distribution,

influencing the composition of plant communities within it.", "The accumulation of organic debris, resulting from the breakdown of plant material, which can significantly alter the structural composition of a plant community and perpetuate alternative ecosystem states.", "A layer of decaying organic matter that forms on the surface of an ecosystem, playing a critical role in altering the

specific environment and play a crucial role in the ecosystem's natural balance and biodiversity, typically found growing abundantly before human intervention or disturbance.", "The naturally occurring vegetation of a specific region, characterized by a long history of co-evolution with the local environment, and which has developed unique adaptations to thrive in the native ecosystem, thereby maintaining ecological balance and diversity.", "The term refers to plant species that have evolved over time within a specific geographic region, are well-suited to its climatic and environmental conditions, and are indigenous to that area, whereas others may be more recently introduced and potentially invasive."], "non-native forb": ["A type of flowering plant that is not indigenous to the specific ecosystem or region, and can form dense communities, often altering the existing plant community structure and potentially outcompeting native species for resources.", "A type of flowering plant that is not native to the region and can dominate the plant community, often outcompeting native species, and can be found in specific ecosystems, such as vernal pools.", "A type of plant that grows abundantly in vernal pools and is not typically found in these ecosystems, often becoming dominant when native plants are absent or suppressed."], "invasive grasses": ["A type of non-native plant that colonizes an ecosystem and alters its composition, primarily through the deposition of organic matter that facilitates the proliferation of the same species, potentially limiting the re-establishment of native plant communities.", "Non-native, non-woody plant species that dominate the plant community structure in vernal pools, are capable of altering the ecosystem's conditions in favor of their own persistence, and can facilitate the establishment of a self-sustaining alternative state.", "Non-native, herbaceous plants that grow in a vernal pool ecosystem and alter its community structure, leading to a persistent shift away from the native plant community, and creating conditions that are conducive to their own survival and propagation."], "inundation
