technology or solution based on a shared understanding of its potential benefits and risks, where trust and confidence in the responsible authorities and institutions are key factors in overcoming concerns and opposition.", "The implicit consent or acceptance of a community to engage in a particular activity or technology, granted by its perceived benefits, trust in implementing authorities, and recognition of potential risks, which is influenced by the extent to which the community is involved in decision-making processes and feels that its concerns are being addressed."], "gene-drive technology": ["A type of genetic technology that enables the spread of a specific genetic modification throughout a population, allowing for more effective and targeted control of invasive species by altering their behavior or fertility.", "A technology that enables the rapid spread of a genetically modified trait within a population, potentially allowing for the widespread control of invasive species without the need for continuous control measures.", "A technological approach that manipulates the genetic makeup of an invasive species to suppress its population, utilizing a self-sustaining mechanism to ensure its effectiveness and long-term applicability."], "genetic biotechnology": ["The application of cutting-edge genetic engineering techniques to introduce specific characteristics or traits into a species in order to control its population or behavior, often with the goal of mitigating the negative impacts of invasive or nuisance species.", "The manipulation of biological organisms' genetic material to achieve specific outcomes that aim to mitigate the negative effects of invasive species, such as the control of population sizes or suppression of their spread.", "The use of microorganisms or genes to control or manage specific organisms or ecosystems by altering their populations or behavior, often through the deliberate manipulation of genetic material."], "non-target taxa": ["Species or organisms that are not the specific target of a particular management or control measure, but could potentially be affected by its implementation or unintended consequences.", "Organisms not directly targeted by a biological control method, but that may potentially be affected or harmed by its implementation, often due to shared characteristics or ecological
