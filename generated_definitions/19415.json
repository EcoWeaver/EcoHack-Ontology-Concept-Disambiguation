facilitating the unintended and potentially invasive introduction of non-native species.", "Large hubs where sea-faring vessels frequent and engage in activities that facilitate the transfer of species from one region to another.", "Areas of intense maritime activity where large numbers of vessels frequent, facilitating the transportation of goods, people, and potentially invasive species
