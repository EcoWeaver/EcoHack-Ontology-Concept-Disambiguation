{"non-native species": ["Organisms introduced to a region or ecosystem through human activity, which have established a breeding population and can potentially cause harm to native species, their habitats, or the environment as a whole.", "Organisms that have naturally occurred in a specific geographic area, but have since been introduced, often accidentally or intentionally, by humans, and now inhabit the area outside their native range, potentially threatening local ecosystems and biodiversity.", "Species that have been introduced to an ecosystem outside their natural range, often as a result of human activity, and can potentially cause harm to the environment, economy, or human health."], "watch lists": ["A list of organisms of conservation concern, whose locations and populations need to be closely monitored to prevent or mitigate ecological harm, facilitating early detection and response to potential invasions or threats to native species.", "A compiled compilation of information on the current locations and trends of certain species, used to predict potential problems and take proactive measures to prevent harm or extinction.", "A tool for identifying and tracking the spread of potentially harmful or invasive species, enabling early detection and response measures to prevent ecological damage or disruption."], "early warning/rapid response system": ["A system designed to promptly identify and address the spread of potentially harmful organisms or events, allowing for timely interventions to mitigate their impacts and prevent irreparable harm to ecosystems or human societies.", "A proactive system that rapidly detects and responds to potential threats or changes in the environment, enabling effective conservation and management strategies to prevent the spread of invasive species and minimize their impacts.", "A proactive framework that alerts authorities to potential threats and enables swift, targeted actions to mitigate the impacts of invasive species, ensuring the timely preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem resilience."], "model generation": ["The creation of predictive representations of complex systems, simulating the potential spread or trajectory of non-native species, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning for management and mitigation.", "The process of developing a hypothetical representation of how invasive species might spread or behave in various environmental scenarios, often informed by historical data and expert knowledge.", "The creation of hypothetical scenarios or projections based on observed patterns and trends, used to predict and inform strategies for mitigating the spread and impact of non-native species."], "invasive species": ["A species that enters a new geographical area, often through human activity, and has a significant impact on the native ecosystem, potentially causing harm to the environment, economy, or human health.", "Non-native organisms that expand their geographic ranges and outcompete or displace native species for resources, disrupting ecosystem balance and potentially causing significant environmental harm.", "Non-native organisms that, once established in a new environment, threaten the native ecosystem by outcompeting native species for resources, altering habitats, and disrupting ecological balance, ultimately posing a significant risk to the environment, human health, and economic sustainability."], "data sharing": ["The act of granting access to or transmitting valuable information, such as geographic locations of species, to third parties while maintaining control over the level of specificity and detail provided.", "The process of making available for collective examination, interpretation, and utilization, spatially referenced information of various types, particularly with regard to the physical distribution and presence of species.", "The open and unrestricted distribution of raw or processed information, such as locations of non-native species, between individuals, organizations, or entities for purposes of analysis, study, or utilization, while ensuring that sensitive aspects of the data are protected and restricted to authorized parties."], "data sensitivity": ["The concern for protecting confidential or potentially harmful information contained within data, which may hinder its sharing or use due to fear of exposure or exploitation.", "The attribute of information that, if publicly disclosed, could potentially cause harm or discomfort to individuals, organizations, or ecosystems due to factors such as invasion of privacy, loss of trade secrets, or disruption of conservation efforts.", "The vulnerability of sensitive information that requires protection and restricted access to prevent unauthorized use, misuse, or disclosure, which can hinder the sharing of data for analytical purposes."], "quarter-quadrangle grid cells": ["A geographic division that enables the concealment of precise location data for sensitive information, while still allowing for aggregated analysis and mapping, by representing data as discrete, bounded areas with indistinguishable boundaries.", "A method of geographic data aggregation that divides a map into small, uniform rectangles that can contain sensitive information, allowing for the preservation of exact locations while still providing broad overview data.", "A specific, spatially-based unit of analysis that allows for the masking of sensitive location data while still enabling accurate mapping and data analysis, by converting precise geographic coordinates to a generalized format."], "": ["The practice of disclosing specific details of a particular type while concealing its exact whereabouts or identity, in order to preserve confidentiality or protect against unwanted attention.", "A level of awareness or attention required by some information or facts, which may not be publicly disclosed due to potential consequences or harm.", "The process of obscuring or disguising potentially harmful or confidential information in a dataset to protect its sensitive nature while still allowing its use for analysis."]}
