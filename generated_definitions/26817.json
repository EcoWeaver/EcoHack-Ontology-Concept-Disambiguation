structure and function, and potentially causing significant ecological and economic impacts."], "native herbivores": ["Organisms that naturally occur in a particular ecosystem and primarily consume the vegetation present in that ecosystem, showing a preference for non-native plant species that are not their traditional food sources.", "Organisms that are indigenous to a specific geographic region and consume plants, but do not share a direct evolutionary history with those plants, nonetheless exhibit a stronger preference for consuming non-native plant species over native plant

potentially limits the spread of invasive plant species."], "non-native plants": ["Plants that are not part of the natural plant community in a particular region and have been introduced by human

indigenous flora, potentially altering the native ecosystem's composition and dynamics."], "enemy release hypothesis": ["The theory that non-native organisms, free from the evolutionary pressures of their native predators, are less susceptible to predation and thus more likely to thrive and spread in their introduced range, often with detrimental consequences to native ecosystems.", "The notion that when a non-native plant species is introduced to a new environment, it will no longer face predators that have co-evolved with it, allowing it to thrive and expand its range without being constrained by its natural defenses, assuming it will not be replaced by native herbivores with similar predation habits.", "The phenomenon in which non-native plants are freed from the pressure of co-evolved herbivores and parasites that have evolved to feed on them in their native range, allowing the non-native plants to establish themselves and spread more easily in their new environment without the usual predation and competition."], "biotic resistance": ["The phenomenon where native organisms in an ecosystem exhibit a preference for non-native species over native ones, potentially restricting the establishment and spread of invasive species.", "The phenomenon where organisms native to an ecosystem tend to consume invasive species at a higher rate than native species, thereby mitigating the invasive species' ability to spread and establish themselves, and contributing to the maintenance of the ecosystem's original balance.", "The phenomenon where non-native organisms, introduced to an ecosystem, are more likely to be consumed by native predators than by native predators' coevolved prey, potentially limiting the invaders' spread and success."], "generalist crayfishes": ["A type of crustacean that consumes a wide variety of plant species, having no strong preference for one species over another within the same plant family.", "Aquatic crustaceans with broad dietary preferences that consume a wide range of plant species, including both native and non-native plants, with no strong affinity for a particular type of plant.", "Crustaceans that are not

flora species that have established themselves in a particular region, often having originated from a different geographical location, and are characterized by their novel presence and potential

alter the existing ecological balance and potentially outcompete native species for resources.", "Non-native plant species that have been introduced to a new region or ecosystem and have established a self-sustaining population, often altering the local flora and fauna in the process."], "native plants": ["Species that are natively associated with a specific geographic area and have co-evolved with

association with a specific plant species over a long period of time, such that the plant's chemical or structural defenses have been matched by the herbivore's adaptations to overcome those defenses, often resulting in a reciprocal and ongoing evolutionary arms race.", "Species that have evolved alongside a specific set of plants, often resulting in a mutualistic relationship where their feeding preferences, defense mechanisms, and ecological niches are intricately linked, making it more likely for them to prefer and utilize those particular plants over others.", "Organisms that, through a
