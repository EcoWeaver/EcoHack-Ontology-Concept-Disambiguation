native species, altering the delicate balance of Pacific island and atoll ecosystems.", "A non-native species of small to medium-sized social insects, commonly found in disturbed or altered ecosystems, that can outcompete native species for resources and habitat, and can cause significant ecological and economic impacts through their invasive behavior.", "A type of pest insect that originates from another region or continent, spreads rapidly, and often forms large colonies, dominating local ecosystems and disrupting the balance of native species, posing significant threats to biodiversity and ecosystem health."], "mutualistic Hemiptera": ["Species of insects that have a beneficial relationship with invasive ants, where the ants receive a benefit, such as food or shelter, and in return, provide a service or resource to the insects, facilitating their coexistence and potentially exacerbating the ecological impact of the ants.", "Insects that maintain a reciprocal beneficial relationship with invasive ants, often providing essential services such as food or protection in exchange for shelter, nutrients, or other benefits, thereby contributing to the success and

a system where one species provides a service or food source to the other."], "Pacific": ["A region characterized by a unique combination of islands, atolls, and oceanic environments, home to a diverse array of endemic and invasive species, including ants and their hemipteran mutualists, and often threatened by the introduction of non-native species.", "A geographical region characterized by archipelagos of islands and atolls that are home to a unique biodiversity of flora and fauna, often vulnerable to ecological threats such as invasive species.", "A vast and diverse region of the

agents into an ecosystem to control or eliminate a specific species or population, typically with the goal of minimizing crop damage or preventing the spread of disease."], "ecological thresholds": ["The minimum level of damage or disturbance to a ecosystem that is considered acceptable or manageable, above which the ecosystem's natural balance and function are disrupted, potentially leading to cascading effects and long-term harm.", "The point at which the impact of a pest population's density on its ecosystem's health and resilience becomes noticeable, requiring management actions to maintain balance and prevent degradation.", "The point at which the pressure or impact of a specific population or species on an ecosystem's health and balance reaches a level that compromises its
