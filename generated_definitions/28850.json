a given environment, such as varying water depths, substrates, and vegetative cover, that can influence the interactions between species and the effectiveness of predator-prey relationships."], "predator-prey interaction": ["The complex reciprocal dynamic between two species, where the larger or more formidable individual from one species, by feeding on or harassing the smaller or more vulnerable individuals of the other species, affects the behavior, survival, and reproduction of both species, ultimately influencing their population dynamics and ecological replacement.", "The complex dynamic between two organisms, where one exploits the other's presence, activity, or habitat for sustenance, growth, or reproduction, leading to alterations in behavior, population dynamics,

ultimately affecting the competitive balance between them."], "laboratory stream": ["A controlled, artificial aquatic environment, typically featuring a narrow, winding channel, which mimics the natural flow of a stream and is used to simulate and study the ecological interactions of organisms in a simplified, laboratory setting.", "A controlled, artificial environment designed to mimic the
