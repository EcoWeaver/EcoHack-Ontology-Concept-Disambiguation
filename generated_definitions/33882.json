species at a given site enhances the site's ability to resist the colonization of invasive species, thereby improving the long-term persistence of the native flora.", "The phenomenon where the early establishment of certain native plant species in a restored ecosystem creates a beneficial environment that reduces the likelihood of invasive species becoming established, by virtue of the native species' ability to outcompete or suppress the invaders through their rapid growth, biomass production, and complex interactions.", "The phenomenon by which a head start given to native plant species in restored ecosystems allows them to outcompete invaders and maintain dominance, thereby reducing the success of invasive species."], "species composition": ["The unique mix of different types of plants present in a restored native ecosystem, which can include a single dominant species or a diverse array of species that interact with each other to create a distinct community characteristic.",

present within a given area, measured in terms of the quantity of plant material."], "biomass production": ["The measure of the quantity of complex organic material produced by living organisms, such

community's ability to resist invasion by non-native species.", "The amount of organic matter produced by living organisms within an ecosystem, measured in terms of the total mass of structural components, such as stems, leaves, and roots, that are contributed by multiple species within a community."], "site clearance": ["The removal of vegetation, debris, and other obstacles to create a bare or minimally vegetated surface, allowing for the subsequent establishment of restored native plant species.", "The process of clearing away existing vegetation to prepare a site for ecological restoration or rehabilitation, allowing native species to establish themselves before invasive species can outcompete them.", "The removal or destruction of existing vegetation, debris, and potentially invasive species to prepare a site for the reintroduction of native plants or other ecological restoration activities, often necessitating immediate follow-up steps to establish a competitive advantage against subsequent invasions."], "revegetation": ["The process of re-establishing and diversifying the native plant population on a restored site through the intentional introduction of seedlings or mature plants, with the aim of rapidly establishing a resilient and competitive community that can hinder the establishment of invasive species.", "The process of
