energy-rich products of photosynthesis with its connected daughter plants, allowing them to thrive and grow, and potentially overcoming environmental constraints."], "biomass": ["The quantity of organic matter produced by a plant through photosynthesis, measured by its total dry weight or mass, which is a key indicator of the plant's overall health, growth, and reproductive success.", "The quantity of organic material accumulated by plants, which includes the weight of structural components, such as stems, leaves, and roots, as well as stored substances like starch, proteins, and fats.", "The accumulated quantity of essential organic materials produced by a plant, such as structural components, reproductive structures, and storage tissues, which collectively represent the plant's growth and development."], "tiller production": ["The process by which a plant produces new stems or growth points that emerge from the base of an existing stem, allowing for increased vegetation and growth, which can be influenced by the transfer of resources such as photosynthate.", "The process by which a plant creates new stems, potentially increasing its overall growth rate and biomass production, thereby enhancing its competitiveness in its environment.", "The production of new, above-ground shoots or stems that arise from the base of a plant, increasing its overall size and growth rate, and often serving to enhance its ability to capture light, absorb nutrients, and compete with neighboring organisms."], "parent-daughter ramet pairs": ["Clusters of genetically identical, connected, and nutritionally dependent organisms that form a single individual, wherein the more mature, established organisms supply resources to the younger, less developed ones, fostering cooperative growth and development.", "A collection of two plant individuals, genetically identical and connected by an underground stem, in which one plant serves as the source of nutrients and resources to the other plant, which is dependent on the transferred nutrients for its growth and development.", "A group consisting of two connected plant units, one produced by the division of a stem or stolons, and its original, genetically identical parent plant unit, which has shared resources with the new unit through a physical connection, enabling the exchange of photosynthates and
