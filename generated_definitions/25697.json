invasion by a specific gastropod species and exhibiting reduced levels of tributyltin (TBT) contamination.", "A north-western region in the Iberian Peninsula, known for its vulnerability to marine pollution and recent influx of invasive species, where reproductive anomalies have been observed in certain gastropod populations."], "invasive species": ["A non-native species that establishes a self-sustaining population in an ecosystem where it is not native, causing harm to the native species and ecosystem balance.", "A non-native, non-native-restricted species that exhibits uncontrolled population growth and expansion, often causing harm to the ecosystem and potentially altering its natural balance, and which has been introduced to an area through human activity or other means, resulting in competition for resources, predation, and habitat modification, ultimately threatening the biodiversity and ecological integrity of the affected region.", "A non-native species that has established a self-sustaining population in a new region, often with potential to outcompete and displace native species for resources and habitat."], "TBT bioaccumulation": ["The gradual and excessive accumulation of a particular toxic substance within an organism's tissues, often with detrimental effects on its reproductive and developmental processes, potentially resulting from environmental pollution and the substance's persistent presence in the ecosystem.", "The process by which certain substances, present in the environment, accumulate and concentrate within the bodies of certain organisms, potentially disrupting their reproductive processes and causing abnormal growth patterns.", "The process by which a toxic substance is taken in by an organism and stored in its tissues, potentially leading to adverse health effects, particularly when it affects the reproductive system, causing developmental abnormalities and reproductive impairment."], "pollution": ["A cumulative presence of substances originating from human activities, accumulated in the environment, and potentially causing harm to organisms, including disruptions to reproduction and development, thereby threatening the sustainability of ecosystems.", "The presence and accumulation of substances, substances of human origin, in the environment that disrupt or alter the natural biological processes, habitats, or ecosystems, potentially causing harm or adverse effects on living organisms.", "The phenomenon of chemical substances, including man-made and natural compounds, accumulating and being released into an environment at levels detrimental to the health and well-being of the living organisms that inhabit it, ultimately altering their natural behavior, development, and reproduction patterns."], "reproductive anomalies": ["A state of unconventional or abnormal developmental or reproductive patterns in an organism, characterized by variations from its typical or expected biological processes, such as the failure to lay viable eggs or the presence of unusual sex characteristics.", "Abnormalities in the natural process of reproduction, marked by irregularities
