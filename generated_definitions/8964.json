composition and functioning of native ecological communities, often with devastating consequences.", "The process by which non-native species spread to new areas, grow to high densities, and have significant and often destructive effects on the native ecosystems they colonize.", "The process by which non-native species spread to new areas, rapidly colonize and dominate ecosystems, and subsequently alter or eliminate the native biotic and abiotic components."], "personality-dependent dispersal": ["The tendency for individuals to exhibit distinct behavioral characteristics, such as sociality and boldness, which influence their likelihood of migrating to new areas, leading to a non-random colonization process.", "The phenomenon in which the tendency of an individual to spread to new areas is influenced by its distinct behavioral characteristics, such that certain behavioral traits are more common among dispersing individuals than among those remaining in their original location.", "The phenomenon where certain individual characteristics, such as temperament or social behavior, influence an organism's tendency to disperse from a population, potentially leading to the establishment of a biased subset of individuals in a new environment."], "dispersal tendency": ["The inclination of certain individuals to stray from their established group or population, often driven by their unique behavioral characteristics, and resulting in their migration to new areas.", "The natural inclination of an individual to migrate away from its initial habitat and explore new surroundings, which can vary greatly between individuals in a population and play a crucial role in the colonization and spread of invasive species.", "The inherent inclination of an individual to move away from its birthplace or initial habitat and settle in a new location, which can significantly influence the dynamics of a population's expansion and colonization of a novel area."], "sociability": ["The tendency to thrive in the company of others, characterized by a preference for proximity and interaction with conspecifics, often manifesting in social behaviors such as schooling or grouping.", "The inclination of an individual to interact with others, demonstrated through a tendency to exhibit cooperative or agonistic behaviors, which can influence its likelihood of exploration and dispersal.", "The degree to which an individual tends to interact and affiliate with others, demonstrated through behavior such as schooling, pairing, or other social behaviors."], "boldness": ["The degree to which an individual is willing to venture into unfamiliar or potentially threatening environments, exhibiting a propensity to take risks and engage in bold or unconventional behavior.", "The propensity to take risks and venture into novel environments, characterized by a willingness to confront unfamiliar surroundings and challenges without undue apprehension or hesitation.", "A tendency to engage in novel and potentially threatening environments without hesitation, demonstrating an inherent confidence in one's ability to navigate and cope with uncertainty."], "activity": ["The propensity of an individual to engage in movements, actions, and interactions that contribute to its overall dynamism and involvement in its environment.", "The level of energetic expression exhibited by an individual in its exploration and interaction with its environment, influencing its tendency to engage in movement and exploration of new surroundings.", "The extent to which an individual mosquitofish engages in spontaneous, volitional movement, as opposed to staying in one place or being passively transported."], "exploration tendency": ["The inclination to investigate and engage with novel environments and stimuli, potentially indicating a willingness to venture beyond familiar surroundings.", "The propensity of an individual to venture away from familiar environments and engage in novel or untested situations, as characterized by their tendency to move off a known route or seek out new hiding places.", "The innate inclination of an individual to actively seek out novel environments, objects, or experiences, often characterized by a willingness to take risks and venture beyond familiar territories, influencing its tendency to disperse and interact with its surroundings."], "ecological implications": ["The long-term consequences of a non-native species spreading to a new area, characterized by changes to the local ecosystem's structure, function, and resilience, potentially leading to significant and often negative effects on the native species, habitats, and ecological processes.", "The potential consequences and effects on the structure and functioning of ecosystems and species interactions resulting from the actions and characteristics of invasive species, which can manifest in altered population dynamics, changes to community composition, and modified resource availability.", "The indirect, far-reaching consequences of an ecological event or phenomenon on the composition, structure, and functioning of an ecosystem, ultimately affecting its overall resilience and capacity to support biodiversity."], "invasion front": ["The edge of a territory or ecological community where non-native species are actively expanding their range, with a higher concentration of individuals dispersing away from their established populations.", "The boundary or edge where a non-native species, having spread to a new area, continues to expand its range and establish a presence, often characterized by a concentration of individuals and potential for further dispersal.", "The zone of rapid expansion and colonization of a non-native species into a new ecosystem, characterized by the increased likelihood of encountering individuals exhibiting distinct behavioral profiles, which in turn can influence the trajectory and ecological consequences of the invasion."], "colonists": ["Organisms that participate in the initial establishment of a non-native population in a new environment, marking
