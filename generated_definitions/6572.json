species consumes and utilizes the energy and resources of another species, often with a distinct feeding pattern and consumption rate, that can have significant cascading effects on the invaded community's structure and dynamics.", "The process by which an organism exploits another organism's resources, often involving the capture, consumption, or manipulation of its prey, with significant effects on the populations and communities involved.", "The process by which a species consumes and removes other organisms from its environment, often leading to a cascade of effects on the affected ecosystem, exemplified by the consumption of prey at a greater rate by a particular invasive species compared to native species."], "prey": ["The specific organisms or substances consumed by amphipods as a source of energy or nutrients, playing a crucial role in shaping the ecological dynamics of freshwater communities.", "The primary objects of consumption or predation that are attacked, devoured,
