permafrost, limited accessibility, and a unique biodiversity, where international travelers may potentially introduce non-native species through their activities.", "The northernmost and coldest regions of the Earth, characterized by harsh climate conditions, limited vegetation, and unique ecosystems, which are fragile and vulnerable to human activities that may inadvertently introduce non-native species.", "A remote and sensitive region of extreme northern latitude, characterized by a harsh climate and unique ecosystems, where the introduction of non-native species poses a

latter.", "The measures taken to prevent the unintentional transfer of microorganisms or other species from one geographic location to another, potentially altering the native ecosystem and causing harm to the environment, human health, or the economy."], "footwear disinfection": ["The process of reducing the microbial load on the outer surfaces of items worn on the feet, typically by immersing them in a chemical solution or substance designed to eliminate or significantly decrease the presence of microorganisms, in an effort to prevent the potential transfer of non-native species to sensitive environments.", "The practice of using a sanitizing solution to treat the surface of lower extremity items worn on the feet, typically prior to and after coming into contact with remote or sensitive environmental areas, in order to reduce the transfer of microorganisms from one location to another.", "The process of treating the surface of a portable, wearable object with a chemical or physical agent to reduce or eliminate the presence of microorganisms on its surface, typically prior to or following contact with an external environment, in order to prevent the potential transmission of microorganisms to that environment."], "broad spectrum disinfectant": ["A type of disinfectant that can effectively eliminate a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, typically used in situations where the potential for contamination is high and the introduction of foreign species needs to be prevented.", "A chemical solution designed to effectively destroy a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, that can contaminate surfaces and equipment, thereby ensuring a high level of sanitization and reducing the risk of disease transmission.", "A type of antimicrobial agent that has the ability to eliminate a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, from surfaces and objects."],

biosecurity protocols to prevent the introduction of non-native species to sensitive ecosystems.", "A broad-spectrum disinfectant commonly used in environmental hygiene to eliminate a wide range of microorganisms, often applied as a foot bath to reduce microbial contamination on footwear.", "A broad-spectrum disinfectant commonly used to sanitize footwear and other surfaces, effective against a wide range of microorganisms and microorganisms' byproducts."], "foot bath": ["A shallow, usually movable container filled with a disinfectant solution, through which a person must pass, often as a pre-cautionary measure to prevent the spread of unwanted microorganisms.", "A process of brief exposure of footwear to a broad-spectrum disinfectant solution before landing at a remote site, intended to reduce the likelihood of transferring microbial contaminants to the natural environment.", "A shallow, chemical-treated platform that passengers step through as a disinfection measure to reduce microbial load on footwear before entering a sensitive environment."], "expedition cruise ship": ["A specially designed watercraft that travels to remote and often pristine regions, typically operated
