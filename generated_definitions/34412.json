and other behavioral interactions with non-reproductive females."], "host-parasite behavior": ["The tactics employed by a species to gain dominance over and occupy the social structure of another species, often involving manipulation of individuals or reproductive strategies, which ultimately allow the dominant species to exploit the resources and reproduction of the host species.", "The manner in which an entity that relies on another for survival or shelter interacts with that other entity in order to gain access, exploit, or coexist with it, often involving strategies to evade or circumvent defenses, and influenced by the degree to which the entity has evolved to specialize in a particular relationship.", "The complex interactions and adaptations exhibited by certain organisms that allow them to infiltrate and potentially takeover the social structure of another species, often characterized by specialized behavioral and physiological traits that facilitate successful integration and suppression of the host's defense mechanisms."], "invasion success": ["The ability of a parasitic insect to successfully establish itself within the social structure of its host insect's colony, often by exploiting specific behaviors or vulnerabilities of the host, and ultimately achieve reproductive dominance.", "The degree to which a parasite is able to gain entry into and establish itself within the social hierarchy of its host's nest, without encountering significant resistance or aggression from the host colony's members.", "The measure of an obligate social parasite's ability to enter and establish itself within a host colony without being detected or resisted by the host's queen or worker bees."], "laboratory colonies": ["A controlled artificial environment containing a social group of insects, maintained and manipulated for scientific research purposes, and characterized by a defined composition of individuals, including a queen and workers,
