{"semi-natural habitats": ["Areas characterized by a balance between natural and human-influenced processes, often featuring a mix of native vegetation and introduced elements, which support a diverse range of plant and animal species.", "Areas where human activity has been minimized, allowing natural processes to occur alongside human-managed elements, resulting in ecosystems that are both modified and yet still retain aspects of their original character.", "Environments where natural processes and human influences intersect, resulting in a blend of wild and managed characteristics, often featuring a mix of native and non-native plant species, and potentially undergoing periodic changes in vegetation and structure."], "meadows": ["Natural grasslands with mixed vegetation, often situated near bodies of water or in transitional zones, providing a diverse environment for various plant and animal species to coexist.", "Natural grasslands with rich soil, typically found in areas with moderate climates, characterized by a mixture of herbaceous vegetation and varied topography, providing a habitat for a diverse range of flora and fauna.", "Grassland habitats with minimal human intervention, characterized by a mix of herbaceous plants and potentially small shrubs, often situated near water bodies, and supporting a diversity of flora and fauna."], "bog springs": ["Shallow, natural sources of freshwater emerging from the ground in a saturated, acidic environment, often surrounded by specific vegetation and playing a crucial role in shaping local ecosystems.", "Areas where freshwater collects on the surface, often surrounded by acidic and low-oxygen conditions, frequently found in environments with peat formation and characteristic vegetation.", "Shallow, surface water outlets from an acidic, peat-rich wetland ecosystem, characterized by slow-moving or still water, and a dominance of sphagnum mosses and other acid-loving vegetation."], "water bodies": ["Areas of naturally occurring standing or flowing liquid, often characterized by a boundary with adjacent land, and providing a habitat for various plant and animal species.", "Areas that support aquatic life, including but not limited to slow-moving or standing bodies of water, such as ponds, lakes, or wetlands, where plants and animals can thrive alongside natural flows of water.", "Permanent or temporary pools of still or slowly moving water, such as ponds, lakes, or streams, that border or surround areas of natural vegetation."], "taxa": ["A classification system that groups related species based on their physical and biological characteristics, with the groups ranked in a hierarchical manner to distinguish between categories of increasing specificity.", "A group of organisms classified together based on their shared characteristics, which are used to distinguish them from other groups, allowing for the understanding of their evolutionary relationships, geographic distribution, and ecological niches.", "A specific category of classification, often considered subordinate to a primary group, distinguished by shared characteristics that differentiate it from other similar groups, used to organize and describe the diversity of living organisms."], "lower rank": ["A categorization of a taxon, typically applied to distinguish between geographic or ecological forms of a species, where the subcategories are considered to be a lesser level of distinction compared to the species itself.", "A classification of a species into smaller groups that provide further detail about its characteristics, distribution, or taxonomy.", "A classification level within a taxonomic hierarchy that designates a subspecies or a more specific grouping within a species, which exhibits distinctive characteristics or features that distinguish it from other groups of the same species."], "European localities": ["Geographic regions or areas where a specific plant species has been observed, recorded, and mapped.", "Geographic regions or specific sites within those regions where a particular species has been observed and recorded to occur naturally or have been introduced, as documented in a scientific study or report.", "Specific geographic points or areas where a particular plant species has been observed and documented to exist within a particular continental region, typically marked by coordinates or written descriptions."], "upland": ["A elevated and relatively dry region of varied terrain, often characterized by gentle slopes and studded with vegetation, where the landscape rises above the surrounding areas to create a subtle, rolling landscape of hills and valleys.", "A region characterized by its relatively flat and elevated terrain, often featuring a mix of vegetation and water bodies, and typically found in the higher elevations of a mountainous or hilly area, where the environment is relatively stable and conducive to the growth of specific plant species.", "A region of gently rolling hills or low-lying mountains that is characterized by a temperate climate, moderate elevations, and a mixture of grasslands, forests, and wetland habitats, often supporting a diverse range of plant and animal species."], "Western Carpathian Mts.": ["A mountainous region in Central Europe known for its diverse flora and fauna, extending from the Carpathian Basin in the east to the borders of the Alpine foothills in the west.", "A mountain range located in Central Europe, characterized by a diverse array of flora and fauna, and featuring varied landscape and geological features that have supported the existence of a species previously unknown in the region until recent discovery.", "A mountain range in Central Europe, known for its diverse geological and ecological features, and home to a wide range of flora and fauna, including newly discovered localities of Glyceria striata."]}
