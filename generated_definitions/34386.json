yielding spatially-referenced information on the distribution, abundance, and spread of a targeted organism, in this case the spotted lanternfly.", "Data collected from systematic observations and

and spread of a particular species or phenomenon.", "Information gathered through systematic and observational efforts to record and measure specific characteristics of a phenomenon in a particular region or area, providing a comprehensive overview of its distribution, behavior, and spread over a designated period."], "risk": ["The likelihood of an unwelcome change occurring in a specific geographic area, such as an increase in population or spread of an invasive species, due to factors such as human activity or natural events.", "The likelihood that a specific geographic area will be affected by a non-native species' colonization due to the cumulative influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors.", "The likelihood of a geographic area being colonized or infested by a non-native species, particularly when influenced by human activities, which may lead to the spread of the species beyond its initial point of introduction."], "long-distance dispersal": ["The unplanned or intentional transportation of an invasive species over a significant distance, typically beyond its natural range, resulting in the establishment of a new population, often facilitated by human activities.", "The movement of a species across significant distances, likely facilitated by external factors such as environmental currents or human activity, allowing it to rapidly colonize new areas and expand its range.", "The process by which a non-native planthopper migrates considerable distances between regions, potentially exceeding 55 to 92 kilometers per year, without being accompanied by human movement or direct activity."], "short-distance dispersal": ["The process by which individuals of a species move between nearby locations, often facilitated by environmental factors or human activities, and play a significant role in the initial stages of an invasion.", "The movement of the spotted lanternfly at distances that are relatively small compared to the overall extent of its invasion range, allowing it to spread rapidly within local areas through a combination of natural and human-mediated factors.", "The process by which an insect's geographic range expands gradually, typically over a relatively short distance, through a combination of natural processes, such as wind currents and animal movement, rather than sudden, long-range jumps."], "radial rates of spread": ["The rate at which the boundary of a spreading phenomenon moves away from its central point, measured by the average distance it advances in a specific direction, often indicating the pace of expansion or propagation.", "The rate at which the boundary of an area affected by a non-native planthopper advances outward in a circle, representing the distance it travels in a specific direction from a central point or point of origin, typically measured annually over a specified period.", "The measure of how quickly the boundaries of an invasive species' territory expand outward from a central point, indicating the speed at which the species is spreading into new areas."], "human-aided dispersal": ["The unintentional or intentional transportation of an organism from one location to another by humans, often facilitated by human activities such as trade, travel, or recreational activities, thereby increasing the probability of its successful establishment in a new
