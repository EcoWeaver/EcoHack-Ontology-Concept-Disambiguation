changes and potential damage to the plant, thereby affecting its growth, development, and overall health."], "plant tolerance": ["The ability of a plant to adapt to and recover from damage caused by insect herbivory, without a significant reduction in its ability to grow and reproduce, as observed through changes in plant morphology and physiological responses over time.", "The ability of a plant to withstand and recover from harm caused by external factors, such as insect herbivory, without exhibiting significant physical or reproductive damage, allowing it to maintain its overall fitness and competitiveness.", "The ability of a plant to withstand and continue to grow after suffering physical damage, without exhibiting significant changes in its overall health or reproductive capacity,

changes in its physiological and morphological traits, thereby allowing it to persist and thrive in the presence of grazing insects.", "The ability of a plant to withstand or deter damage inflicted by an external agency, as characterized by its capacity to adapt and maintain its physiological and morphological integrity in response to stressors.", "The ability of a plant to deter or withstand damage caused by insect herbivory, manifesting in various physiological and morphological responses that compromise the herbivore's ability to consume or survive on the plant."], "native habitats": ["Ecosystems that have evolved over time without intentional human introduction of non-indigenous species, providing a natural environment for indigenous plants and animals to thrive.", "Areas where local vegetation has evolved over time without significant influence from introduced species, which are often characterized by a distinct set of native plant species that have co-evolved with native insects, and play a crucial role in sustaining local ecological balance and biodiversity.", "Areas of land that have historically and naturally supported a unique set of plant and animal species, often shaped by geological, climatic, and evolutionary processes, and are now protected to preserve their ecological integrity."], "invasive potential": ["The tendency of a non-native plant species to rapidly expand its range and displace native vegetation, potentially outcompeting indigenous species for resources and altering the ecosystem's structure and function.", "The tendency of a non-native plant species to thrive and spread quickly, potentially outcompeting native vegetation and altering ecosystem dynamics, as influenced by its biological characteristics and environmental factors.", "The propensity of a non-native plant species to rapidly expand its range and displace native vegetation, facilitated by its ability to survive and thrive under varying environmental conditions and resist herbivory and competition."], "Melanoplus grasshoppers": ["A type of insect that feeds on the leaves of certain grasses, including ornamental grasses, and is often used as a biological indicator to assess the invasive potential of these plants in protected areas.", "A type of insect commonly found in areas where non-native grasses have been introduced, which has been used as a means of assessing the ability of various cultivars of these grasses to resist damage and thrive in the face of herbivory.", "A type of grasshopper known for its ability to consume and damage the leaves of certain grass species, playing a crucial role in shaping the response of these grasses to herbivory and their potential to become invasive."], "plant responses": ["The complex array of physiological and growth modifications exhibited by plants as a result of insect herbivory, which may include changes in tolerance, resistance, or overall adaptation to damage, and can vary in magnitude and pattern

sustained injury, characterized by changes in its physiological traits and growth patterns.", "The adjustments made by a non-insect part of a plant in reaction to the consumption or damage caused by an insect, which can include changes in its ability to resist or tolerate such damage."], "low-risk invaders": ["A type of non-native species that poses a relatively minor threat to native ecosystems and biodiversity, exhibiting limited ability to displace or harm native species and habitats, making them suitable for coexistence with native communities.", "Species of non-native plants that have a limited ability to cause ecological harm, primarily due to their inability to quickly adapt to and withstand damage caused by herbivores, allowing for effective monitoring and control measures to be implemented in protected areas.", "A type of non-native plant species that is capable of expanding its range and invading native habitats, but is unlikely to significantly disrupt the ecological balance or biodiversity of protected areas and native ecosystems, despite its ability to tolerate and resist herbivory and environmental stresses."], "biotic resistance": ["The natural defense
