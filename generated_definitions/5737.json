{"plant diseases": ["A condition in which a crop's normal growth, development, or physiological processes are impaired or altered by the presence and actions of specific microorganisms, which exploit and manipulate the plant's biological systems to their advantage.", "Peculiar afflictions caused by micro-organisms that manipulate host tissue to impede plant defenses and promote the growth of the infecting agent.", "A condition characterized by the invasion and exploitation of plant tissues by microorganisms, resulting in altered plant growth, development, or productivity, often with detrimental consequences for plant health and agricultural productivity."], "pathogen growth": ["The successful establishment and proliferation of a microorganism within a host environment, allowing it to maintain its presence and potentially cause disease.", "The establishment and maintenance of a microbial entity's presence and influence within the tissue of a host organism, enabling it to utilize host resources and evade host defense mechanisms.", "The ability of a micro-organism to increase its population and expand its territory within a host organism, often by exploiting vulnerabilities in the host's immune system and manipulating host cellular processes for its own benefit."], "crop species": ["The specific groups of domesticated plants that are cultivated and harvested for food, fiber, or other purposes, with a focus on those that are most vulnerable to disease-causing microorganisms.", "Plants cultivated and harvested by humans for food, fiber, or other economic purposes.", "Plants widely cultivated for human consumption or other practical uses, whose diseases and well-being are crucial for global food security."], "plant infection": ["The process by which a plant pathogen establishes itself within the plant's tissues, deploying specialized proteins to manipulate the plant's defenses and promote its own growth and survival.", "The process by which a fungal pathogen establishes a state of damage and disarray within the tissue of a plant, permitting the spread of fungal growth and the exploitation of plant resources for its own survival and reproduction.", "The process by which a micro-organism, such as a fungus, colonizes and exploits a plant, leading to suppression of the plant's immune response and supportive growth of the micro-organism within the plant tissue."], "host cells": ["The cells of a living organism that provide nutrients and shelter for the growth and development of a foreign entity, allowing it to exploit the host's resources and potentially cause harm.", "Cellular units that are responsible for maintaining the structure, function, and homeostasis of an organism, which are targeted by effector proteins released by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae to manipulate plant tissue and facilitate infection.", "The cells of a plant that provide the environment and sustenance for the growth and development of a pathogenic micro-organism."], "biotrophic interfacial complex": ["A specialized structure comprising a plant-derived membrane-rich component that forms at the site of interaction between fungal invasive hyphae and host cells, serving as a primary location for the accumulation of cytoplasmic effector proteins during plant infection.", "A novel plant membrane-rich structure that serves as a primary destination for the delivery of effector proteins during plant infection, allowing the pathogen to manipulate host cellular processes and promote its own growth.", "A complex network of plant cellular structures and membranes that forms at the site of invasion by the rice blast fungus, where it accumulates effector proteins to facilitate disease development."], "invasive hyphae": ["A type of fungal structure that enables the fungus to penetrate and colonize plant tissue by secreting proteins that interact with and modify the host cells, allowing for the fungus to establish a persistent and intimate relationship with the host.", "A type of fungal structure that is associated with the formation of a specialized plant-fungal interface, characterized by the delivery of effector proteins from the fungus into the plant cell, thereby facilitating the manipulation of the plant's immune response and promoting fungal growth.", "Branched fungal extensions that traverse host tissue, enabling the delivery of secreted proteins into various compartments, including the host cell interior and extracellular space, thereby facilitating the pathogen's ability to suppress host immunity and promote its own growth."], "exocyst components": ["A set of molecular machinery responsible for coordinating the release of proteins into the extracellular environment, playing a crucial role in facilitating the invasive process of pathogens by targeting specific structures during plant infection.", "Proteins involved in the outer edge of the secretory pathway, playing a crucial role in targeting effector proteins to the plant cell membrane during the biotrophic interaction between the rice blast fungus and its host.", "A group of molecules that play a crucial role in facilitating the release of specific proteins from a fungal pathogen into a plant cell during infection, allowing the fungus to establish a stable interaction with the host."], "secretory pathway": ["The process by which a microorganism directs the movement of certain proteins from its inner cellular compartments to its outer surface or exterior environment, allowing these proteins to exert their biological effects on host cells or the surrounding medium.", "The process by which microorganisms deliver specific proteins, known as effectors, outside of their own cells to manipulate the environment and facilitate the establishment of infection in host tissues, relying on specialized molecular machinery to traverse cell membranes and achieve precise targeting.", "The process by which a pathogen transfers proteins into the environment surrounding its host cells or directly into those cells, allowing it to manipulate the host's immune response and support its own growth."]}
