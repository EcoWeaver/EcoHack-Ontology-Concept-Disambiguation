result of favorable environmental conditions or the absence of significant inhibitory factors.", "The process by which an organism's size, shape, or physical characteristics increase or develop over time, as measured through changes in stature, leaf or blade length, root length, or total biomass.", "The process by which seedlings or established plants increase in size, mass, or development in response to environmental conditions, including the presence or absence of chemical compounds produced by other plants, such as extracts of Plantago virginica."], "seedlings growth": ["The process by which the initial stages of a plant's development after germination, characterized by the emergence of the first leaf or set of leaves, are impacted and influenced by the presence of certain substances, such as extracts, produced by another plant species.", "The initial stages of vegetative development in plants, characterized by the emergence of stems and leaves from seeds, where the
