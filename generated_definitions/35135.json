the potential harm it poses to the local ecosystem."], "native": ["Plants or vegetation that have evolved and grown in a particular region or ecosystem over a prolonged period, and are characteristic of that specific environment.", "Plants that are originally from a particular region and have been present there for a significant amount of time, naturally growing and reproducing without human introduction or significant human intervention.", "Organisms that have been geographically resident and established in a specific region for a sufficient period of time to have developed adaptations and populations that are characteristic of that region, and are not intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans."], "invasive species": ["A non-native organism that has established a presence in a new geographic area, where it can disperse and expand its range, potentially causing harm or disruption to the local ecosystem, native species, and human activities.", "An non-native organism that has established a reproducing population in an ecosystem where it is not naturally found, capable of causing significant harm to the environment, economy, or human health, and often spread rapidly through human activity or natural means.", "An alien organism that thrives in a foreign environment, where it can rapidly colonize and expand its range, often with devastating consequences for native species and ecosystems."], "host": ["A living thing on which another organism, in this case an insect, relies for nourishment or reproduction, often at the expense of the host's well-being or survival.", "A specific species of plant that provides sustenance and a reproductive environment for a particular insect species, allowing the insect to survive, develop, and disperse.", "A species whose tissues are specifically utilized by an invasive insect for nutrition, often resulting in significant harm or mortality to the host organism."], "cactus pads": ["The flattened, leaf-like structures that grow from the stems of certain types of succulent plants, providing a food source for a newly introduced moth species that has become a significant pest in Florida.", "The flattened, segmented stems of a certain type of flowering plant, which serve as a habitat for a specific species of moth that consumes them.", "The section of a certain type of succulent plant, characterized by a flat, fleshy structure, which serves as the plant's primary means of reproduction and is often targeted by a specific invasive insect."], "egg sticks": ["Structures formed by a female moth as a means of holding multiple eggs, often aligned in a linear or clustered pattern, which are an essential part of her reproductive strategy and play a crucial role in the dispersal and establishment of the moth's populations.", "A grouping of multiple, generally small and fragile, structures deposited by an insect onto a surface, serving as a repository for the insect's reproductive units.", "The reproductive structures of a specific species of insect, attached to a substrate and containing numerous eggs, serve as a dispersal mechanism for the insect's offspring, influencing the spread and distribution of the insect within its habitat."], "mortality rate": ["The proportion of a specific category of organisms (in this case, cactus pads or growth) that fail to survive over a specified period, often due to factors such as predation, disease, or environmental stress.", "The proportion of cactus pads that fail to thrive or succumb to damage inflicted by the activities of a certain insect, leading to a decrease in the overall size or viability of the cactus population over time.", "The proportion of cactus plants that cease to thrive or die due to the feeding activities of a specific insect species over a given period, resulting in a reduction of their overall population over time."], "recruitment": ["The process by which new individuals of a population emerge or are added, typically through the growth of seedlings or young plants that are susceptible to mortality or damage, ultimately affecting the overall density and
