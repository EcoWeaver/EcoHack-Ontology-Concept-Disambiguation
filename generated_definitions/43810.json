potential long-term coexistence or dominance, as influenced by climatic and geographic factors.", "The evolutionary and ecological progression of non-native species as they adapt to and expand within a new environment, characterized by distinct phases of growth, colonization, and adaptation, with varying degrees of population establishment and spatial distribution."], "colonization": ["The process

potential for further population growth.", "The initial process of establishing a foothold in a novel environment, marked by a rapid expansion of suitable habitat, which ultimately enables a species to reach its full invasive potential.", "The process by which a species initially spreads and establishes itself in a new environment, often characterized by a rapid increase in its geographic range

species demonstrates a distinctive and advantageous adjustment to local environmental conditions, resulting in increased fitness and survival rates within a specific geographic region.", "The process by which populations of a non-native species, over time, develop unique characteristics that enable them to thrive in specific geographic areas, often as a response to local environmental conditions or predation pressures.", "The process by which a species modifies its ecological characteristics to suit the unique conditions of a specific region, resulting in increased population persistence and reproductive success within that area, and demonstrating a departure from the typical ecological dynamics of the species as a whole."], "sink stage": ["A stage in the colonization process of an alien species where populations are unable to sustain themselves and persist due to unfavorable environmental conditions, often resulting in a lack of long-term viability.", "The condition where populations of an alien species struggle to survive and maintain their presence in an area, often due to unfavorable environmental conditions or lack of necessary resources, resulting in a decline of the population over time.", "The stage in which invasive populations remain isolated or disconnected from their original habitat, often experiencing reduced fitness or declining populations due to limited resources, competition, or other environmental pressures."], "quasi-equilibrium stage": ["A state in which invasive populations exhibit stability and consistency in their distribution, density, and composition, characterized by a lack of significant changes over time, despite potential disturbances and ecological pressures.", "A stage of an invasive species' population where a majority of individuals occupy a specific ecological niche, having reached a balance with their environment, characterized by a relatively stable and self-sustaining presence, with populations adapted to the local conditions.", "A state of ecological stability in which a non-native species' populations have achieved a relatively stable balance with their environment, despite still having some room for growth or expansion."], "niche": ["The specific combination of environmental conditions, including factors such as climate, temperature, and humidity, that define a species' ability to survive and thrive within a particular geographic region, and which can be used to predict the potential distribution and spread of that species.", "The specific combination of environmental conditions and biological requirements that a species needs to survive and thrive, often visualized as a multidimensional space where various factors are plotted against each other.", "The specific combination of environmental conditions and resource availability that a species requires to survive and thrive, which can be visualized as a multidimensional space of potential distribution."], "geographic space": ["The area of physical and environmental conditions that determines the distribution of a species, encompassing the various locations where it can potentially thrive and survive.", "The totality of physical areas where a species can potentially reside, encompassing all sites that satisfy the specific environmental conditions necessary for the species' survival and reproduction.", "The three-dimensional representation of the physical environment, encompassing the terrestrial and aquatic regions, encompassing factors such as altitude, latitude, and longitude, where biological species can inhabit and interact with their surroundings."], "climatic niche": ["The concept of a species' specific environmental requirements, encompassing the ideal conditions under which it thrives, and the spatial arrangement of these conditions that dictate its distribution and potential colonization areas.", "The specific combination of environmental conditions, such as temperature and precipitation, that a species is adapted to occupy and thrive in, determining its distribution and potential for spread.", "The multidimensional space of environmental conditions in which a species is able to survive and reproduce, defining its potential distribution and limiting its geographic spread."], "Hutchinson's duality": ["The notion that small, seemingly insignificant areas within a species' niche can be transformed into vast, influential geographic ranges, providing a framework for understanding the complex relationships between an invasive species' distribution and its potential for expansion.", "The correlation between the specific conditions necessary for a species to thrive and the physical space in which it occupies, highlighting how small, unique areas in which a species is well-suited can correspond to larger, widespread areas in the real world.", "The principle that the relationship between a species' climatic niche and its geographic distribution is such that small variations in the former can correspond to large variations in the latter, influencing the potential expansion of invasive species."], "Fabaceae": ["The family of flowering plants that includes beans, peas, and lentils, commonly introduced as non-native species in new regions.", "The family of flowering plants characterized by pea-like seeds and trifoliate compound leaves, including several species that have become naturalized in foreign environments.", "A family of flowering plants commonly referred to as legumes, characterized by their ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain bacteria, which enables them to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form, and often exhibiting compound leaves and brightly colored flowers."], "Central Chile": ["A semi-arid to temperate region with Mediterranean-type climate and a mixture of Andean and Pacific coastal influences, characterized by a unique vegetation and fauna, and located at the geographical intersection of two great mountain ranges, where the influence of the Humboldt and the Ferrel gyres plays a significant role in shaping its climate and ecosystems.", "A region characterized by a Mediterranean climate
