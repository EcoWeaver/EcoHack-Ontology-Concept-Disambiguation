{"biological invasions": ["The process by which non-native species spread and establish themselves in a new region, displacing native species and altering ecosystem dynamics, often facilitated by human activity and described mathematically using the diffusion equation.", "The uncontrolled and often unforeseen expansion of non-native species into a previously unaffected ecological niche, driven by factors such as diffusion-like processes and complex interactions with the environment.", "The unwanted and often rapid dispersal of a non-native species into a new ecological environment, characterized by a competitive advantage over native organisms, with potential consequences for ecosystem structure and function, which can be quantified and modeled using mathematical frameworks, such as the diffusion equation."]}
