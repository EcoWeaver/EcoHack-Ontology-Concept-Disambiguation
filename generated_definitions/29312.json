constrain or enhance the harvest of a specific type of wildlife.", "The conditions or influences that affect the living organisms and their habitats, including weather patterns, land use, and other external stimuli that can shape the behavior, population dynamics, and overall well-being of species."], "economic factors": ["The conditions that govern the allocation of resources and the decision-making processes of entities involved in the sale and purchase of a natural resource, influencing the quantity of that resource that is extracted or harvested.", "The influence of monetary values and market forces on the quantity of a specific resource or commodity being harvested or utilized.", "The combination of market pressures and incentives that influence the quantity of a particular resource, such as a harvested animal, based on its perceived value and alternative uses, shaping the decisions of individuals or organizations involved in its extraction or management."],

Australia.", "The amount of atmospheric water that falls to the ground in a particular area during a specific time period, measured as a cumulative quantity that affects the suitability of land for livestock grazing.", "The quantitative measurement of atmospheric water vapor condensed and falling to the ground, influencing the availability of resources for a particular ecological system."],

services to account for inflationary fluctuations in a given region.", "A widely recognized and regularly updated measure of the average change in the cost of a basket of common goods and services, used to compare the purchasing power of currency over time, thereby providing a key indicator of inflation and economic fluctuations, which is often employed as a proxy to measure the changing value of goods and services in a specific region.", "A widely followed indicator of the general price level of goods and services in a country, which is used to adjust economic data to account for inflation and changes in the cost of living, thereby providing a more accurate picture of trends and fluctuations in the commercial wildlife harvest."], "Western Australia": ["A vast, semi-arid region in southwestern Australia, characterized by rangelands where approximately 1 million feral goats are annually harvested for commercial purposes, with a unique combination of environmental and economic factors influencing the size of this harvest.", "A vast, arid region in southern Australia characterized by a semi-arid rangeland ecosystem and a major hotspot for commercial harvesting of a particular type of feral ungulate.", "A vast semi-arid region in the southwestern part of a large island-continent, characterized by a hot and arid climate, where a significant annual harvest of a non-native, herbivorous mammal species takes place, primarily for economic gain."], "semi-arid rangelands": ["A vast, dry region characterized by limited rainfall and sparse vegetation, yet supporting a remarkable biodiversity of wild herbivores, where human activities like commercial harvesting of native species have significant ecological and economic implications.", "Landscapes characterized by limited vegetation and water availability, where grasslands and open woodlands dominate the landscape, with sparse vegetation cover and low precipitation levels, often supporting adapted animal populations that are tolerant of dry conditions.", "A region characterized by an area of land where dry conditions prevail for most of the year, with limited vegetation growth due to limited water availability, yet still supports a diverse range of wildlife species."]}
