increases in overall fitness.", "The extent to which a population's characteristic traits are distributed and represented among its members, allowing for flexibility in responding to environmental pressures and adapting to new conditions.", "The inherent variability among individuals within a population or species, measured by the number of different genetic markers, the frequency of each marker, and the degree of variation between them."], "invasion": ["The rapid and successful dispersal and establishment of a non-native species in a new geographic area, often resulting in significant ecological and environmental impacts, where the species' genetic makeup and adaptations enable it to thrive in the new environment.", "The process of colonization and spread of a non-native organism

thrive in its new environment.", "The process by which a non-native species successfully establishes and expands its range in a new area, often exhibiting increased adaptability and reproductive potential, driven by sufficient genetic variation and effective gene flow."], "Rhododendron ponticum": ["A highly invasive, flowering plant species that has expanded its range to non-native areas, maintaining a significant level of genetic diversity, likely due to gene flow from multiple founding populations, allowing it to adapt to new environmental conditions.", "A highly invasive, adaptable

diversity while expanding its range and adapting to new environmental conditions."], "population": ["A group of individuals of the same species that live in a specific geographic area and interbreed, resulting in a shared gene pool that is distinguishable from other groups of the same species.", "A group of individuals of the same species that live in a specific geographic area and may interbreed with one another, but are isolated from other groups of similar individuals in the same or different areas.", "A grouping of individuals from a common ancestral pool, characterized by a specific geographic location and limited gene flow, thereby allowing the accumulation of genetic differences over time, which enables the adaptation to local environmental conditions."], "selection": ["The process by which the characteristics of a population or species are influenced and shaped by the presence of suitable genetic variation, allowing individuals with traits better suited to their environment to become more prevalent over time.", "The process by which certain characteristics in a population become more prevalent over time due to their favorable interaction with the environment, allowing the population to thrive in its new surroundings.", "The natural process by which the most well-suited individuals within a population have a greater chance of survival and reproduction, leading to the accumulation of adaptations that enable them to thrive in a specific environment."], "gene flow": ["The uninterrupted movement and distribution of genetic material from one population to another, ensuring that a sufficient amount of genetic variation is preserved and allowing for the adaptation of the invading population to new environmental conditions.", "The process by which genetic information is dispersed throughout a population, ensuring that individuals retain a broad range of characteristics necessary for adapting to changing environmental conditions, thereby facilitating the species' ability to thrive in its new habitat.", "The process by which individuals with diverse genetic traits move from one population or group to another, contributing to the sharing and maintenance of genetic variation within and between populations, thereby promoting the adaptation of populations to new environmental conditions."], "founder effects": ["The loss of genetic diversity that occurs when a small, non-representative sample of a population moves into a new area, resulting in a reduced gene pool and potential maladaptation to the new environment.", "The phenomenon where the initial colonization of a new area by a population results in a significant loss of genetic variation, as only a limited number of individuals or a single clone introduces the genetic material to the new location, leaving behind a subset of the original genetic diversity.", "The phenomenon by which a small number of individuals from a single source population establishes a new population in a different location, resulting in a reduction of genetic diversity and a greater likelihood of inbreeding, as genetic variations that were once present in the original population are lost or become less common in the new population."], "genetic drift": ["The random fluctuation in the frequency of a gene variant in a population, occurring when a small group of individuals establishes a new population, potentially leading to a loss of genetic variation and increased uniformity within the new population.", "The loss of genetic variation in a population that occurs randomly, regardless of the adaptation of individuals to their environment, resulting in a decreased ability of the population to adapt to future changes.", "The natural process by which small, newly formed populations may become reproductively isolated and experience a loss of genetic variation as a result of chance events, resulting in a reduced ability to adapt to changing environments and resist extinction."], "genetic distances": ["The numerical measure of the average degree of differentiation among populations, reflecting the degree to which they have diverged from a common ancestral gene pool.", "A measure of the closeness or dissimilarity between different groups or individuals within a population or species, calculated by analyzing the patterns of variation in their genetic material.", "A measure of the extent to which populations of the same species exhibit unique combinations of genetic traits, providing insight into their evolutionary distinctiveness and potential for adaptation to changing environments."], "differentiation": ["The measure of how distinctly distinct populations of a species become over time, indicating the degree to which they diverge in their genetic composition, resulting in unique characteristics that set them apart from one another.", "The process by which a plant population becomes increasingly distinct from its relatives, reflected in the degree to which the population's genetic makeup diverges from that of other populations, resulting in distinct characteristics or traits.", "The extent to which distinct groups within a species exhibit unique characteristics, often indicating the development of distinct populations over time, but not necessarily accompanied by significant physical or behavioral changes."], "refugium": ["A geographical area where the population of a species has maintained a high level of genetic diversity and has acted as a source for re-colonization and migration to other areas, playing a crucial role in the species' evolutionary adaptation to changing environmental conditions.", "A region or area where a species has persisted with a high level of genetic diversity, likely due to its protected or isolated environment, which serves as a reservoir for the species' genetic material and allows for the maintenance of its evolutionary potential.", "A region or area that has preserved a high level of genetic diversity within a species, likely due to its remote location or historical isolation, and serves as a source of genetic material that can be used by the species as it expands its range into

interactions, that influence the distribution, growth, and survival of an organism within a specific geographic area.", "The complex interactions between biological organisms and their surroundings,
