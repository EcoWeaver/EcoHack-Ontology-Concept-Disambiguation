brought into a new geographic area by humans, often resulting in competition with native species for resources and potential disruption of the ecosystem balance.", "A living organism that has moved into a new geographical area, often as a result of human activity, and establishes itself in a population where it did not previously exist."], "invasive species": ["Organisms introduced to an ecosystem, where a small proportion exhibit rapid population growth, spread to new areas, and outcompete native species for resources, causing significant harm to the ecosystem's biodiversity and ecological processes.", "Organisms introduced from one region to another that, often unintentionally, cause significant disruption to ecosystems and pose a threat to native biodiversity, even if they have not yet reached a large population size or caused extensive damage.", "A type of non-native organism that, once introduced to a new environment, rapidly spreads and colonizes areas where it was previously unknown, potentially causing significant harm to native ecosystems and biodiversity."], "species traits": ["Unique characteristics that define an organism's physiological, ecological, and evolutionary properties, which can influence its likelihood of thriving in a new environment.", "The inherent characteristics of a biological entity that determine its potential to thrive and persist

group of organisms and can be used to predict their behavior, ecology, or impact on their environment after introduction to a new location."], "plants": ["Organisms characterized by photosynthetic capabilities, multicellularity, and a sessile life cycle, playing a crucial role in shaping ecosystems and providing ecosystem services, which are frequently included in studies examining biological invasions and biodiversity.", "Organisms that are often the focus of investigation in the context of biological invasions, serving as a contrast to other groups, such as fungi, to predict the likelihood of species becoming invasive after introduction.", "Organisms with complex, stationary bodies that carry out photosynthesis, playing a key role in maintaining ecosystems and supporting life on Earth."], "animals": ["Organisms that are multicellular, eukaryotic, and lack a cell wall, typically characterized by mobility, respiration, and a wide range of physiological and behavioral adaptations.", "Organisms that are often the focus of conservation efforts and are commonly investigated in studies on biological invasions, typically characterized by complex body structures, varied sensory capabilities, and reproductive strategies that involve gametes.", "The group of organisms that are often studied in the context of biological invasions and management efforts to focus on species with a high likelihood of becoming invasive, typically in contrast to plants."], "fungi": ["Microorganisms that are typically non-motile, filamentous, and produce spores, often living in symbiotic relationships with other organisms, playing important roles in decomposing organic matter, interacting with plants and animals, and having the potential to cause significant harm or disruption to ecosystems when introduced to new environments.", "Microorganisms that obtain their nutrients by decomposing organic matter or by forming symbiotic relationships with plants and animals, and are known for their importance in decomposing organic matter and in causing plant diseases.", "Organisms that belong to a group of organisms typically found in soil, plants, and decaying organic
