sparse or absent, in order to alter the environment and promote the growth of desired plant species."], "grazing": ["The controlled introduction of a subset of herbivorous organisms to a specific area to mimic a natural process that was disrupted or altered by human activity.", "A deliberate act of selectively removing and consuming a portion of vegetation from a controlled area, typically achieved
