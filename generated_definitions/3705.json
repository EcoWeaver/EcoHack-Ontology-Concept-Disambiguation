population structure analyzed to understand its invasion patterns and potential routes of spread."], "woolly apple aphid": ["A species of small, sap-sucking insect that infests apple trees and was first detected as a non-native pest in eastern China during the early 20th century, but has since spread to other regions of the country.", "A type of tiny, invasive, plant-sucking insect that was first detected in certain regions of China during the early 20th century and has since spread to many other areas, causing concern for its potential impact on local agriculture and ecosystems.", "A small, sap-sucking insect native to Europe, first introduced to China in the early 20th century and now widely distributed throughout the country, characterized by its distinctive woolly coating and significant impact on apple orchards."], "invasive species": ["A population of a non-native species that has established itself in a new geographic area, often resulting in significant ecological and economic impacts, and can spread rapidly through a region or country, with genetic analysis revealing a distinct departure from the genetic structure of the native population.", "A species that has colonized and established a presence in a new geographic region, often with significant ecological and economic impacts, through human-mediated or natural dispersal, and has the potential to outcompete native species for resources and habitat, causing shifts in ecosystem dynamics and potentially leading to detrimental consequences for the native biodiversity.", "A non-native organism that has established a self-sustaining population in a region, often through human activity, and threatens to cause harm to the environment, economy, or human health by outcompeting native species for resources, altering ecosystems, or spreading disease."], "microsatellite loci": ["Small, repetitive sequences of nucleotides found in the DNA of an organism, which serve as distinct genetic markers to identify and differentiate individuals, populations, and species.", "A set of specific, short DNA sequences that serve as genetic markers, allowing researchers to analyze and compare the genetic diversity and structure of populations, thereby identifying possible migration routes and origins.", "A type of genetic marker that consists of repeating sequences of nucleotides, used to analyze the genetic variation and population structure of a species by comparing the specific patterns of these repeated sequences between different individuals or populations."], "genetic diversity": ["The extent to which the unique combinations of tiny biological building blocks present within a group of organisms vary and differ from one another.", "The degree to which the genetic makeup of a population or species is rich in variety, characterized by a mixture of unique and similar traits among its individuals, and resulting in a complex web of relationships between genetic factors that determine the population's adaptation, fitness, and potential for evolution.", "The degree of difference in inherited characteristics within a population, resulting from the presence and combination of various gene variants, which enables the population to adapt to its environment and respond to selection pressures."], "genetic structure": ["The distribution of genetic variation among groups of individuals or populations, characterized by the proportion of shared genetic material, genetic distance, and the presence of distinct clusters or subgroups.", "The pattern of relationships among the unique variations within a population, revealed through the analysis of inherited traits, indicating the degree of connectivity and ancestry among individual organisms.", "The distribution and relationships among different groups of organisms, as measured by their genetic similarities and differences, that can provide insights into their evolutionary history, migration patterns, and geographical dispersal."], "STRUCTURE software": ["A computational tool used to identify the number of genetically distinct groups within a population and determine the degree of admixture between these groups, enabling researchers to reconstruct the demographic history and infer the relationships between different populations.", "A computational tool used in population genetics to identify and analyze genetic clusters, allowing researchers to distinguish between genetically distinct groups within a population and understand the possible origins and dispersal patterns of organisms.", "A computational tool used to identify and analyze the genetic groups within a population or group of populations, allowing researchers to reconstruct the evolutionary history and migration patterns of the species being studied."], "genetic cluster": ["A distinct grouping of individuals within a population, characterized by their shared genetic characteristics, such as similar DNA patterns or inherited traits, which suggests a common ancestral origin or recent migration.", "A group of genetically similar individuals or populations that share a common ancestral lineage, often with reduced genetic diversity and gene flow with other groups.", "A group of organisms that share a distinct set of genetic characteristics, indicating a common ancestry or recent migration from a shared source population, and are distinguishable from other groups through analysis of their DNA sequences."], "supercolony": ["A large and homogeneous population of genetically identical or near-identical individuals, characteristic of a recent invasion, likely resulting from a single introduction event.", "A geographically extensive and reproductively interconnected population of a species, comprising multiple distinct local populations that exhibit low genetic structure and high gene flow, resembling a single, large, and cohesive group.", "A genetically homogeneous population of a species that covers a large geographic area and lacks significant genetic subdivision, often indicating a single, ancient founding event."]}
