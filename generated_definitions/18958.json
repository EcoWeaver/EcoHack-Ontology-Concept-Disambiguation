"The duration for which a non-native plant has continuously occupied a specific area, from its initial arrival to its current presence."], "common ragweed": ["A species of annual or biennial weed that has been known to migrate and establish populations in new regions, leaving behind a trail of older populations that have undergone phenotypic changes as a result of its invasion process.", "A weedy species of annual plant native to Europe and Asia, widely dispersed and established in new environments through human activities, characterized by rapid growth and reproduction, allowing it to adapt and thrive in varied ecological settings.", "A perennial weed native to North America, widely distributed through human activity, and characterized by its ability to adapt and change phenotypically over time, exhibiting distinct traits depending on its age and establishment location."], "invasive species": ["A plant species that, having been introduced to a new region or ecosystem, has become established and is now capable of spreading rapidly and causing harm to native vegetation and ecosystem function through competition, predation, or other means.", "A species that is introduced to a new environment through human activity or natural means, subsequently establishes a self-sustaining population, and causes significant harm to the native ecosystem, often by competing with native species for resources or altering the environment in a way that has negative impacts.", "Organisms that have been introduced to a new environment by human activity and have spread beyond their original range, often outcompeting native species for resources and disrupting ecosystem balance."], "exotic species": ["A type of species that originates from outside a region's natural boundaries, often introduced by human activity, and can potentially alter the native ecosystem's balance and diversity.", "A species that has been introduced, often unintentionally, to a region outside its natural geographic range, often through human activity, and has established a reproducing population.", "A species that originates from a different geographic region and becomes established in a new territory, often through human activity, exhibiting characteristics that are adapted to its new environment and potentially outcompeting native species for resources."], "invasion history": ["The documented account of a non-native plant's spreading and establishment in a specific geographic area over time, including the timing and location of colonization, population growth, and distribution, which allows researchers to analyze patterns and trends in its adaptation and evolution.", "The record of a non-native species' sequential establishment and spread over time and space, including the duration of presence at each location, providing a chronological context for understanding the evolution of the species' characteristics.", "The chronological record of the spatial and temporal progression of a non-native species as it establishes and expands its territory over time, allowing for the tracking of its developmental stages, environmental interactions, and population dynamics."], "population": ["A group of organisms that share a common history and genetic makeup, having been established at a specific location at a particular point in time, and exhibiting distinct characteristics that have evolved in response to their environmental conditions and selection pressures.", "A distinct group of organisms, such as plants or animals, that have descended from a common ancestor and share similar characteristics, which have been shaped by the time and location they spent in a particular environment.", "A distinct group of individuals of the same species that inhabit a specific area and share a common history, exhibiting a unique set of characteristics that differentiate them from other groups with different histories."], "maternal effects": ["The phenomenon whereby characteristics or traits inherited from an individual's parental generation continue to influence the growth, development, and performance of offspring, even after separation from their parental environment.", "The influence a parent's characteristics, particularly those of the female parent, has on the physical and biological traits of its offspring, which can impact an individual's performance or fitness in its environment.", "The influence of an individual's mother or ancestral source on the characteristics, behavior, or performance of their offspring, where the impact is mediated through environmental and/or genetic factors inherited from the mother during reproduction, but is not solely determined by the individual's own genetic makeup."], "traits": ["The measurable characteristics or attributes that distinguish an individual or group of organisms from others, influencing their interaction with their environment and success in reproducing.", "Characteristic features or attributes of an organism's physical appearance, physiology, or behavior that determine its ability to adapt to and interact with its environment.", "The distinctive characteristics or
