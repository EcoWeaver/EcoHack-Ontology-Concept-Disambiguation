contributed to the introduction, thereby shedding light on the routes and timing of their spread."], "transport pathways": ["The routes and mechanisms through which non-native species are introduced and dispersed to a new region, potentially leading to the establishment of invasive populations.", "The specific routes or channels through which organisms spread from their native habitats to non-native regions, often facilitated by human activities, and resulting in the introduction of alien species into new environments.", "The routes or channels through which non-native species, introduced from their original habitats, move from their points of origin to a new location, influencing the genetic makeup and population dynamics of the receiving ecosystem."], "incursions": ["The introduction of non-native organisms into a population or ecosystem through intentional or unintentional means, resulting in the potential for establishment and spread.", "The initial appearance or introduction of a non-native species into a new geographic location, typically through human activity or natural dispersal, marking the beginning of its potential establishment and spread.", "The
