a unique process involving the manipulation of air currents, facilitating the dispersal of the material over long distances."], "wind": ["A measurable natural phenomenon that occurs when air particles in a specific direction are rapidly displaced, creating a continuous flow that can be controlled and manipulated in a constructed tunnel to estimate the dispersal parameters of plants and other biological entities.", "A force that moves in a continuous, invisible flow, generated by the movement of gases in the atmosphere, capable of exerting varying degrees of force on physical objects,
