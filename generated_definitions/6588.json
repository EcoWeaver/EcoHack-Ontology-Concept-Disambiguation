prioritize their structural development."], "growth rate": ["The measure of how rapidly a plant's mass, volume, or biomass increases over a given period, often influenced by factors such as environmental conditions, competition, and genetic predisposition, which is critical in determining its ability to colonize new areas and outcompete native species for resources.", "The rate at which a plant accelerates its development and expansion, characterizing its ability to adapt and thrive in various environments, and potentially influencing its capacity to outcompete other species and occupy new habitats.", "The rate at which an organism increases its size or mass over time, allowing it to grow and expand its physical presence."], "size": ["The maximum extent or measure of an organism's physical attributes, such as mass, volume, or spatial dimensions, that contribute to its overall capacity to produce offspring or resist environmental stressors.", "The capacity of an organism to occupy a certain amount of space or to exhibit a particular measure of bulk, which can influence its ability to compete for resources and interact with its environment.", "The physical characteristic of a plant that is often associated with its ability to outcompete others for resources, particularly light and space, in its environment, and which is often linked to its capacity for growth and reproduction."], "fitness": ["The inherent capacity of a plant species to produce offspring or propagate itself in a given environment, thereby increasing its representation and potentially outcompeting other species.", "The degree of success an individual plant exhibits in its ability to produce and disseminate its genetic material, ultimately determining its relative abundance and persistence in its environment.", "The inherent ability of an organism to successfully propagate and thrive in its environment, thereby maximizing its ability to reproduce and spread."], "biogeographical factors": ["The spatial and environmental characteristics of a region that influence the characteristics and behaviors of species that inhabit it.", "Factors that describe the geographic distribution and patterns of species occurrence and evolutionary history, particularly with respect to latitude, longitude, climate, vegetation types, and geographic barriers, which may
