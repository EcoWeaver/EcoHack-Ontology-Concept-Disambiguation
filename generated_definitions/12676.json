and establishment of non-native grass species, which may include reduced productivity, increased costs, or altered market dynamics.", "The effects of the presence and proliferation of non-native

country where a significant proportion of the world's most invasive alien grass species have become naturalized.", "A unique and ecologically rich region characterized by a high concentration of non-grass species and a remarkable level of plant endemism, featuring an assemblage of exotic and invasive grass species that have established themselves through human introduction and subsequent spread.", "A unique and diverse temperate shrubland ecoregion, characterized by a high concentration of endemic plant species, and supporting a distinctive assemblage of flora and fauna, where invasive alien grasses are particularly widespread and problematic."], "pasture research stations": ["Sites where scientists experiment with cultivating and evaluating non-native plant species, often with the goal of determining their potential as forage or feedstock for livestock, and testing their adaptability to local environments.", "Controlled environments where agricultural experts test and evaluate non-native plant species for potential use as livestock feed or fodder, often with the goal of determining their suitability for local conditions.", "Facilities that conduct experiments and trials to assess the suitability and effectiveness of various plant species for use in agricultural grazing areas, often with the goal of improving forage quality, quantity, and sustainability."],
