human intervention, with the goal of preventing ecological harm and restoring native species dominance in a specific geographic area.", "The targeted removal of non-native organisms that are not yet

cooperation among multiple stakeholders to achieve successful outcomes.", "A targeted initiative aimed at removing and displacing non-native plant species that have been introduced to an island ecosystem, in order to prevent their naturalization and potential negative impacts on the environment, with the goal of restoring the island's native biodiversity and ecological balance.", "Initiatives aimed at permanently removing non-native species from specific areas of land, typically on a small scale, to prevent potential environmental harm and mitigate ecological disruption."], "potentially invasive species": ["A species that, although currently restricted to controlled areas and not yet widespread, has the capacity to spread beyond its introduced range and potentially cause ecological or economic harm if left unchecked.", "A species that, if introduced to a new ecosystem, may potentially cause harm or disrupt the balance of the environment, posing a threat to native species and ecosystem integrity, but has not yet established a significant population or distribution in the affected area.", "Species that, although currently restricted to specific areas and not yet widely established, have the capacity to spread and cause harm to the environment, human activities, or native ecosystems if not effectively managed or controlled."], "seed banks": ["A type of biological repository that allows a population to persist and regenerate, making it more challenging to completely eliminate a species.", "A permanent and continuous reservoir of viable propagules, originating from an invasive species, which has the potential to resurge and re-establish the infestation even after initial eradication efforts.", "A residual collection of viable reproductive units left behind by a removed invasive species, capable of regenerating the population if environmental conditions are conducive."], "land owners": ["Those individuals or entities that possess or control a specific geographic area, typically possessing the authority to grant or deny permission for activities such as ecological management or research to be conducted on their land.", "Individuals or entities having legal title, tenancy, or usufruct rights to the soil or physical territory on which a specific area or parcel of land is situated, influencing decisions related to the management and
