abundance, and distribution of organisms in a given area."], "native plant species": ["Plants that are indigenous to a particular region or area, having evolved over time in that specific environment, and are typically found in a given ecosystem before the introduction of non-native species.", "The types of flora that are indigenous to a particular region, having evolved and adapted over time, and characterized by a natural and intrinsic presence in the local ecosystem.", "Plants that have evolved and thrived in a particular region over a long period, and are naturally occurring and well-established in that area, often serving as a foundation for local ecosystems."], "cover": ["The extent of the land occupied by a particular plant species, measured by the proportion of the area where it is found, often used as a proxy for its density and abundance in a given region.", "The proportion of a given area that is obscured or shaded by the presence and growth of a specific plant species or vegetation.", "The measurement of the extent to which a specific plant species, in this case the invasive croftonweed, is present in a given area, indicating the degree of its colonization or dominance over native vegetation."], "richness": ["The measure of the variety of native plant species present in a given area, reflecting the degree to which the environment is composed of a diverse range of plant species.", "The variety or abundance of distinct native plant species within a specific area, often serving as a measure of ecological diversity.", "The variety and number of native species present in a given area, particularly in terms of the extent to which these species contribute to the ecological integrity and biodiversity of the environment."], "elevation": ["The measure of a site's proximity to the land's surface, which can influence the characteristics and distribution of the native plant species present, and was found to be negatively correlated with the
