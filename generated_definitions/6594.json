populations.", "The assemblage of species within the order Hymenoptera, specifically the family Formicidae, which inhabit the Caribbean region and are characterized by a unique distribution and evolutionary history.", "The collective group of ant species and subgenera that inhabit a specific region in the Caribbean, characterized by a shared evolutionary history and geographic distribution."], "Dominican amber": ["A type of fossilized tree resin that originated in the Dominican Republic, dating back to the late Oligocene or early Miocene era, which has preserved the remains of ancient ant species and subgenera, providing valuable insights into the history of ant evolution and extinction patterns.", "Fossilized tree resin from the Caribbean region, specifically the island of Hispaniola, which dates back to a geological period between 30 and 23 million years ago and contains preserved species of ants that were abundant during that time.", "A fossilized tree resin originating from the region of the Caribbean's largest island, which preserves the remains of ancient ants and provides a geological window into the evolutionary history of the local ant fauna."], "late Oligocene": ["A geological period characterized by a distinct transition in the Earth's flora and fauna, marked by the dominance of ancient families of plants and animals, occurring roughly 23-30 million years ago.", "A period of geological time approximately 28-25 million years ago, characterized by the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, significant changes in the Earth's climate, and the emergence of various species that would eventually give rise to the diverse flora and fauna of the modern Caribbean region.", "A geological epoch during which the ancestors of certain ants, now found in the West Indian ant fauna, existed in amber deposits of the Dominican Republic."], "early Miocene": ["A geologic era characterized by the formation of rich amber deposits in the Dominican Republic, during which the west Indian ant fauna was present and partially preserved for millions of years, serving as a fossil record for the evolution and distribution of these insects.", "A geologic period characterized by the emergence of mammals, gradual cooling of the Earth's climate, and the establishment of many modern terrestrial ecosystems, roughly 23-16 million years ago.", "A period in the Earth's geological history when many ancient ant species were preserved in amber, serving as a snapshot of the fauna in the West Indian region before the dawn of modern times, with most of these ant species subsequently becoming extinct."], "New World tropics": ["The geographic region characterized by a distinct set of biotic and abiotic conditions that has been historically separated from other regions by geographic barriers, featuring a unique array of fauna that has evolved independently and is composed of species with a shared ancestral origin.", "A region characterized by a specific set of climatic and ecological conditions, featuring a unique array of flora and fauna that have evolved over millions of years, with a geographical distribution spanning a vast area from the southern United States to northern South America, including islands in the Caribbean Sea.", "The region characterized by its unique assemblage of flora and fauna that evolved in isolation from their Old World counterparts, following the separation of the continents during the Cenozoic Era."], "Hispaniola": ["A significant island in the Greater Antilles, where a significant portion of the ant fauna found in the surrounding amber deposits has persisted over millions of years, and where modern ant species have restored the original number of genera and subgenera present during ancient times, except that the species found in the amber are extinct.", "The third-largest island in a Caribbean archipelago, where the fauna of ants exhibits a unique pattern of invasion and extinction patterns, as evident from ancient amber deposits.", "The island in the Greater Antilles where 22 genera and subgenera of a particular type of insect have persisted to the present, despite a significant number of extinctions elsewhere, and where 15 new genera and subgenera have colonized since the time of amber."], "extinction rate": ["The proportion of distinct lineages or populations that cease to exist over a given period of time, often as a result of environmental or ecological factors, and which is inversely proportional to their adaptability, specialization, or ability to migrate to new areas.", "The proportion of previously existing forms within a defined group that have ceased to thrive or exist at a particular location or region over a specified period of time, often resulting from a combination of factors including evolutionary adaptations, ecological niches, and migratory patterns.", "The proportion of a specific group of organisms that become permanently absent from a particular geographic area over a specified period of time, often resulting in a significant reduction in biodiversity."], "colonizing ability": ["The intrinsic capacity of an organism or group to successfully disperse, establish, and adapt in new geographic locations over time, driven by factors such as adaptability, resourcefulness, and ability to cope with environmental pressures.", "The capacity of a group or species to adapt to and successfully establish populations in new geographic regions, often resulting from a combination of factors such as dispersal mechanisms, ecological tolerance, and competitive advantages.", "The capacity of a biological group to successfully establish populations in novel environments and propagate through subsequent generations, thereby expanding its geographical range."], "species": ["A distinct evolutionary lineage characterized by a unique combination of physical and behavioral traits that has evolved separately from other similar lineages over a significant period of time, often with its own geographical distribution and ecological niche.", "A distinct category of biological organisms that exhibit a unique combination of physical and behavioral characteristics, are typically reproductively isolated from other similar groups, and are often represented by a specific type of fossilized remains in ancient deposits.", "The smallest unit of biological classification that has undergone a specific historical colonization event, possessing distinct morphological and ecological characteristics that have been preserved across time and geographic distance, while also exhibiting an innate ability to adapt and disperse in response to environmental pressures."]}
