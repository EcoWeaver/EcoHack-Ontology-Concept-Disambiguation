its resources, such as growth, reproduction, and maintenance, to optimize its survival and reproductive success in response to changing environmental conditions.", "A set of characteristics, including growth rates, longevity, and size, that influence a plant's ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions and propagate successfully in its introduced or native range, ultimately affecting its invasive potential."], "plant invasion": ["The process by which a non-native species, initially introduced to a new environment through human activity or natural dispersal, establishes a self-sustaining population and begins to expand its range, potentially outcompeting native species and altering ecosystem dynamics.", "The process by which a non-native species gradually becomes established and spreads throughout a new region, often outcompeting native species for resources and habitat, with the potential to alter the local ecosystem's composition and function over time.", "The process by which a plant species, initially introduced to a new geographic area, expands its range and adapts to local environmental conditions, ultimately becoming established and spreading beyond its initial introduction, often leading to ecological and environmental changes."], "water availability": ["The degree to which a plant's access to moisture is limited by environmental conditions, such as soil dryness or competition from other plants.", "The measure of the ease with which plants can access the liquid substance necessary for photosynthesis and other biological processes, varying in quantity and quality across different environments.", "The relative scarcity or abundance of a crucial resource that affects the growth, development, and survival of organisms, influencing their adaptability to environmental conditions and ability to thrive in different ecological niches."], "Lythrum salicaria": ["A Eurasian flowering plant known for its ability to adapt its growth patterns in response to environmental changes, exhibiting a shift from a fast-growing, small-statured strategy in ideal conditions to a slower-growing, longer-lived strategy in more stressful

distinctive response to changes in water availability, characterized by increased longevity and decreased overall size as it colonizes more stressful habitats.", "A flowering plant species native to Europe, known for adapting its growth habits to thrive in increasingly stressful environments as it expands its range."], "habitat": ["The specific combination of environmental conditions, such as moisture levels, that influence the growth, survival, and reproductive success of a particular organism in a given area.", "The location where an organism grows and develops, characterized by a specific set of environmental conditions, such as temperature, moisture, and light, which influence its survival, growth, and reproduction.", "The environment or conditions in which a plant lives, characterized by factors such as water availability, which can influence the plant's growth and development."], "secondary phase": ["The stage of a plant species' expansion beyond its initial introduction, characterized by adaptation to new environmental conditions and the development of strategies that enable it to thrive in more challenging habitats, ultimately leading to increased competitiveness and potentially widespread dominance.", "The stage of a plant's expansion process where it adapts to and thrives in previously unfavorable environments, characterized by a shift in life-history strategy that enables it to persist and potentially spread further.", "The period of an invasive species' spread beyond its initial introduction point, during which it adapts to new environments by changing its physiological or morphological characteristics to optimize its survival and reproduction in those environments."], "mesic habitats": ["Environments where vegetation is supported by a moderate to low level of moisture, but with limited to no standing water, allowing for a balance between water availability and drying conditions that favors certain plant species.", "Environments characterized by a moderate level of moisture availability, which can be achieved through a combination of adequate water supply and efficient water use, enabling plant species to thrive in a range of ecological niches.", "Habitats characterized by moderate moisture levels, often occurring in areas with a balance between aquatic and terrestrial conditions, where plants must adapt to varying degrees of water availability."], "native range": ["The geographic area where a plant species first evolved and initially established itself before being introduced to other regions, often characterized by its ancestral habitat and environmental conditions.", "The region where a species has its original, established distribution before human activity introduces it to a new environment, resulting in an altered or expanded range.", "The original geographic area where a species first evolved and developed its characteristic traits, providing a baseline for comparing its adaptations and behaviors in other environments."], "invaded range": ["The area where a non-native species, having initially established a foothold, has expanded and become established, characteristically exhibiting distinct adaptations and ecological dynamics compared to its native range.", "The geographical area where a non-native plant species has become established and spread, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering ecosystems, and is characterized by populations exhibiting adaptations to local environmental conditions that are different from those in the species' native range.", "The area where a non-native species has established a population and is thriving, often exhibiting a distinct ecological footprint that differs from the original native ecosystem."], "invasive species": ["A non-native organism that, when introduced to a new region, tends to exhibit a gradual transformation in its characteristics as it adapts to the local environment, potentially leading to a greater competitive advantage in more stressful or resource-limited habitats.", "A non-native species that has adapted to occupy a specific environment in a new geographical range, often exhibiting a change in its life-history strategy in response to varying conditions, resulting in a potential increase in its success and potentially outcompeting native species.", "A plant population that has expanded its geographic range beyond its native territory, occupying new habitats and potentially outcompeting native species for resources, and whose biology and ecology have adapted to
