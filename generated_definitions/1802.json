["The accumulation and growth of material generated by the living tissues of a plant, resulting from the conversion of sunlight, water, and nutrients into organic matter, which can be measured by its mass or quantity.", "The process by which plants transform chemical energy from sunlight and nutrients into a tangible, organic matter that serves as a measure of their growth and vitality.", "The process by which organisms convert energy and nutrients into a tangible, quantifiable entity, which can be measured as a growth or accumulation of mass, often in response to environmental stimuli or management techniques."], "plant cutting": ["The intentional disruption of a plant's aboveground or belowground biomass through mechanical or manual means to either reduce its size, disrupt its root system, or dispose of unwanted material, often performed as a management strategy to control or eliminate invasive species.", "The process of manually or mechanically removing and dividing portions of a plant's aboveground or belowground biomass, often as a means of controlling its growth or reproduction.", "The removal of a portion of a plant's aerial parts, typically for purposes such as waste disposal or invasive species control, often followed by mechanical disruption of the remaining plant material."], "season": ["The period of time characterized by distinct climate patterns, growth
