development of new structures, such as shoots, leaves, and roots."], "soil": ["A type of underground environment that is often characterized by a mixture of decaying organic matter, minerals, and gases, and is capable of influencing the growth of certain plants through the regulation of water availability and chemical composition.", "The upper layer of the ground that is saturated with water, affecting the growth and development of plant life by influencing the availability of air, water, and nutrients, and characterized by its unique chemical composition and physical properties.", "The substrate in which roots of plants grow, characterized by the presence of porewater that affects the availability of essential nutrients, and can influence plant growth and survival by affecting the accumulation of toxic substances."], "porewater sulfide concentrations": ["The level of a toxic substance dissolved in water that seeps through the ground and surrounds the roots of plants, potentially harming their growth.", "The amount of a particular chemical compound present in the water that fills the spaces between soil particles, which can affect the ability of plants to grow in a given area.", "The level of toxic chemical compounds dissolved in the water between soil particles that can harm plant growth, particularly in areas where the soil is saturated with water for an extended period."], "salinity": ["The measure of the concentration of dissolved particles, mostly derived from seawater, that affects the suitability of an environment for plant growth.", "The measure
