pathogens and other foreign substances that enter its body, thereby protecting it from infection and disease.", "The complex network of biological mechanisms that enable an organism to resist or respond to foreign substances, such as parasites or diseases, by recognizing and eliminating or neutralizing them through a process of activation, replication, and elimination of specialized cells and substances.", "A natural defense mechanism that equips an organism to recognize and combat foreign entities, such as parasites, by mounting a targeted response to eliminate or neutralize the threats before they can cause harm, allowing the organism to maintain homeostasis and resist subsequent infections."], "lungworm": ["A type of microscopic invertebrate that parasitizes the respiratory system of certain vertebrates, typically inhabiting the lungs or airways, and is transmitted through environmental contamination or direct contact.", "A type of parasitic organism that feeds on the respiratory systems of certain vertebrates, and is typically transmitted through the environment, where it can potentially decimate native populations if left unchecked.", "A type of parasitic worm that infests the lungs of certain amphibians, often causing significant harm to their hosts, and which has been shown to decline in native populations coinciding with the arrival of an invasive species."], "cane toads": ["A type of invasive anuran that, while often viewed as a pest due to its impact on local ecosystems, has been found to inadvertently decrease the parasite burdens of native anurans by serving as a host that prevents the development of certain lungworm larvae.", "Large, invasive amphibians originating from the Americas, known for their potential to reduce parasite burdens of native frog populations by providing a novel habitat for certain parasites that fail to develop in them.", "A large, invasive anuran species native to the Americas, known for its tendency to consume native parasites without becoming infected, potentially alleviating the burden of parasitic diseases on native anurans, while also exhibiting a natural resistance to the lungworms that infect native frogs."], "Rhinella marina": ["A large, introduced species of frog native to the Americas, notorious for devastating native ecosystems in Australia and known for its ability to host certain parasites that may actually benefit native frog populations.", "A large, non-native amphibian introduced to Australia, known for potentially reducing parasite burdens in native frogs by hosting and not transmitting lungworm larvae.", "A large, invasive frog species native to Central and South America, known for its ability to harbor lungworm larvae that fail to develop and instead benefit native Australian frog populations by reducing their parasite burdens."], "Australian frogs": ["Amphibians native to the continent often referred to as Oceania, characterized by a unique set of fauna that have adapted to its diverse and ancient environment.", "Amphibians native to the landmass known for its unique fauna, distinct indigenous cultures, and vast deserts.", "Amphibians native to the continent of Australia, which are hosts to specific lungworms that have been observed to have a reduced presence after the arrival of invasive cane toads."], "toads": ["Amphibians that are introduced species in Australia, capable of hosting lungworm larvae without sustaining infection, and potentially reducing the parasite burden of native Australian frogs.", "A type of amphibian that is capable of absorbing and not succumbing to lungworm larvae, thereby potentially reducing parasite burdens of native frogs.", "A type of warty, amphibian creature that, when introduced to a new environment, can potentially assume parasites that would otherwise harm native species, and may even prime the immune system of those native species to resist their own parasites."], "anurans": ["A group of amphibians characterized by a larval stage that undergoes metamorphosis, with a prominent hind leg adaptation for jumping, and possessing a respiratory system that is adapted for both aquatic and terrestrial environments.", "Small, often colorful, tail-bearing amphibians that breed on land and have a semi-aquatic larval stage.", "A group of amphibians characterized by their jumping ability, typically found in or near bodies of water, and often subject to competition for resources and habitat with non-native species, which may influence their immune systems and susceptibility to parasites."], "lungworm larvae": ["Small, immature, worm-like organisms that infect the lungs of certain animals, which are typically transmitted through exposure to contaminated soil or water and can cause respiratory problems if left untreated.", "The early developmental stage of a parasitic worm that attaches to and feeds on the respiratory system of certain amphibians, ultimately resulting in significant health issues for the host.", "The immature stages of a parasitic helminth that infect the respiratory systems of certain anuran amphibians, characterized by their ability to emerge from
