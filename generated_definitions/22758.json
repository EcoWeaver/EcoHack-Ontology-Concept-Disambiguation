animal life.", "Permanent or temporary bodies of still or slow-moving freshwater that are located away from coastal areas, often characterized by a distinct ecosystem and supporting a variety of aquatic life forms, and which play a crucial role in the water cycle, water quality, and ecological balance of surrounding regions.", "A type of aquatic ecosystem characterized by its freshwater nature and absence of direct sea water influence, often featuring lakes, rivers, and streams, which play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services."], "non-indigenous species": ["A species that originates from a region other than its native habitat, and has been introduced, intentionally or unintentionally, to a new area, potentially causing harm to the local ecosystem and native species.", "A species that originated outside the native range of a specific region or ecosystem, and has been introduced or accidentally transported to that area, often with potentially significant ecological, economic, or sanitary impacts.", "A type of species that originates from a different geographic area and has been introduced, either intentionally or unintentionally, to an ecosystem where it does not naturally occur, and has the potential to cause harm to native species, habitats, or human health."], "carrier": ["A living organism that unintentionally facilitates the transfer of a pathogenic microorganism to other species, serving as a vehicle for transmission of disease without necessarily displaying symptoms itself.", "An organism that unintentionally transports and transmits a pathogen, often without showing symptoms itself, but poses a risk to other organisms that come into contact with it.", "An organism that unwittingly conveys a pathogenic agent from one location to another, often through direct contact, which can subsequently affect the health and survival of other organisms in its new environment."], "ectoparasite": ["A type of microscopic, non-biological organism that lives on the outer surface of another living creature, potentially causing harm or disease, and is typically spread through contact with an infected host.", "Microorganisms that live on the surface of an animal, often feeding on it or causing harm, can cause disease and harm to the aquatic organisms they infest.", "A type of microorganism that feeds on the skin or outer body surface of aquatic animals, often transmitted by non-native species and capable of causing harm to the infected host, posing a threat to native populations and ecosystems."], "aquatic organisms": ["Animals and plants that inhabit water environments, including lakes, rivers, and wetlands, which can be threatened by pathogenic microorganisms and ectoparasites carried by non-native species.", "The inhabitants of freshwater environments, including both vertebrates and invertebrates, that rely on the water for survival and whose life cycles are often closely tied to the aquatic ecosystem.", "Species of animals and plants that live in or near water, which can be affected by external parasites or pathogens that can impact their health and survival."], "red swamp crayfish": ["A large, invasive, aquatic crustacean native to North America, characterized by its ability to introduce and spread pathogens, including Oomycetes, throughout European waterways, posing a significant threat to native aquatic species.", "A semi-aquatic, invasive crustacean native to the southeastern United States, known to colonize freshwater habitats in Europe and often serve as a vector for disease-carrying pathogens, such as a specific type of oomycete.", "A semi-aquatic crustacean species originating from the southeastern United States, known for its ability to colonize and cause harm to European crayfish populations, while also potentially carrying disease-causing microorganisms, which can have implications for both ecological and sanitary concerns."], "Procambarus clarkii": ["A type of non-indigenous, invasive crustacean widely recognized as a significant threat to native aquatic species in Europe, often serving as a vector for various pathogens.", "A non-native, small, freshwater crustacean widely considered a significant threat to European native crayfish species, capable of carrying various microorganisms that can harm aquatic organisms, and commonly found in Lake Trasimeno.", "A non-indigenous, invasive species of freshwater crustacean, notorious for carrying pathogens that pose a significant threat to native European crayfish species, and has been found to harbor a previously unknown fungus in Italian inland waters."], "pathogen": ["A tiny, unwanted guest that can inhabit the skin or shell of an aquatic organism and cause harm or disease.", "A microscopic, usually tiny, organism that can cause harm to the health or well-being of other living organisms, often by attaching itself to or infecting them.", "A microscopic, disease-causing organism that is often carried by non-native aquatic species and can harm or kill native aquatic organisms, potentially threatening the ecological balance and sanitary condition of inland waters."], "epibiontic microfungi": ["Microorganisms that attach to and colonize the bodies of other organisms, often serving as potential pathogens and posing a threat to the health and ecological balance of the host species, and potentially having implications for both environmental and sanitary concerns.", "Microorganisms that live on the exterior surfaces of animals, often harming their hosts or other organisms in the ecosystem.", "A type of fungal parasite that lives on the outer surface of another organism, often an aquatic animal, and can cause disease or harm to its host."], "invasive crayfish": ["A non-native, non-indigenous aquatic crustacean species that has established a self-sustaining population in a given body of water, often posing a significant threat to the local ecosystem and potentially carrying disease-causing pathogens that can harm indigenous species.", "A non-native species of freshwater crustacean that has been introduced to a new region or ecosystem, often with potentially devastating effects on the native ecosystem and its inhabitants.", "A non-native species of crustacean that, through its introduction to a new environment, can cause harm to native species, ecosystems, and human health, often facilitated by its ability to carry and transmit pathogens to aquatic organisms."]}
