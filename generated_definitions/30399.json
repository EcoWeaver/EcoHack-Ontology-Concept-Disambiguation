fungus grows, as measured by the volume of tissue in which the fungus has successfully established and reproduced."], "fruiting body production": ["The process by which a fungus produces and releases reproductive structures that disperse spores, which are capable of germinating into new fungal individuals, and is characterized by the number, size, and surface area of these structures.", "The process by which a fungus generates and matures structures capable of producing and dispersing spores, resulting in the reproduction and spread of the fungus.", "The process by which a fungus releases reproductive structures, capable of producing and dispersing spores, from its colonized substrate, which determines its ability to spread and propagate its species."], "number and size of fruiting
