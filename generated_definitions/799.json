plant species becoming established, spreading, and dominating native ecosystems, often with significant ecological, economic, and social consequences, posing a threat to biodiversity, ecosystem health, and human activities."], "global change": ["A comprehensive and interconnected series of alterations to the Earth's environment, encompassing modifications to atmospheric conditions, temperature patterns, and precipitation cycles, which collectively influence the dynamics of ecosystems and the spread of plant species.", "The multifaceted phenomenon characterized by alterations to the planet's fundamental environmental conditions, encompassing shifts in temperature, precipitation patterns, and atmospheric composition, which can influence the distribution, abundance, and

precipitation patterns, atmospheric composition, and other factors that have the potential to influence the distribution, abundance, and behavior of organisms."], "CO2": ["The amount of a greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere that increases as a result of human activities and climate patterns, often leading to amplified warming effects on the environment.", "A gaseous environmental component that, in many cases, stimulates the growth and expansion of non-native plant species, thereby facilitating their invasion and colonization of new ecosystems.", "The invisible, odorless gas emitted by human activities, natural processes, and fossil fuel combustion, which has a significant impact on the Earth's climate and ecosystem dynamics, influencing the success and spread of plant species in various environments."], "temperature": ["A measure of the warmth or coolness of the air, playing a crucial role in determining the growth and spread of non-native plant species, where increases or decreases in this measure can either facilitate or hinder the establishment and expansion of invasive flora.", "The amount of warmth or coolness in the air that can affect the growth and behavior of living organisms, such as plants, which can influence their ability to establish and spread in new areas.", "The amount of heat or warmth emanating from the Earth's surface, influencing the growth and spread of organisms, including plants, by affecting their metabolism, reproduction, and migratory patterns."], "precipitation": ["The amount of water that falls from the atmosphere to the earth's surface, varying in magnitude and timing, influencing the conditions in which plants grow.", "The quantity of water falling to the ground as rainfall, snow, sleet, or hail, which can influence the likelihood and extent of plant invasions in response to global changes.", "The amount of water that falls to the Earth's surface over a given area, which can play a crucial role in influencing the spread and establishment of non-native plant species."], "invasive plants": ["Species of vegetation that thrive outside their natural geographic range, often displacing native plants and disrupting ecosystems, and whose presence is commonly linked to environmental disturbances or human activities.", "A species of flora that, when introduced to a new geographic area, reproduces and spreads rapidly, often outcompeting native vegetation and altering the local ecosystem, thereby potentially causing harm to the environment, economy, and human health.", "Non-native plant species that displace native vegetation and can outcompete native species for resources, often altering ecosystem composition and potentially causing ecological, economic, and social harm."], "risk assessments": ["The process of quantifying and evaluating the likelihood of adverse or beneficial outcomes resulting from potential environmental scenarios, using data and expert opinions to inform decisions on resource allocation and management strategies.", "An analysis of potential scenarios of uncertain outcomes, intended to identify and quantify the likelihood of unwanted consequences or unexplored opportunities that arise from interactions between environmental factors and biological systems, thus informing management decisions and preparedness for various outcomes.", "An evaluation of the likelihood and potential consequences of negative impacts on the environment or ecosystem resulting from the presence or spread of a non-native plant species."], "predictive tools": ["Devices or methods designed to estimate the likelihood or occurrence of future ecological events, such as the spread of invasive species, by analyzing and combining various environmental and climatic factors.", "Methods or techniques used to estimate and anticipate the likelihood or potential outcomes of a particular event or process, taking into account various factors that may influence its occurrence, thus informing decision-making and planning.", "Methods or models that aim to forecast the likelihood, timing, or extent of potential events or outcomes, such as the spread of invasive plant species, by analyzing and interpreting various factors that influence their occurrence."], "restoration": ["The process of reversing or mitigating the harmful effects of an invasive species' dominance on a previously unaffected ecosystem, thereby allowing the ecosystem to recover its natural balance and diversity.", "The process of re-establishing a native ecosystem's natural balance and ecological integrity by eliminating or controlling invasive species that are detrimental to the environment, allowing native species to thrive and recover, thereby revitalizing a previously degraded or damaged ecosystem.", "The deliberate and managed return of an ecosystem or environment to its natural or optimal state, often involving the reintroduction of native species or elimination of non-native ones, to mitigate the effects of human activities or other disruptions."]}
