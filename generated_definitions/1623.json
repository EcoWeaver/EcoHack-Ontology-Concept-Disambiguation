responses to rapid environmental changes.", "When species adjust their ranges in response to environmental changes, they may inadvertently be drawn to resources that, although initially beneficial, ultimately compromise their fitness and reproductive success due to maladaptive developmental pathways or increased exposure to detrimental conditions.", "Phenotypic preferences that lead animals to unwittingly select environments or resources that negatively impact their reproductive success and overall fitness, potentially causing long-term population decline or even extinction."], "range shifts": ["The phenomenon by which populations of organisms adapt to changing environmental conditions by relocating to areas that provide more favorable living conditions, resulting in a change to their geographic distribution.", "The phenomenon where populations of a species, in response to changing environmental conditions, alter the spatial distribution of their individuals to occupy new areas that provide a more favorable ecological niche.", "The process by which populations of an organism adaptively change the distribution of their geographic presence in response to alterations in

changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and other ecological factors, leading to an unprecedented and accelerating pace of environmental transformation.", "The accelerated and widespread alteration of environmental conditions by human activities, leading to unprecedented and rapid changes in the distribution and availability of natural resources, thereby posing significant threats to

specific environmental conditions, and exhibit distinct behaviors, thus defining their place within the ecological landscape.", "A group of living organisms that have developed distinct characteristics, behaviors, or adaptations that enable them to survive and reproduce in a specific environment, and that are often identified by their unique physiological, anatomical, or genetic features.", "A distinct set of characteristics, encompassing physical traits, behavioral adaptations, and reproductive patterns, that are passed from one generation to the next and enable a group of living organisms to thrive in their environment, yet remain vulnerable to the consequences of environmental changes that alter the availability of resources and habitats."], "environment": ["A dynamic system comprising physical and biological components, subject to transformations caused by living organisms and external factors, which in turn affects the ability of species to adapt and survive.", "The sum total of circumstances that affect the physical conditions and biological pressures that living organisms face in a specific geographic area.", "The composite of factors, such as temperature, humidity, and availability of resources, that shape the conditions in which organisms live and respond to stimuli in their surroundings, thereby influencing their chances of survival, growth, and reproduction."], "fitness": ["The ability of a species to effectively adapt and thrive in its environment, measured by its capacity to survive, reproduce, and pass on beneficial traits to its offspring.", "The successful reproduction and survival of an individual within its environment, quantified by its ability to adapt, thrive, and propagate its genetic information to future generations,

its environment."], "maladaptive developmental pathways": ["A mistaken or inefficient sequence of physiological and morphological changes that occur during an individual's development, leading to reduced fitness and potentially compromising population persistence.", "A pattern of growth or development that arises in response to environmental cues, but ultimately leads to reduced fitness or increased susceptibility to environmental pressures, thereby diminishing the likelihood of survival and reproduction.", "The incorrect or misguided physiological or behavioral changes that occur during an organism's growth and development, potentially resulting in reduced fitness or survival, as a consequence of environmental alterations."], "population persistence": ["The long-term continuity and viability of a group of organisms, characterized by its ability to adapt and reproduce successfully, ultimately maintaining its size and genetic diversity over multiple generations.",
