species": ["The original, native inhabitants of an ecosystem, which interact with and are affected by the introduction of a non-native species.", "A population of organisms that has inhabited a

"A naturally occurring species that occupies a particular environment or ecological niche, with which an introduced species interacts, influencing the likelihood of the introduced species' establishment."], "predator-prey": ["A type of biotic interaction in which one species actively captures and consumes another species for energy, nutrients, or protection, influencing the population dynamics and evolution of both species involved.", "A relationship in which one organism consumes another as a source of nutrients, where the consumed organism typically attempts to evade or defend against the consumer, thereby driving a continuous evolutionary response.", "The interplay between a species that captures and consumes another species, influencing the latter's population dynamics and potentially triggering adaptations to evade predation."], "mutualistic": ["A relationship between two species in which one species benefits directly and the other species is neither harmed nor benefited, allowing both species to thrive together in a particular environment.", "A relationship between two species where one species benefits from the presence or actions of the other, and the other species benefits equally or simultaneously.", "A reciprocal relationship between two species in which one species derives a benefit and the other species is not harmed, which can influence the probability of a non-native species becoming established in a new environment."], "competitive interactions": ["A dynamic process between two species in which one species' ability to obtain a shared resource, such as food or habitat, is hindered by the presence and activity of the other species, leading to a direct impact on each species' survival and reproduction.", "The struggle between two species for a limited resource, where one species' growth and survival are hindered by the presence of the other, and neither species can coexist without influencing the other's success.", "A dynamic relationship between two species where they strive for the same limited resource, resulting in an ongoing struggle for dominance, survival, and reproduction."], "eco-evolutionary models": ["Models that integrate the dynamics of biological interactions and evolutionary processes to predict the outcome of interactions between introduced and resident species during the establishment phase of an invasion, considering the role of genetic variation and coevolution in shaping the trajectory of species interactions.", "A set of theoretical frameworks that simulate the dynamic interplay between the environmental pressures exerted by a resident species and the genetic responses of an introduced species, thereby elucidating the probabilistic outcome of their coexistence, specifically in

traits of multiple interacting species, capturing the iterative process of adaptation, selection, and evolution that shapes the outcome of their encounters."], "genetic variation": ["The inherent differences within a population's characteristics that result from the diverse array of inheritable traits and traits-in-the-making that define the population's make-up, playing a crucial role in shaping the population's response to its environment, interactions, and evolution over time.", "The range of possible physical and behavioral characteristics that can be exhibited by individuals

novel species into a recipient environment, characterized by the species' adaptation to its biotic interactions and ability to persist in the presence of native organisms.", "The process by which a non-native species becomes a self-sustaining part of its new ecosystem, achieving a level of presence and influence that is persistent and potentially long-lasting.", "The process by which a non-native population becomes self-sustaining and integrated into the native ecosystem, often resulting in the persistence of the introduced species over time."], "coevolution": ["The process by which the evolutionary changes in one species influence the evolutionary changes in another species with which it interacts, thereby modifying the conditions for establishment and coexistence.", "The reciprocal evolutionary adaptation of two or more species that interact with each other, resulting in a dynamic equilibrium where each species influences the evolution of the other, potentially leading to altered interactions, population dynamics, and community structure.", "The process by which the genetic makeup of an introduced species and a resident species that interact with each other evolves simultaneously, potentially leading to changes in the frequency of genotypes, phenotypes, or even the species' survival and establishment in a new environment."], "invasibility": ["The propensity of a community to undergo a transformation in its composition and interactions, driven by the introduction of a non-native species, such that the community's dynamics and resistance to
