{"non-indigenous species": ["A living organism that has colonized a geographical area outside of its natural or ancestral range, typically as a result of human activity, and can outcompete native species for resources and habitat.", "Organisms that have been introduced to an ecosystem through human activity and are not native to that environment, often leading to potential impacts on the local ecosystem.", "Species that originate from a different geographic region than where they are currently established and are not naturally found in that environment."], "pathway": ["A specific route or mechanism through which non-indigenous species are introduced into an ecosystem, often influenced by human activity or decision-making, and serving as a key factor in determining the probability of species establishment.", "The mechanism by which non-indigenous species enter a region, facilitated through human activity, and which can be tracked and monitored to understand the likelihood of successful establishment.", "The specific means or channels through which non-indigenous species are transported and introduced into a new environment, often influenced by human activities."], "propagule pressure": ["The extent to which non-native organisms, brought into an ecosystem through human activity, have the opportunity to successfully colonize and establish a sustainable population, with higher levels indicating a greater likelihood of successful establishment.", "The aggregate quantity of a specific biological entity's successful introductions into a new environment, representing the intensity and cumulative effect of its presence on the establishment of a self-sustaining population.", "The cumulative quantity of viable biological material transported into a new environment through various conduits, which serves as a driving force behind the successful establishment of non-indigenous species."], "establishment curve": ["A graphical representation of the probability of successful colonization and spread of non-native species in a given area, based on the amount of propagules or introductions that have occurred through specific pathways, allowing for predictions about the likelihood of future establishments.", "A graphical representation of the relationship between the likelihood of a non-native species becoming established in a new environment and the amount of species introductions, providing a tool for predicting which species are most likely to establish and become invasive.", "A mathematical representation that illustrates the likelihood of a non-indigenous species becoming established in a new environment, based on the amount of organisms introduced into that environment, and allows for predictions about which species are at risk of establishment."], "habitat": ["The specific set of environmental conditions and biotic interactions that a species requires to survive, reproduce, and thrive, and can be quantified through proxies such as import data or other forms of propagule pressure, which can inform the prediction of establishment probability and subsequent risk analyses.", "The specific environment, conditions, and circumstances that influence the survival and propagation of a particular biological entity, encompassing factors such as physical settings, living organisms, and historical patterns of introduction and establishment.", "The physical environment in which a specific group of organisms naturally reside, interact, and thrive, influenced by various biotic and abiotic factors that contribute to their establishment, survival, and reproduction."], "aquarium fish": ["Exotic, domesticated water dwellers, typically maintained for human entertainment, often originating from diverse natural habitats and intentionally or unintentionally introduced into non-native environments through various means of transportation.", "Exotic, ornamental, aquatic creatures commonly kept for aesthetic purposes and often introduced to the environment through commercial importation or personal trade.", "Aquatic organisms intentionally introduced and traded for decorative or recreational purposes, often through international import and sale."], "import data": ["Data on the quantity and distribution of organisms intentionally moved from their native habitats to a new region, which can be used as a proxy for the likelihood of establishment of non-indigenous species.", "Records of goods and products moving across international borders, specifically the quantities of particular items that enter a country over a given period, used as a surrogate measure for the likelihood of invasive species establishing themselves in a new environment.", "Information gathered on the frequency and volume of movement of organisms from their original habitats to a new location, often tracked through records of their introduction into a country or region through various means, such as trade or human activity."], "United States": ["A geographic entity comprising diverse ecosystems and habitats, characterized by a vast and populous territory with a federal system of government, situated in the Americas and boasting a rich biodiversity, cultural heritage, and economic significance.", "A large, contiguous country in North America with a shared border, consisting of diverse geography, climate zones, and a federal system of government, serving as a major hub for international trade, cultural exchange, and environmental research.", "A vast, continental entity comprising a federal constitutional republic with a diverse array of geographical regions, cultural influences, and economic systems, characterized by a common set of laws, governance structures, and a shared national identity."], "North America": ["A geographic region comprising a vast territory that spans the northernmost part of the Americas, characterized by diverse ecosystems, species, and human activities, serving as a hub for international trade and migration of non-indigenous species.", "A continental landmass comprising vast territories of the Western Hemisphere, bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, encompassing a diverse range of ecosystems and inhabited by a multitude of native and non-native species.", "The continental landmass comprising the United States, Canada, and Mexico, as well as surrounding islands and coastal regions, which together form a broad geographic area in the Northern Hemisphere."]}
