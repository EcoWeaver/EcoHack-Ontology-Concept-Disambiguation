factors that could impact the distribution and abundance of a species."], "invasion prone areas": ["Regions that exhibit an increased susceptibility to colonization and spread of a non-native species, characterized by environmental conditions that favor the species' survival, growth, and reproduction, and are likely to be impacted by climate change, leading to an elevated risk of invasion.",

topography, that favor the survival and reproduction of the species.", "Regions with specific ecological conditions that are conducive to the spread and establishment of an invasive alien species, which are likely to face an increased risk of being colonized and potentially outcompeted by the invasive species."], "geographical distribution": ["The specific regions or areas where a particular species or invasive alien species is likely to be found, spread, or establish itself, influenced by environmental factors and climatic conditions.", "The spatial arrangement of areas where a species is likely to occur, as determined by its environmental preferences and tolerances, which can be influenced by factors such as temperature, precipitation, and other climatic conditions.", "The extent
