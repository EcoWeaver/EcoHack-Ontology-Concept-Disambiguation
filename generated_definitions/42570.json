ecosystem, aiming to understand its population dynamics and interactions with other species, in order to inform management decisions and identify potential ecological implications.", "The systematic

time."], "native species": ["Organisms that have evolved and developed in a particular region or ecosystem without being intentionally or unintentionally introduced by human activity, and which play a natural role in the functioning of that ecosystem.", "Species that have evolved and thrived in an ecosystem over time, often before the arrival of invasive species, and play a natural role in the ecosystem's structure and function, which may be affected by the presence of invasive species.", "Organisms that have evolved and adapted to a specific ecosystem over a long period of time, and whose populations have developed naturally without intentional human introduction or propagation."], "net-spinning caddisflies": ["Aquatic insects with a peculiar habit of constructing protective cases by spinning silken nets around themselves, thereby obtaining camouflage and protection from predators, which are now exhibiting a dramatic increase in biomass in response to the decline of an invasive species.", "Aquatic insects that use plant-based materials to construct protective cases, resembling tiny houses or bags, and spend a significant part of their life cycle suspended in the water column by these constructions.", "A type of aquatic insect larva that constructs protective shelters, commonly referred to as \"nests\", by spinning sticky silk threads from silk glands in its body, often
