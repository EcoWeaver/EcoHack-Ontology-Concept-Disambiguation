{"alien species": ["Species that originated from outside a specific geographic area or ecosystem, and have been introduced to that area or ecosystem through natural or human-mediated means, leading to potential impacts on the native biota and ecosystem processes.", "Non-native organisms introduced to an ecosystem through unintentional or intentional human activity, which can cause significant ecological, economic, and societal impacts.", "Non-native organisms introduced into a previously uninvaded ecosystem or environment through human activity or other natural means, causing potential harm to the native flora and fauna."], "biological invasions": ["The phenomenon wherein non-native living organisms, driven by chance and unpredictable factors, arrive and establish themselves in a new geographic location, potentially causing harm to the native ecosystem, environment, and economy.", "The unexpected and unpredictable introduction of non-native organisms into a previously unaffected ecosystem, often resulting in significant ecological and economic disruptions.", "The uncontrolled and unintended introduction of non-native organisms, which can outcompete native species for resources and habitat, causing detrimental impacts on ecosystems and potentially resulting in significant economic and environmental damage."], "uncertainty": ["The state of ambiguity or vagueness in the occurrence, timing, or outcome of events that affects decision-making processes, particularly in contexts where the arrival of extraneous entities or phenomena is inherently unpredictable.", "The unpredictable and inherently variable nature of events, outcomes, or phenomena that can affect the management and understanding of a particular situation or system.", "The inherent unpredictability of events or outcomes, resulting from the lack of complete knowledge or information about factors influencing their occurrence or magnitude, which can significantly impact decision-making and planning in fields such as management and conservation."], "stochastic arrival": ["The unpredictable and randomly timed arrival of foreign species into a new environment, where the occurrence and timing of such events are influenced by chance and probability rather than predictable patterns or certain outcomes.", "The unpredictable and random pattern of appearance and introduction of foreign organisms into a new environment, characterized by a lack of control and certainty in their timing, occurrence, and extent.", "The unpredictable and random occurrence of extraneous living organisms into a new environment, characterized by the uncertainty of when and if such events will occur, and the potential consequences they may have on the affected ecosystem."], "parameter": ["A value that determines the underlying pattern or behavior of a random event or process, influencing the likelihood and consequences of its occurrence.", "The specific value or setting that determines the behavior or characteristics of a mathematical model or process, used to govern the occurrence of certain events or outcomes in a particular context.", "A numerical value that governs the probability of occurrence of a random event, influencing the behavior of a process or system."], "process": ["A description of a series of events or changes that occur over a specified period of time, involving factors that are not fully predictable and governed by a set of rules or patterns that are not always consistent.", "The underlying pattern or sequence of events that occurs due to the unpredictable arrival and interaction of foreign entities, resulting in a predictable outcome that is shaped by random fluctuations in the timing and frequency of these events.", "A sequence of events or phenomena that unfolds over time, governed by a set of rules or probabilities, which can be deterministic or probabilistic in nature, influencing the trajectory of a system or phenomenon."], "time period": ["A discrete span of duration marked by distinct intervals or boundaries, during which specific events or phenomena occur or are evaluated for a particular inquiry or study.", "A well-defined interval of duration, encompassing a finite sequence of discrete moments, within which a particular event or phenomenon of interest occurs, unfolds, or is quantified.", "The interval or duration over which a particular phenomenon or set of events is studied or considered, characterized by a defined starting and ending point, within which all data, occurrences, or effects are aggregated and analyzed."], "monetary damage": ["The measurable and quantifiable harm or loss incurred to the environment, economy, or human society as a direct or indirect result of the arrival and establishment of non-native species in a particular ecosystem or region, often expressed in financial terms.", "The sum of the economic costs and losses resulting from the introduction and establishment of non-native species in an ecosystem, including, but not limited to, impacts on agricultural productivity, infrastructure, and human health, as well as the value of affected natural resources.", "The quantifiable, tangible losses or costs incurred by the introduction of a non-native species, resulting from disruptions to ecosystems, harm to natural resources, and negative impacts on human societies and economies."]}
