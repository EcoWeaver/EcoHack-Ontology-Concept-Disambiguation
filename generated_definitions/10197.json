vitality, including the loss of unique species and their interactions, leading to a decline in the complexity and richness of ecological relationships and processes."], "woody plant invasion": ["The proliferation and dominance of non-native plant species with woody stems in an ecosystem, often accompanied by the displacement and loss of native species, and potentially leading to alterations in the ecosystem's structure and function.", "The unintended and often rapid spread of non-native vegetation that gradually replaces native plant species, compromising the ecological balance and biodiversity of a forest ecosystem, typically occurring on islands where isolation and limited natural predators create an environment conducive to the establishment and dominance of invasive plant species.", "The uncontrolled and rapid expansion of non-native, woody vegetation into native ecosystems, often leading to the displacement of native species and alterations to ecosystem processes, resulting in a shift towards a new, non-native plant community that can threaten the ecological integrity and biodiversity of the affected area."], "invasive species": ["A non-native plant species that establishes and spreads rapidly in a previously unaffected ecosystem, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering the natural balance, posing a significant threat to the native flora and fauna.", "Species that have escaped human intervention and spread rapidly to occupy habitats where they are not native, often outcompeting and displacing indigenous species.", "A plant species that has been introduced to an ecosystem and outcompetes native flora by occupying and transforming previously uncolonized habitats, leading to alterations in community composition and potential loss of biodiversity."], "native species": ["Species that have evolved and adapted to a specific environment, often over thousands or millions of years, and are naturally found in that ecosystem without human introduction or disturbance, playing a vital role in the local food chain, ecological balance, and biodiversity.", "Plants that have co-evolved with the unique environmental and ecological conditions of an island ecosystem over a prolonged period of time, resulting in a natural, symbiotic relationship between the plant and its environment, and are typically characteristic

ecological niche and playing a crucial role in maintaining the ecosystem's natural balance and diversity."], "forest canopy gaps": ["Areas of openness within a dense vegetative layer, where the density and vertical structure of vegetation are reduced, allowing for greater exposure to light and potentially facilitating the establishment and outcompetition of non-native plant species.", "Areas within a forest where the dense overhead growth has been disturbed or removed, creating openings that allow invasive plant species to establish themselves by exploiting the sunlight and space, potentially outcompeting native species.", "Areas in a forest where the dense overhead layer of foliage is disrupted, creating openings that allow sunlight to reach the forest floor and provide opportunities for exotic plant species to establish themselves, potentially outcompeting native species for resources and space."], "plant cover": ["A density of foliage that provides shelter, food,
