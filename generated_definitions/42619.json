valuable resource for botanists, recorders, and enthusiasts.", "A comprehensive guide that categorizes and describes various plant species, typically including illustrations or photographs to aid in identification, and is organized in a standardized format for easy reference and research."], "native status": ["The classification of a plant species as being indigenous to a particular region, based on the date of its initial discovery or documentation in that area, and supported by a lack of significant spread or establishment prior to that point in time, often contrasted with species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced from elsewhere.", "The quality of being indigenous and naturally occurring in a specific geographic region, with no recorded history of human introduction or intentional cultivation outside of its native habitat, and where subsequent widespread documentation of its presence is a recent phenomenon.", "The original or indigenous existence

areas may be a result of human introduction or migration, and may be subject to varying degrees of cultural, biological, or ecological adaptation.", "Plants that have been present in a specific region
