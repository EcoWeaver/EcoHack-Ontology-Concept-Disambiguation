{"alien invasive species": ["Organisms introduced from other regions, often unintentionally or intentionally, that have no natural predators or competitors in their new environment and can displace native species, disrupt ecosystems, and cause significant ecological harm.", "Non-native species that colonize an ecosystem and outcompete or displace native species, threatening the delicate balance of the ecosystem and potentially causing significant environmental, economic, and social impacts.", "Organisms introduced to a non-native ecosystem, often as a result of human activity, that can outcompete and displace native species, causing significant harm to the environment, economy, and human health."], "biodiversity": ["The variety and abundance of different types of living organisms that coexist in a particular area, and the ecosystem's resilience to changes caused by the introduction of non-native species.", "The variety and abundance of different types of living organisms, including plants, animals, and microorganisms, that coexist in an ecosystem and contribute to its ecological, economic, and aesthetic value.", "The variety and richness of different species and ecosystems found in a particular region, which can be threatened by the introduction of non-native species that can outcompete and displace native ones, leading to a loss of natural balance and ecological integrity."], "wetland ecosystems": ["Areas of land that are periodically or permanently saturated with water, characterized by unique plant and animal communities adapted to these conditions, and often serving as important habitats for species and ecological processes.", "Ecosystems characterized by saturated soils or frequent flooding, supporting a unique assemblage of plant and animal species adapted to these conditions, and providing critical habitat for various biodiversity components.", "Areas of land that are saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally, and are characterized by unique assemblages of plants and animals adapted to these conditions, and often play a crucial role in maintaining water quality and filtering out pollutants."], "terrestrial ecosystems": ["Ecosystems existing on land, encompassing varied environments that support a wide range of plants and animals, including forests, grasslands, and agricultural areas, which can be affected by invasive species and are important habitats for native biodiversity.", "The areas of land that are home to a variety of living organisms, including plants, animals, and microorganisms, which interact with each other and their environment in a complex web of relationships, shaping the composition and function of the environment over time.", "Ecosystems that consist of plants, animals, and microorganisms that live in the areas where solid ground is above water, and which support complex interactions between the different components of the environment, such as soil, air, and water."], "climatic zones": ["Regions of varying environmental conditions that can be distinguished by factors such as temperature, humidity, and vegetation type, which influence the distribution and abundance of plant and animal species in a particular geographic area.", "Regions characterized by distinct patterns of temperature and precipitation variability, influencing the distribution and abundance of organisms and ecosystems, which are used to define the areas surveyed for the presence of alien invasive species in Sri Lanka.", "Regions on the Earth's surface characterized by distinct temperature and precipitation patterns, influencing the distribution and abundance of plants and animals, which can affect the impact of alien invasive species on native ecosystems."], "fauna": ["Organisms that inhabit or visit terrestrial and aquatic environments, excluding plant life, but including animals that live on or in land, water, or air.", "The collective term for the animals that inhabit a particular region, referring specifically to those species that are native to or have been introduced to that area.", "Organisms that inhabit the land, air, or water environments of a region, including creatures with backbones, such as animals, reptiles, birds, and fish, as well as invertebrates like insects, worms, and mollusks."], "flora": ["The aggregate of plant species native to a specific geographical region, including trees, flowers, grasses, and other vegetative organisms that have evolved over time to thrive in that area.", "The collective term for plants native to a particular region, including both wild and cultivated species, that contribute to the local ecosystem and biodiversity.", "Plants that are native to a particular geographic region, including trees, shrubs, vines, and grasses, that provide habitat and food for other living organisms."], "native species": ["Species that have evolved and been present in a specific geographic area for an extended period of time, and have not been introduced to the area by human activity or natural phenomena, thereby having adapted to the local ecosystem and played a role in shaping its biodiversity.", "Species that have evolved and reside naturally within a geographic region, uninfluenced by human activity or intentional introduction from other areas, and are an integral part of the region's ecosystem.", "Species that are indigenous to a region or ecosystem, having co-evolved with the local environment and other species over a long period, and are not intentionally or unintentionally introduced by human activity."]}
