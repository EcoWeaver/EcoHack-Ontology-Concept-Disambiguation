its vulnerable ecosystem, which has been affected by invasive species."], "French coasts": ["The northern boundaries of the Western European continental shelf, where the territorial waters of a country meet the open ocean, and feature a diverse range of coastal ecosystems, including harbours and estuaries, which serve as hubs for international maritime trade.", "The littoral region along the northern border of Western Europe, adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean, where a significant portion of the region's seaports and harbours are located, and has been a hub for commercial shipping and human activity since ancient times.", "The Atlantic Ocean shoreline of Northwestern Europe where the English Channel and the North Sea meet, a region historically prone to introduction of non-native species through maritime trade and human activity."], "Eastern English Channel": ["The strait that connects the southern part of the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, located along the coasts of France and England, which has been home to a significant introduction of an invasive marine species.", "A region of the North Sea's eastern flank, bordering the northern coast of France, where the maritime connection to the wider North Sea facilitates the transfer of marine species.", "The narrow body of water separating the northern coast of France from the southern coast of England, known for its busy shipping lanes and historical presence of non-native species introductions."], "Bay of Seine": ["A semi-enclosed arm of the northern European sea that is bounded by the coast of Normandy and the Pas-de-Calais region, and serves as a critical habitat for non-native marine species to establish self-sustaining populations, which can then be dispersed to other waters through commercial shipping.", "A large and busy estuary located on the northern coast of France, at the mouth of a prominent river, where a significant port is situated and serves as a vital trade hub, making it an important introduction point for non-native species in the North Sea.", "A large body of water along the northern coast of France, which serves as a hub for commercial shipping and has been linked to the establishment of an invasive species in the regional marine ecosystem."], "Northern European waters": ["The region comprising the marine areas along the western shores of Europe, including the harbors and coasts of a group of countries located near the North Atlantic Ocean, which share a similar maritime ecosystem and are susceptible to the introduction of non-native species via

a history of aquatic introductions via shipping and human activity, including harbors and trade routes.", "Regions of the North Atlantic Ocean and adjacent coastal areas where marine species native to the Black Sea or Mediterranean Sea have been introduced through human activities, and where these introductions have occurred in multiple locations over the past few decades."], "self-sustaining population": ["A population that is able to persist and reproduce in a given environment, fueled by its own internal dynamics and not reliant on external introductions or supplementation, despite potential environmental fluctuations and disturbances.", "A demographic entity within an ecosystem that has achieved reproductive independence and continues to grow, reproduce, and adapt to its environment over time, relying solely on its own genetic material and local ecological conditions.", "A group of organisms that are able to maintain their own numbers and distribution within an area through natural reproduction and growth, without relying on outside sources of introduction or reinforcement, and can potentially disperse and colonize new locations."], "commercial shipping": ["A
