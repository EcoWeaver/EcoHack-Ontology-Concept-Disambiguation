liquid surface and a combination of pheromone and either no additional attraction or a supplementary light source.", "A type of trap designed to capture insects by utilizing a visual cue, often accompanied by a specific attractant, which is typically placed on or near a surface of a given height, allowing for the collection of moths and other airborne insects within a specific area."],

moth that threatens a major crop.", "A chemical substance released by a pest that attracts individuals of the same species, typically used to lure them into traps, thereby controlling their population.", "A specialized attractant used in mass trapping systems that mimics the chemical signals emitted by female moths to attract male moths, thereby increasing the catch rate of the pest species."], "light source": ["A supplementary attraction device added to some traps that enhances the lure's effectiveness by mimicking environmental cues typically found in the pest's natural habitat, thereby increasing the trap's capture efficiency.", "A means of attracting nocturnal pests to traps by mimicking the characteristics of the moon and nearby stars.", "A supplementary stimulus used in some traps to increase the attractiveness and capture efficiency of pheromone-baited traps for Tuta absoluta moths, potentially enhancing the overall effectiveness of mass trapping as a management strategy for this invasive pest."], "insecticide": ["A type of control substance that, when applied to a pest population, reduces the number of individual organisms through chemical means,
