{"Atlantic rock crab": ["A decapod crustacean species native to the Atlantic coast, known for its rapid spread to new areas, ability to reproduce successfully in new environments, and distinctive carapace growth pattern, often found in large numbers on soft-bottom coastal habitats.", "A decapod crustacean native to the Atlantic Ocean, characterized by its ability to rapidly colonize and reproduce in new areas, particularly soft-bottom coastal habitats, and exhibit moderate growth rates with frequent molting.", "A large, crustacean marine species originating from the eastern coast of North America, characterized by a distinctive carapace pattern, that has been introduced to Icelandic waters and is known for its rapid spread and successful reproduction on soft-bottom coastal habitats."], "population density": ["The number of individuals of a particular species occupying a given area, typically measured as a standardized value for a specific region or location.", "The average number of individuals of a species within a specified area, calculated by estimating the number of individuals and dividing it by the size of the area in which they were found.", "The number of individuals of a particular species that inhabit a defined area, calculated by dividing the total number of animals found within that area by the size of the area, typically expressed as a density per unit area, and used to estimate the concentration of a species in a specific environment."], "population growth": ["The increase in the number of individuals within a given area over time, quantifiable by the proportion of marked animals that are recaptured and found to have increased in size since their initial capture.", "The rate at which the number of organisms within a specific area increases over time, driven by a combination of factors such as reproduction, growth rates, and mortality rates, ultimately resulting in an augmentation of the individual count.", "The increase in the number of individuals of a species within a specific geographic area over a given period of time, as calculated through a mark-recapture study by comparing the initial number of marked individuals with the number of those individuals recaptured at a later time."], "mark-recapture study": ["A scientific investigation where individual members of a species are identified and marked with a unique tag or marker, and then subsequently caught again, enabling researchers to track the species' population size, growth, and movement patterns over time.", "A method of population analysis where individuals in a target species are uniquely identified and tracked over time by attaching a distinctive tag or mark, allowing researchers to estimate population size, growth rates, and movement patterns by monitoring the frequency of recaptured individuals.", "A research approach in which scientists mark or identify a sample of individuals from a population, release them back into their environment, and then recollect some of the same individuals to analyze their movement patterns, growth rates, and population size."], "non-indigenous species": ["A species that has been introduced to a new region or habitat, often unintentionally, through human activity, and has established a self-sustaining population, potentially altering the native ecosystem dynamics.", "A species whose introduction to an ecosystem occurs outside of its native range, and can potentially cause unintended ecological consequences.", "A species that has been introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, away from its natural geographic range, where it can establish a self-sustaining population, interact with native species, and potentially alter the ecosystem's balance and processes."], "soft-bottom coastal habitats": ["Areas along the coastline characterized by sedimentary surfaces, such as mud, sand, or silt, which provide a gentle and flexible environment for organisms to inhabit, where water flows and waves shape the terrain, allowing for a diverse range of flora and fauna to thrive.", "The type of coastal environment characterized by a substrate of unconsolidated sediment, such as mud, sand, or silt, that is regularly exposed to the influence of waves, tides, and ocean currents, and is often found in areas where human activities such as fishing or shipping are common, providing a habitat for a diverse range of marine organisms.", "Areas along the coast where sediment or loose debris forms a dense layer, providing a gentle and dynamic environment that allows for the settling of organisms, including those that are non-indigenous to the region."], "ecosystem": ["A complex network of living and non-living components that interact and interdependently maintain their dynamic balance, stability, and health, ultimately determining the overall well-being and resilience of the affected environment.", "The intricate network of interconnected biological and non-biological components that interact within a specific geographic area, influencing the distribution, abundance, and diversity of living organisms, and playing a crucial role in the flow of energy and nutrients.", "A complex web of interconnected living and non-living components that work together to maintain a delicate balance, where the relationships between these components, including the presence of certain non-native species, can significantly impact the overall structure and functioning of the system."]}
