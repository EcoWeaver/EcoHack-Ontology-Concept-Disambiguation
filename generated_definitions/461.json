another, facilitating the spread of illness.", "An organism, often a type of insect, that facilitates the transmission of a disease-causing agent from one host to another, playing a crucial role in the spread of a contagious disease.", "A microscopic organism that plays a crucial role in the transmission of diseases to humans, acting as a bridge between the disease-causing agent and the affected individual, often without showing symptoms itself."], "Dengue": ["A viral disease spread by a certain species of mosquito, causing a severe fever and joint pain, and often resulting in outbreaks that have significant public health implications.", "A severe and widespread tropical disease caused by a viral vector, which was responsible for recent outbreaks and is linked to another virus known for
