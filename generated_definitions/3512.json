where the transferred genetic material can become a significant part of the receiving species' genetic makeup."], "fungal species": ["A type of eukaryotic microorganism that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring with other members of its own group, but not with individuals from a different group that is reproductively isolated and shares a distinct genetic makeup.", "A distinct entity comprising a unique combination of genetic material, capable of reproduction, and characterized by its capacity to exchange genetic information through introgression with related entities, resulting in the dissemination of its characteristics and potential adaptation to new environments.", "A category of distinct biological entities characterized by shared ancestry, reproductive isolation, and recognizable physical and genetic differences, often exhibited by species-specific morphology, physiology, or genetic profiles that have evolved over time, enabling them to occupy distinct ecological niches and potentially engage in genetic exchange with other related entities."], "plant pathogen": ["An organism that attacks and infects plants, causing harm to their growth, development, or reproduction, and is typically dependent on the plant for its own survival.", "A microorganism that feeds on the cellular components of plants, causing disease or damage, often resulting in reduced plant vigor, yield, or death.", "An organism that exploits the tissues of non-related plants for its own survival and reproduction, often causing damage or death to the host plant."], "gene flow": ["The movement of genetic material, such as DNA sequences or entire alleles, from one species or population to another, resulting in the transfer of genetic information and altering the recipient's

changes in the recipient species' genetic composition and increasing the similarity between the two species.", "The process by which genetic material, typically in the form of DNA sequences or chromosomes, is transferred from one species or population to another, resulting in the integration of foreign genes or alleles into the recipient's genome, leading to changes in the recipient's genetic makeup."], "genome": ["The complete set of genetic information contained within an organism's biological makeup, composed of a vast array of discrete units that carry distinct characteristics

similarities between individuals or species, typically consisting of a distinct section of a chromosome or a sequence of nucleotides.", "A specific position or location along a chromosome or DNA sequence, where a particular gene or genetic marker is situated, often serving as a point of reference for studying genetic variation and introgression between different species."], "alleles": ["In the context of genetic inheritance, a particular form of a gene that can occur at a specific location on an organism's DNA, with different forms potentially determining different traits or characteristics. These gene variants can be either identical or slightly different, and they can be inherited from one generation to the next.", "A genetic variation within a specific region of an organism's DNA that can be inherited and can result in different physical traits or functions, such as protein structure or gene expression.", "Units of genetic information that can occupy the same location on a DNA molecule, potentially having different effects on the organism's traits or functions."], "introgression": ["The transfer of genetic material, often in the form of alleles, from one distinct species or lineage to another, resulting in the creation of new genetic combinations within the recipient species.", "The process of foreign genetic material, originating from one species, being incorporated into the gene pool of another species, resulting in the transfer of genetic information from one population to another, often leading to the creation of genetically admixed individuals with a mix of characteristics from both original species.", "The movement of genetic material from one species to another, resulting in the incorporation of alien DNA into an individual's genome, which can lead to the creation of novel genotypes and the reshuffling of genetic information across species boundaries."], "hybridization": ["The phenomenon where two distinct entities, once reproductively isolated, begin to share and exchange genetic material, resulting in the creation of novel genetic combinations and potentially altered phenotypes.", "The phenomenon where two distinct genetic lineages, previously isolated from one another, exchange genes and produce offspring with mixed ancestry, resulting in the transfer of genetic material and the creation of novel genetic combinations.", "The process by which genetic material from two distinct species is mixed and transmitted, resulting in the presence of novel alleles or genomes that have been shaped by the blending of ancestral information."]}
