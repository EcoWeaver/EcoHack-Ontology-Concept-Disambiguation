spread rapidly, causing harm to the native ecosystems and biodiversity.", "Species that, despite encountering increased damage from natural predators and competitors in their introduced range, are able to persist and spread due to factors other than a decrease in enemy pressure, potentially exhibiting characteristics such as rapid growth, reproductive output, and dispersal ability."], "noninvasive exotic species": ["Species that have been introduced to a new geographic area and have a population that is not causing significant harm or disruption to the native ecosystem.", "A plant species introduced to an area through human activity, but which does not outcompete native species for resources and habitat, nor cause significant harm to the environment or ecosystem, and therefore maintains a relatively balanced presence in its introduced range.", "A plant species that originates from another region, but does not exert significant ecological or economic impacts on its new environment, differing from certain other introduced species in the manner and degree to which it interacts with its new ecosystem."], "native species": ["A type of species that has evolved in a specific region over time, having co-evolved with native enemies and predators that shape its characteristics and survival strategies.", "A type of species that has co-evolved with other species in a specific geographic region and has not been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to that region by humans, thereby maintaining a natural balance of predator-prey relationships and ecological interactions.", "Species that evolved in a particular region or ecosystem and have co-existed with local predators and competitors for a long time, forming a specific balance in their population dynamics and ecological relationships."], "introduced range": ["The region or area where a non-native species has been deliberately or unintentionally brought and established, often resulting in interactions with local predators, competitors, and diseases that can affect its survival and spread.", "The geographical area where a non-native species is intentionally or unintentionally introduced and established, often resulting in interaction with native species and ecosystems.", "The area where a species, once absent or uncommon, has become established through human activity, and where it competes with native species for resources and habitat."], "enemy release hypothesis": ["The phenomenon where a species introduced to a new range initially experiences reduced attack or damage from natural predators and competitors, compared to native species and non-invasive exotic species, but may gradually lose this advantage over time as it spreads and acquires new predators and competitors.", "The idea that a species that is introduced to a new environment will experience reduced predation or competition from native species and will subsequently thrive or even become invasive due to the lack of evolved defenses or acquired enemies.", "The idea that a species' introduction to a new environment allows it to escape the pressures of its natural predators and competitors, which it faced in its native range, thereby granting it a selective advantage and increasing its likelihood of establishing a thriving population."], "insect herbivores": ["Organisms that feed on plants by consuming their leaves, stems, flowers, or seeds, using their mouthparts, saliva, and enzymes to break down and absorb nutrients.", "Organisms that feed on plants by consuming their leaves, stems, flowers, or other above-ground parts, often causing damage to the plant in the process.", "Organisms that consume plants as their primary source of nutrition and are capable of causing physical damage to plant tissues through their feeding activities."], "mammalian browsers": ["Herbivores that feed on plant material, especially vegetation, and often operate at a higher trophic level than insect herbivores, potentially contributing to the physical damage or consumption of plants.", "Organisms that consume plants by feeding on the above-ground, edible parts, such as leaves, stems, or fruits, rather than destroying or breaking down entire plants to obtain nutrients.", "Organisms that consume vegetation primarily through gnawing or cropping, often targeting leaves, stems, and branches, and are known to impact the growth and survival of introduced plant species."], "invasion": ["The process by which a non-native species, once introduced into a new environment, achieves widespread distribution and population growth, often causing harm to the native ecosystem.", "The phenomenon of a non-native species gradually expanding its range and prevalence within an ecosystem, often resulting in significant ecological and evolutionary changes, while receiving increasing amounts of damage from enemies such as insect herbivores and mammalian browsers.", "The successful establishment and expansion of a non-native species into a new geographic area, resulting in significant ecological disruption and often outcompeting native species for resources and habitat."], "residence time": ["The duration of a non-native species' occupancy in its introduced environment, representing the length of time since its initial establishment, which can impact its interaction with native and other introduced species.", "The duration for which an introduced species remains in its new environment, during which it may adapt to new predator pressures and continue to experience the impact of natural enemies.", "The amount of time an introduced species spends in a new environment, interacting with its natural enemies, before it has had a chance to adapt or establish a stable population."], "geographic spread": ["The process by which the area or scope within which a species is established or present gradually expands and covers a broader territory over time, often resulting in increased interactions with a larger range of native species.", "The gradual expansion of a species' territorial presence into new areas, often accompanied by an increase in population density and a potential decrease in the distance between individuals, allowing for greater interaction with local predators and competitors.", "The expansion or widening of an introduced species' area of occupancy, encompassing the progression from a localized presence to a more widespread distribution, often accompanied by a concomitant increase in population density."], "range size": ["The distance or spatial extent over which an introduced species is dispersed, as measured by the geographic bounds of its presence in an area, with longer distances or greater extent potentially indicating greater freedom from enemies.", "The extent of area over which a non-native species has spread and become established, encompassing both spatial distribution and geographic boundaries.", "The distance over which a species has spread and become established, quantifying the area in which it is found and its extent of colonization."], "spatial scales": ["The level at which environmental conditions, such as predator and herbivore populations, vary and interact with a species, influencing its experience of harm or stress, across distances or territories that are distinct and separate.", "The relative distances and levels of geographical granularity at which the distribution and spread of invasive species are analyzed and understood, influencing the degree of enemy interaction and damage received over time.", "The distances or areas over which a phenomenon, such as enemy release, can be observed, characterized by varying levels of extent and scope, ranging from localized to widespread or regional, and encompassing factors like geographical distribution, territorial coverage, or spatial reach."], "temporal scales": ["The extent or range of chronological periods over which a process or phenomenon is observed to occur, unfold, or manifest, particularly in relation to the duration of an event or the progression of a phenomenon across time.", "The time-based framework within which the dynamic interactions between a species' distribution and its predators or competitors unfold, encompassing both the initial stages of establishment and the subsequent periods of adaptation and expansion.", "The measure of the duration over which the introduction of a non-native species occurs, encompassing the initial establishment phase, the expansion of its distribution, and the potential loss or acquisition of new predators or pathogens."], "invasiveness": ["The tendency of a non-native species to expand its geographic range and establish self-sustaining populations, often at the expense of native species, without being limited by the negative impacts of natural enemies or other factors that normally constrain its growth and
