introduced into other parts of the world, including the southwestern United States.", "A region in the Americas where a particular genotype of a certain virus had previously been detected, and was later detected in the southwestern United States, possibly as a result of the movement of certain species across the continent."], "Arizona": ["A region in the southwestern United States where a virus, specifically St. Louis Encephalitis Virus, has been detected in the local mosquito population and has caused outbreaks, including a significant event in 2015 where a previously rare genotype was introduced.", "A region in the southwestern United States characterized by a seasonal detection of a specific type of virus in local mosquito populations, with the 2015 outbreak in this area being caused by an imported genotype from Argentina, and subsequent years seeing distinct populations with limited transmission between nearby counties.", "A region in the southwestern United States where a particular strain of a specific virus, which had previously been detected in Argentina, was reintroduced in 2015 and has since been periodically detected in local mosquito populations."],

origin point for an initial outbreak.", "A geographic region in the western United States where genetic variants of a certain virus have been found in conjunction with those present in a neighboring state.", "The geographical region to the north of the state that experiences a distinct genetic population of St. Louis Encephalitis Virus (SLEV) genotype III, which is related to a specific group of
