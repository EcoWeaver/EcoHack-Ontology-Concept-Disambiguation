functional unit through the integration of individual species into a complex web of interactions, leading to a stable and resilient ecological entity.", "The process of gradual construction of a collective entity, composed of interacting elements, from a initial state of diversity and uncertainty, through a series of dynamic transformations and adaptations, culminating in a stable configuration that reflects the complex relationships among its constituent parts."], "plant-pollinator community assembly": ["The process by which a collection of different plant and animal species, which are native to an ecosystem, interact and coexist to form a functioning ecological unit, with the plants relying on the animals for pollination and other mutualistic benefits.", "The process of dynamic interaction and adaptation among multiple plant species and their corresponding pollinators, ultimately leading to the formation and evolution of a diverse and interconnected ecological community.", "The process by which species of flowering plants and their corresponding pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, come together to form a cohesive and dynamic ecological unit, with each species playing a vital role in the survival and reproduction of the others."], "native species": ["The fundamental, pre-existing, species that inhabit an ecosystem prior to the arrival of foreign organisms.", "Organisms that were part of the initial assemblage of species present in a given ecological community before the introduction of non-native species, and which have co-evolved and co-existed with each other for a significant period of time, influencing the community's structure and function.", "A type of organism that has historically been present in a specific ecological community and has co-evolved with other species in that community, playing a specific role in its structure and function, before being introduced to or reappearing in the community through natural or human-mediated processes."], "invasive species": ["Species that originate from another ecosystem, migrate into a new habitat, and establish a self-sustaining population, often altering the native community structure and function through competition, predation, or other interactions, potentially disrupting the delicate balance of the recipient ecosystem.", "Non-native organisms that have established themselves in an ecosystem, often with the potential to outcompete native species for resources, alter community composition, and disrupt ecosystem processes, leading to changes in the structure and function of the community.", "A type of non-native organism that enters a community through human activity or natural dispersal, often forming a new community that alters the ecological dynamics of the native ecosystem, potentially causing significant changes to the community's structure and function."], "topological measures": ["A quantifiable representation of the intricate patterns and relationships within an ecological community, often describing the complexity, organization, and interconnectedness of the community's structures and networks.", "The properties that describe the patterns of relationships and interactions between different components of an ecological community, such as the way species are connected or structured within the community, can have a significant impact on its overall functioning and resilience.", "The degree of interconnectedness and complexity within a community, quantifying the relationships and dependencies between its constituent parts, allowing for the assessment of the community's resilience to invasion and disturbance."], "nestedness": ["The degree to which the underlying structure of an ecological community is reflected in the pattern of interactions between its constituent species, such that the relationships between species at lower trophic levels are mirrored in the relationships between species at higher trophic levels, resulting in a hierarchical organization that is more easily disturbed or altered.", "The way in which the structure of a community is reflected in the patterns of interaction and coexistence among its members, with a focus on the way species that are most similar in their ecological requirements are often found to be most closely linked in terms of their relationships.", "The arrangement of species in a community such that the absence or decline of a particular species leads to the decline or loss of others, thereby creating a hierarchical structure of interdependencies, is a characteristic that describes the stability and resilience of an ecological community."], "connectance": ["The extent to which complex relationships between species within an ecosystem, such as predator-prey dynamics or symbiotic interactions, are woven together in a delicate web, influencing the overall resilience and stability of the community.", "The degree to which the
