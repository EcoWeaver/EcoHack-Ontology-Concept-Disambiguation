coastline along the Gulf of Mexico that is prone to larval dispersal by ocean currents."], "breakwater": ["A structure constructed parallel to a coastline, designed to mitigate the impact of waves and currents on the shore, which in this context served as a location for collecting specimens.", "A man-made structure extending from the shore into the ocean, designed to protect a coastline or harbor from the impact of waves and currents, often serving as a hub for marine life to congregate and facilitating the potential for species introductions through larval dispersal.", "A coastal structure designed to protect a harbor, marina, or beach from the impact of waves, built to control the movement of water and provide a safe anchorage for boats and other watercraft, often featuring a series of stones, rocks, or concrete blocks that extend from the shore into the sea."], "La Pesca": ["A coastal fishing village in a municipality of the same name, known for its recreational fishing sites and breakwaters where non-native, invasive marine species have been discovered.", "A coastal town in a Mexican municipality located near a breakwater where a non-native species was first discovered in October 2016, likely introduced through ocean currents.", "A coastal town in the municipality of Soto la Marina, known for its location as a point of access for non-native marine species to enter the
