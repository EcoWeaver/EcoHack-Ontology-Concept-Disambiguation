disrupting the native ecological balance.", "The collective presence of individuals from a different original geographical range, that have been introduced to a new area through human activity,

boundaries, which can lead to the exchange of genes and the shaping of a population's genetic makeup.", "The movement of genetic information from one population to another, facilitated by the dispersal of individuals and the exchange of their heritable traits, resulting in the blending of genetic characteristics and the creation of a shared genetic legacy among the newly connected populations."], "genetic variation": ["The unique assortment of biological characteristics, such as characteristics of DNA, proteins, and other molecules, that distinguish individuals within a population, group, or species from one another.", "The unique characteristics or traits present in the DNA of a population of organisms, which can be attributed to differences in their ancestry or adaptations to their environment, allowing individuals to exhibit distinct features and potentially contribute to the population's ability to thrive in a given region.", "The diversity of characteristics that exist among the building blocks of an organism's genetic makeup, allowing for the existence of different forms and traits within a population."], "vector movement": ["The movement of external agents or factors that facilitate the dispersal of non-native species and potentially shape the genetic structure of invasive populations.", "The process by which a conduit for the dispersal of organisms from one location to another influences the spread of non-native species throughout a region, potentially shaping the distribution of genetic variation within the affected population.", "The manner in which organisms are dispersed or spread through a region, influenced by the routes and frequencies of movement taken by agents or means that facilitate their transfer, potentially resulting in the establishment of new populations or the alteration of existing ones."], "genetic connectivity": ["The degree to which genetic variation within a species is distributed and flows throughout its range, influenced by the movement and interactions of individual organisms and other factors, ultimately shaping the population's overall genetic structure and composition.", "The degree to which the genetic makeup of different populations or individuals within a species remains linked or cohesive, potentially reflecting shared ancestry or recent movement, and thereby influencing the overall pattern of genetic variation across the species' range.", "The extent to which the gene pool of a species is interlinked across different populations within a geographic region, reflecting the degree to which individuals from various areas are able to exchange genetic material through various means."], "microsatellite data": ["A type of genetic information that provides a snapshot of the inherited characteristics of a population at the molecular level, allowing researchers to track and analyze the spread of genetic variation over time and space.", "A type of genetic information obtained from an organism that measures the repetition pattern of short sequences of DNA within its genome, providing insight into population dynamics, migration, and historical events that have shaped the distribution of its genetic material.", "Genetic information obtained by analyzing repetitive sequences of DNA that vary in length, allowing researchers to infer the genetic relationships and movement patterns of organisms within a population."], "intracoastal commercial vessel traffic": ["The flow of waterborne cargo or passenger transportation along a coastline, facilitated by human activity, which plays a significant role in facilitating the movement and dispersal of non-native species across a region.", "The movement of ships traveling along the coastline, particularly between ports and harbors, that can facilitate the spread of non-native species.", "The movement of cargo-bearing vessels along the coastline, which plays a crucial role in disseminating genetic material among distant populations of an invasive marine species."], "contemporary distribution": ["The arrangement of a species' genetic variation across its geographical range, reflecting the extent to which recent or ongoing events, such as human activities, have influenced the spread of its population.", "The arrangement of genetic material that exists in a specific ecosystem or population at a particular point in time, reflecting the movement and dispersal of individuals within that system over a relatively recent period.", "The current geographic spread of genetic variation within a species, resulting from a combination of historical and recent events that have shaped the population's expansion and movement."], "invasion history": ["The complex sequence of events,
