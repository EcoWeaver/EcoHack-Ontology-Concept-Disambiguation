a seed to successfully germinate and develop into a viable plant, indicating its ability to propagate and grow in its intended environment."], "seed germination": ["The process by which the initial growth stages of a plant develop and emerge from a dormant state, typically resulting from exposure to environmental conditions that trigger a response, allowing the plant to establish itself and start its life cycle.", "The process by which a dormant reproductive unit contained in a plant dispersal package, typically encased in a protective layer, breaks through its encasement and begins to grow into a new plant, often facilitated by environmental conditions that mimic those of the plant's native habitat.", "The process by which a dormant or undeveloped plant part, typically buried in soil, becomes a newly emerged, sprouting organism with the potential to grow and mature."], "hair clumps": ["A dense aggregation of fibers, typically derived from the coat of an introduced large mammal, that can carry and potentially disperse viable plant seeds, often in association with the animal's behavior or activities.", "Coalesced tufts of fibers removed from the coats of introduced large ungulates, which can harbor and transport viable seeds.", "Masses of animal-derived fibers that have accumulated seedlings or seeds, often as a result of grooming, nesting, or foraging

accumulation of debris and vegetation.", "Shallow depressions or excavations in the ground, often formed by the digging or rolling of large animals, that can harbor various substances such as mud, water, and debris.", "The areas on the ground where large herbivores engage in repeated acts of scraping and lying down, often resulting in compacted soil and a concentration of hair, manure, and other detritus."], "bison dung": ["The natural waste product of a large, hoofed mammal that serves as a potential vector for the dispersal of non-native plant seeds, containing a small number of
