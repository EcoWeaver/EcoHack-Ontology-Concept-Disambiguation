colonization and potentially leading to the dominant presence of the initial colonizer.", "The phenomenon by which the first individuals to arrive at a new location, often those with a small founding population, establish a stronghold and outcompete subsequent arrivals, effectively blocking their entry and influencing the subsequent success or failure of other organisms attempting to colonize the

proliferation of subsequent generations within a given area, effectively enabling the maintenance and exchange of genetic material across different population patches.", "The extent to which the successful movement of individuals or colonizers from one area to another is matched by the ability of those individuals to establish and maintain a presence in the new location, often leading to the

that allows them to outcompete later-arriving individuals for resources and habitat.", "The initial settlers that establish a foothold in a new area, allowing them to monopolize resources and stifle
