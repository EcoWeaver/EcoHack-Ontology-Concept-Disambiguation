wood and other cellulose-based materials, often causing significant damage and posing a threat to structures and ecosystems.", "A small, social insect that infests wood and other cellulose-based materials, often causing significant damage and economic losses, with some species being invasive and difficult to eradicate."], "drywood termite": ["A type of termite that infests dry wood and is known for its ability to survive in areas with low moisture, characterized by its small size, dark brown to black color, and preference for feeding on untreated wood.", "A type of termite that obtains its moisture and nutrients from wood, without the need for a subterranean environment, and is capable of surviving for extended periods of time without direct access to water or other external sources.", "A type of termite that infests and feeds on dry, non-living wood, often causing significant damage to buildings, furniture, and other wood products."], "invasive species": ["A species that originates from outside a region or ecosystem, which subsequently spreads and causes harm to the native environment, economy, and human populations, through its reproductive and feeding activities, often disrupting the delicate balance of the ecosystem and threatening the survival of native species.", "Organisms that expand their geographic range beyond their natural boundaries, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering ecosystem dynamics, with potentially severe consequences for the invaded environment and its inhabitants.", "A species that thrives and spreads in an ecosystem where it is not native, often causing significant harm to the environment, economy, and human well-being, and can be difficult or costly to control or eradicate."], "fumigation": ["The process of using a controlled atmosphere, typically within a confined space, to eliminate insects and other pests by exposing them to a lethal gas, often with negative environmental consequences and limited effectiveness in preventing reinfestation.", "The process of destroying or exterminating insects and other pests by introducing a gas or other substance that asphyxiates or poisons them, often used as a measure to eliminate termite infestations in structures.", "The process of exposing a structure or area to a controlled atmosphere that is lethal to pests, commonly used as a method to eliminate infestations, but has drawbacks including significant environmental impacts and limited long-term effectiveness."], "environmental effect": ["The unintended and often undesirable consequences that result from the implementation of a measure aimed at resolving an environmental problem, which can have a lasting impact on the natural balance of an ecosystem.", "A undesirable alteration to the natural balance or harmony of ecosystems and organisms caused by human activities, in this case, a significant influence resulting from the use of a method of termite control, leading to potential long-term consequences for the environment.", "Harm or impairment caused by the application of a chemical control method, such as fumigation, that extends beyond the immediate area of treatment and affects non-target species, habitats, or ecosystems."], "heat treatment": ["A method of controlling pest populations by exposing them to a specifically designed temperature regime, typically involving brief and targeted exposures to elevated temperatures, to disrupt their biology and survival.", "A method of pest control that involves exposing an infested area to a precisely controlled temperature for a specific duration to kill or incapacitate the targeted insects, while minimizing harm to the surrounding environment and structures.", "A method of pest control that involves exposing an invasive species to a precise temperature range for a specific duration, resulting in the mortality of the insects, and offering an alternative to traditional eradication methods."], "gut fauna": ["The microscopic organisms living inside the digestive system of an insect, which play a crucial role in its nutritional process and overall survival.", "The microorganisms
