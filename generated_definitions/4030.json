processes affects their outcomes, describing the way in which patterns or relationships between species or factors change or persist over time."], "cellular automata": ["A mathematical modeling approach that mimics the behavior of complex systems by dividing them into tiny, interacting units that follow simple rules, allowing researchers to simulate and predict the emergence of patterns and

presence or abundance of non-indigenous species to relate inversely to that of indigenous species, initially reflecting a dynamic of competition or exclusion.", "The statistical relationship between the initial distribution of local species and the subsequent colonization of newcomers in an ecological setting, where a decrease in the abundance of the initial species is often associated with an increase in the abundance of the newcomers.", "The statistical relationship between the abundance or density of species that are already established in an ecosystem, and the likelihood of new species entering and becoming established in that ecosystem."], "disturbance": ["The sudden or gradual alteration of an ecological environment, resulting in a reduction of native species densities, which in turn affects the probability of invaders colonizing the area.", "A process that disrupts the balance of native and exotic populations, ultimately influencing their dynamics and interactions over time.", "The unpredictable and potentially abrupt change in environmental conditions that triggers a cascade of effects on native and exotic populations, ultimately influencing their correlation over time."], "dispersal": ["The process by which a population spreads its members across a geographic area, potentially occupying previously uncolonized zones, and is influenced by the interaction between the existing native species and the invasive species.", "The spread or dissemination of individuals or populations from a focal area to other locations through migration or the movement of propagules, allowing them to establish new colonies or expand their range over time.", "The process by which populations or individuals move away from their original location, potentially influencing the structure and composition of the surrounding environment, and in turn, impacting the dynamics of native and invasive species."], "recolonization": ["The process by which areas that have been previously colonized by a population become repopulated by members of that same population, often as a result of population fluctuations, disturbance events, or external influences.", "The process by which a diminished or absent population of a native species re-establishes itself in a previously occupied area after being driven out or decimated by the introduction of an exotic species.", "The natural replenishment of a population that had been depleted or extirpated from a particular area, often following a disturbance or environmental change, allowing for a re-establishment of a balanced community structure."], "fecundity": ["The reproductive potential of an organism, measured by its ability to produce offspring at a rate that allows it to rapidly colonize and spread throughout its

time.", "The ability of an invading species to multiply rapidly and spread widely through its new environment, thereby influencing the pace at which it interacts with native species over time."],
