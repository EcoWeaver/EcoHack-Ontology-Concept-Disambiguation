{"alien species": ["A non-native organism that is introduced to a new environment through human activity, thereby altering the native ecosystem and posing a potential threat to its biodiversity and ecological balance.", "A species that originates from a geographical area where it has never been previously recorded or documented as present, and which is subsequently introduced to a new area through human activity or natural dispersal.", "Species whose introduction to a new region or ecosystem through human activity constitutes a departure from their natural geographic range, and whose presence can potentially disrupt native ecosystems."], "biosecurity interventions": ["Measures designed to prevent, contain, or mitigate the adverse ecological and economic impacts of non-native species on ecosystems and human societies.", "Strategies implemented to mitigate the potential harm caused by non-native organisms that threaten the integrity and sustainability of ecosystems, by monitoring and controlling their introduction and spread.", "Measures designed to prevent the intentional or unintentional transfer of non-native organisms from their natural habitat to areas where they could cause harm to the environment, economy, or human health."], "invasion history": ["The documented occurrence of a non-native species in a particular region or area, often serving as a basis for predicting the likelihood of similar species to become established in the same or nearby regions.", "The cumulative record of instances where non-native organisms have successfully established and spread in a given region or ecosystem, often serving as a basis for predicting and mitigating future invasions.", "The record of previously encountered and documented occurrences of non-native species that have established populations in a particular area, providing a basis for predicting and preparing for future introductions."], "native range": ["The area where a species originated, from which it has historically been contained and has had limited potential for dispersal or introduction into other regions, and whose environmental conditions and ecological interactions have shaped its evolutionary history.", "The area or territory where a species first evolved and originally occurs, which can subsequently become connected to other regions through human activities, allowing for the potential spread and establishment of the species in these new areas.", "The original or native environment from which a species has been introduced to a new area, often unintentionally, through human activity or natural means."], "source species pools": ["A collection of non-native species residing in a specific geographic region, which can be easily introduced to other regions due to human activity, climate change, or other factors, potentially becoming invasive in their new habitats.", "A collection of species originating from a particular geographic region that are readily accessible and have the potential to be introduced into new areas through human activity.", "The aggregate collection of untapped ecological niches that contain species previously unknown to humans, whose populations are being disturbed or disrupted due to environmental, technological, or human-induced changes, leading to the possibility of these species being introduced and establishing themselves in new regions."]}
