{"ex situ conservation": ["The preservation and propagation of threatened or endangered species outside of their natural habitats, through controlled and managed environments, with the goal of maintaining genetic diversity and reducing the risk of extinction, thereby contributing to global biodiversity conservation efforts.", "Conservation efforts that take place outside of natural habitats, using controlled environments such as zoos, breeding centers, or botanical gardens to maintain and propagate endangered or threatened species.", "The intentional preservation and breeding of threatened or endangered species outside their natural habitats, typically in controlled environments such as zoos, breeding centers, or aquaria, in order to maintain healthy populations and potentially reintroduce them to the wild."], "zoological gardens": ["Institutions that house and maintain animal collections for scientific, educational, and conservation purposes, often featuring public exhibits and engaging in breeding programs for the preservation of endangered species.", "Establishments that provide a controlled environment for the conservation, research, and display of a

dedicated to the maintenance and display of marine and freshwater aquatic life, often in controlled environments, which play a crucial role in conservation efforts.", "Institutions that maintain aquatic environments for the conservation and display of marine and freshwater species, often in conjunction with zoological gardens.", "Public institutions dedicated to the housing and display of marine and freshwater aquatic species, often in conjunction with zoological gardens, for educational, research, and conservation purposes."], "biodiversity": ["The variety and richness of natural life
