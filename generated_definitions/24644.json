behavior, and interactions within a particular ecosystem or environment, with the goal of understanding their role in shaping and being shaped by that environment.", "The systematic documentation and analysis of the plant species that occur within a specific geographic area or ecosystem, focusing on their distribution, abundance, and interactions."], "vascular plants": ["The type of plants that produce vessels or tubes within their cells, often characterized by complex vascular tissue that transports nutrients and water throughout the plant, and which comprise the majority of plant species found in temperate and tropical ecosystems.", "Plants with structures that conduct water and nutrients from roots to leaves and other parts, and have vascular tissue consisting of xylem and phloem, typically including trees, shrubs, and herbaceous perennials.", "Plants that possess vessels or tubes that transport water and nutrients from roots to various parts of the plant, and have conductive tissues that enable the flow of sap, are a distinct category of flora that are often studied in ecological and botanical research."], "invasive species": ["A type of non-native plant that has been accidentally or intentionally introduced to an ecosystem, where it grows unchecked and dominates native vegetation, threatening the native species' survival and altering the ecosystem's structure and function.", "A type of plant species that originates from outside its native environment and grows uncontrollably, occupying and altering the natural balance of a ecosystem, often outcompeting native species for resources and habitat.", "A non-native plant that establishes itself in a new ecosystem, outcompetes native species for resources, and alters the native plant community structure, typically without natural predators or other controlling mechanisms to regulate its spread."], "forest types": ["A grouping of forests based on their distinct structural and compositional characteristics, which can influence the likelihood of introduction, establishment, and dominance of non-native plant species.", "Areas characterized by a dominant composition of vascular plant species that have adapted to specific environmental conditions and are categorized based on their unique combinations of vegetation structure, species presence, and ecological processes.", "Areas within suburban forests characterized by distinct combinations of vegetation, climate, and terrain features that support specific communities of vascular plants."], "introduced species": ["Organisms that enter a new region or ecosystem and begin to reproduce and spread, often outcompeting native species for resources and potentially causing significant ecological disruption.", "A plant species not native to a specific region, yet found growing in a particular ecosystem, often resulting from human activity or unintentional dispersal, which can alter the native species composition and potentially threaten local biodiversity.", "A plant species that has naturally or unintentionally migrated to an area outside its native habitat, often causing disruptions to the ecosystem, and is not intentionally cultivated or controlled."], "feral weeds": ["Plants that have grown wild in a location without intentional human intervention, often forming dense stands and potentially outcompeting native vegetation, and are often considered a nuisance or invasive presence in a particular ecosystem.", "Non-native plant species that have escaped cultivation or deliberate introduction and thrive without human intervention, often competing with native vegetation for resources and altering ecosystem dynamics.", "Non-native plant species that establish and grow in the absence of human control or maintenance, often with a tendency to spread and outcompete native vegetation."], "accidental weeds": ["Species of vascular plants that have unintentionally become established and spread in a particular environment, often without human assistance or cultivation, but are not yet well-established or self-sustaining, often showing signs of decline or vulnerability due to their dependence on favorable environmental conditions.", "Plants that have entered a forest ecosystem unintentionally and are not deliberately introduced or cultivated, but have established themselves through natural means, such as dispersal or human activity.", "Species that, despite being introduced to a specific ecosystem, neither intentionally nor with the intent to spread themselves, still manage to grow and establish themselves through natural dispersal or other means."], "alien species": ["Organisms introduced to an ecosystem through human activity or natural processes, thereby altering the native flora

potentially disrupting the local ecosystem.", "A species that, despite not being native to a particular region or ecosystem, has established a self-sustaining population or presence, often as a result of human activity or intervention, and can exhibit aggressive or unwanted behavior that can disrupt the native balance and diversity of the environment."], "forest cenoses": ["A naturally occurring
