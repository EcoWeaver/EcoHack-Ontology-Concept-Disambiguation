the number of artemia individuals infected with that parasite per total number of individuals in that group."], "native population": ["The population of a species that has evolved in a specific geographical region over a long period of time, maintaining a natural balance with the local ecosystem, and has not been intentionally introduced or introduced recently.", "A population of a species that is indigenous to a particular region or area, and has been present there for a significant period of time without being intentionally introduced or translocated by humans.", "A population of a species that originated and evolved in a specific region or ecosystem, without recent intentional human introduction or displacement, and maintains a natural genetic and ecological relationship with its environment and other native species."], "invasive population": ["A population of organisms that has established itself in a region where it did not previously exist, with potentially significant ecological and biological impacts, and may outcompete or displace native species for resources and habitat.", "A population of a species that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an area outside its native range, where it is not a native or endemic species, and has established a reproducing population, often causing ecological and economic impacts on the environment and indigenous species.", "A population that has been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to an ecosystem outside its natural range, where it may potentially outcompete and displace native species due to its established population size and/or lack of natural predators."], "biogeographical level": ["A scale of spatial scope that examines the distribution and prevalence of a phenomenon across a broad geographic range, encompassing multiple ecosystems and populations, to identify patterns and differences that cannot be observed at a more localized level.", "The level at which the study of the
