producing offspring that contribute to the colony's gene pool.", "The phenomenon where individuals within a colony, typically not destined for reproductive roles, produce offspring that can become reproductively viable, potentially altering the social structure and behavior of the colony.", "The process by which ants that are not the reproductive females of a colony can produce offspring, which can include both females that can become new queens and males that can mate with queens or other females, thereby contributing to the colony's genetic diversity and potentially influencing its social structure and ecological success."], "queen absence": ["The situation where the primary female reproductive individual in a colony is not present, allowing other females to take on reproductive roles.", "The situation in which the typically dominant and reproductive individual in the social group, responsible for laying eggs and maintaining colony succession, is either missing, non-functional, or no longer present, allowing alternative reproductive mechanisms to take over.", "The absence or removal of the female individual responsible for laying eggs in the colony, leading to an increase in the likelihood of worker reproduction and the potential production of males."], "physogastric workers": ["Ant workers exhibiting a distinct body shape modification, characterized by an enlarged abdomen, which is often associated with increased reproductive capabilities and potential changes in their behavioral roles within the colony.", "Ant workers exhibiting enlarged abdomens and possessing a higher likelihood of producing yolky oocytes, often indicating fertile or trophic egg production.", "Female ants with enlarged abdomens, which are more likely to produce fertile or trophic eggs, exhibit a different behavior during interspecific aggression tests and foraging compared to normal workers, and are potentially more important in the reproductive dynamics of the colony."], "reproductive workers": ["In a social insect colony, individuals that possess the ability to produce offspring, often in the absence of a dominant reproductive, and contribute to the colony's genetic diversity and social structure.", "In a social insect colony, certain individuals that have undergone developmental changes to enable them to lay eggs or produce offspring, which is distinct from their typical role in the colony and potentially affects the colony's social dynamics and behavior.", "In a social insect colony, certain worker individuals exhibit the capacity to produce eggs or sperm, thereby affecting the colony's social dynamics and potentially contributing to the colony's survival and success."], "normal workers": ["Individuals of a particular ant species that do not exhibit enlarged abdomens and are not responsible for producing offspring, and who demonstrate a typical level of aggression and foraging activity in comparison to other individuals of the same species.", "Non-physogastric workers with small abdomens, which are typical of the majority of workers in a colony and do not exhibit any distinguishing physical characteristics that suggest reproductive potential, and are not enriched with yolky oocytes, indicating that they are primarily engaged in foraging and defense tasks.", "Ants that are not physogastric and do not exhibit reproductive behavior, instead devoting their resources primarily to foraging and defense tasks."], "male production": ["The process by which a colony's non-reproductive female castes, responsible for foraging and nest maintenance, produce offspring that develop into adult males, often in the absence of a reproductive queen.", "The phenomenon in which certain colony members, typically female, produce offspring without undergoing queen-specific physiological transformations, resulting in the emergence of adult individuals that are phenotypically male.", "The process by which certain workers within an ant colony, in the absence of a queen, develop reproductive capabilities and produce offspring that can contribute to the colony's growth and survival."], "foraging": ["The process by which ants procure and collect sustenance, nutrients, and other essential resources from the environment, often performed by specialized individuals or subsets of the colony's workforce.", "The act of actively searching for and collecting vital resources, such as food, outside the confines of the colony, often requiring collaboration and organization among workers.", "The act of gathering and collecting food and other resources from external sources, typically conducted by members of a social insect colony, in order to sustain the colony's growth and survival."], "defence": ["The act of protecting a group's assets and interests, including food sources, territory, and social structure, through collective efforts and behaviors that ensure the colony's survival and prosperity.", "The capacity of a colony to protect its members, resources, and territory from harm caused by external threats, ensured by the coordinated efforts of its workers and the presence of a queen.", "The collective and coordinated actions of individuals within a colony to protect its internal and external boundaries, resources, and members from threats posed by other organisms, environments, and ecological pressures."], "heterozygosity": ["A genetic trait that reflects the proportion of individuals in a population with a unique combination of characteristics, suggesting that they have developed from a mixture of genetic material from two distinct sources, potentially resulting from the fertilization of an egg by two different sperm or from the presence of diploid cells containing two complete sets of chromosomes.", "The condition where the genetic makeup of an individual includes a mix of characteristics derived from its parents, resulting in a combination of traits that is not present in either parent.", "The state in which the genetic material of an individual contains a mix of distinct genetic components that are present in different proportions, allowing for the
