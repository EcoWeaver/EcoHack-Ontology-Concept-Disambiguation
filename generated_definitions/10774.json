{"introduced species": ["A non-native organism that, once relocated to a new geographic area, colonizes and increases in number before naturally declining in abundance due to a biological factor.", "A non-native organism, intentionally or unintentionally transported to an ecosystem through human activity, which subsequently establishes a reproducing population in a new geographical location, often leading to changes in the native ecosystem.", "A non-native organism that has been deliberately or unintentionally brought into a new environment, often by human activity, and can thrive in its new habitat, potentially causing changes to the ecosystem."], "abundance": ["The amount of entities or individuals of a particular species present within a specific geographical area at a given point in time.", "The quantity of organisms of a specific species present in a particular area, typically measured through repeated surveys or observations over time, which can fluctuate naturally or in response to environmental factors or biological interactions.", "The number of individuals of a species present in a given area or environment at a particular time, measured by regular surveys or sampling, and which often exhibits fluctuations over time due to various biological and ecological factors."], "extinction": ["The process by which an introduced species' initial surge in population is followed by a gradual and irreversible decline, ultimately leading to the cessation of its presence in a particular region.", "The natural or deliberate decrease and eventual elimination of a non-native species from a new environment, resulting in a significant decline in abundance or complete cessation of reproduction, often leading to the disappearance of the species from the area.", "The natural diminishment in abundance of a non-native species that has initially thrived in a new environment, following the initial wave of colonization and growth, often attributed to the influence of native factors."], "Ommatoiulus moreletii": ["A species of introduced millipede that, after an initial rapid population increase, typically undergoes a natural decline in abundance, characterized by its sudden and widespread presence in a new environment followed by a subsequent decrease in numbers.", "A certain type of millipede that is not native to Australia, known for its initial rapid population growth upon introduction, followed by a decline in numbers.", "A non-native arthropod that, following its initial establishment, exhibits a characteristic pattern of rapid population growth followed by a natural decline in abundance, with its decline attributed to the presence of a specific native nematode species."], "South Australia": ["The region where the black Portuguese millipede, Ommatoiulus moreletii, initially thrived and then declined in abundance, and where research was conducted to investigate the cause of its decline, with implications for the control of introduced species in this area and beyond.", "The region of a country, situated on the southernmost coast, known for having received a particular exotic species, the black Portuguese millipede, which initially thrived but later declined in abundance due to the presence of a native nematode.", "A region in the southern part of the country where a species of black millipede, originally from Portugal, was first detected in 1953 and subsequently exhibited a pattern of initial growth followed by decline in population, with research revealing a native nematode as the cause of this decline, having significant implications for the control of introduced species."], "rhabditid nematode": ["A type of microscopic, worm-like creature that naturally inhabits certain environments in Australia and has been found to be a key factor in the decline of an introduced, non-native species.", "A type of microscopic, worm-like parasitic organism that feeds on the body tissues of insects, capable of significantly impacting their populations by reducing their numbers.", "A type of microscopic, non-segmented worm that is native to a particular region and has been observed to have a significant impact on the population dynamics of certain introduced species, ultimately contributing to their decline."], "biological control": ["The deliberate introduction of a natural predator, parasite, or competitor to a non-native species in order to reduce its population and mitigate the ecological or economic impacts it causes, as a means of managing the spread and proliferation of invasive species.", "The deliberate use of natural predators, pathogens, or parasites to manage and regulate the population of a non-native species, thereby preventing or reducing the negative impacts it may have on the environment and ecosystems.", "The deliberate manipulation of ecosystems to exploit natural processes and native organisms that regulate the populations of non-native species, thus reducing their ecological impact and preserving the balance of the environment."]}
