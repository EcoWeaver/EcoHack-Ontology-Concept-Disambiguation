human activity or natural means, end up in a new environment where they can cause harm to native species and disrupt ecological balance.", "A non-native organism that spreads quickly and rapidly dominates native species' ecological niches, posing a significant threat to the integrity and biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems.", "A non-native organism that has colonized and can potentially alter the ecological balance of a freshwater or aquatic environment, often exhibiting rapid reproduction and dispersal capabilities."], "biological invader": ["A non-native organism, unintentionally or intentionally introduced into an aquatic ecosystem, that can rapidly colonize and displace native species, altering the ecosystem's structure and function, and potentially causing significant economic, environmental, and ecological harm.", "A non-native organism that has colonized an aquatic ecosystem and poses a threat to the native biodiversity and ecological balance, requiring swift and decisive action to prevent significant ecological, economic, or societal impacts.", "An organism that enters an ecosystem without evolutionary history in that environment, where it can outcompete native species for resources and habitat, potentially causing harm to the ecosystem's balance and biodiversity."], "containment": ["The initial measure taken to impede the rapid spread of a newly identified aquatic invasive organism, focusing on halting or slowing its advance, pending further assessment of the species' potential for eradication.", "The temporary measures taken to limit the

by a swift and targeted response to prevent its widespread establishment and maximize opportunities for effective management or control."], "eradication": ["The process of eliminating a biological invader from a specific ecosystem by completely removing it, with the goal of restoring the native balance and preventing further harm to the environment.", "The intentional and systematic removal of a non-native organism from an ecosystem to prevent its establishment and spread, with the goal of restoring the native balance of species and ecological processes.", "The permanent removal of a biological invader from an ecosystem, ensuring its long-term non-establishment and preventing any further spread or impact on native species and ecosystem function."], "stochastic dynamic programming

predict the most optimal course of action in responding to the spread of an invasive species in an aquatic ecosystem.", "A mathematical framework that systematically analyzes a complex situation by

minimizing costs or maximizing benefits.", "A decision-making tool that employs a mathematical framework to model the dynamic behavior of a process, in this case, the spread of an invasive species, under uncertainty and with the ability to adapt to changing circumstances, allowing for the optimal allocation of resources to contain or eradicate the invader."], "biological spread function": ["A mathematical representation of the rate at which a non-native organism spreads through an aquatic ecosystem, influenced by factors such as population density, habitat characteristics, and environmental conditions.", "A mathematical representation that describes how an introduced species, such as a plant or animal, expands and disseminates within a aquatic ecosystem over time,
