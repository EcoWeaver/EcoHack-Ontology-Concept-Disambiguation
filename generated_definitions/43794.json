resources that are not mobile and have limited spatial distribution, often requiring specialized adaptations to exploit these resources efficiently.", "Organisms that spend most of their life cycle on land, relying on its resources to find food, often exploiting terrestrial food sources such as insects, seeds, fruits, and small animals, and are particularly susceptible to competition and displacement by invasive species that also rely on these same resources."], "habitat specialists": ["Species that are adapted to occupy specific, narrow environmental niches, often requiring particular combinations of temperature, humidity, vegetation, or other environmental conditions, and are disproportionately threatened by invasive alien species due to the limited adaptability and

particularly susceptible to disruption or loss due to invasive species or other threats.", "Species that have evolved to occupy a unique ecological niche, characterized by a reliance on specific environmental conditions, resources, or interactions, making them more vulnerable to extinction due to changes in their highly specialized environment."], "large-bodied species": ["A class of organisms characterized by their exceptional size relative to their peers on the island ecosystems they inhabit, making them more susceptible to predation, habitat disruption, and competition with invasive species, which may contribute to their increased vulnerability to extinction.", "Species with physically dominant characteristics that render them particularly susceptible to extinction and disruption of ecosystem dynamics.", "Species that exhibit a greater size or mass than their peers, often characterized by their larger-than-average stature, greater energy requirements, and potentially slower life cycles, which may render them more susceptible to environmental pressures and disturbances."], "endemic": ["A population of a species that is exclusively native to a specific geographical region or ecosystem, and is characterized by its unique set of characteristics, such as ecological strategies, functional richness, and adaptations, which have evolved over time to fit
