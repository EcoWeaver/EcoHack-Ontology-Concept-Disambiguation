{"biological invasions": ["The movement and establishment of non-native organisms into new geographic areas, which can lead to altered ecosystems, competition for resources, and potential harm to native species and ecosystems.", "The process by which non-native species, whose population dynamics and ecological interactions have not been shaped by local environmental conditions, establish themselves and spread in a new geographic area, potentially altering the composition and functioning of native ecosystems.", "The process by which non-native species colonize and become established in new ecosystems, often outcompeting or replacing native species and disrupting the delicate balance of the invaded ecosystem, resulting in potential impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem processes, and human activities."], "biodiversity": ["The variety of life forms on Earth, encompassing the richness and complexity of species interactions, ecological processes, and ecosystem structures that ultimately underpin the health and resilience of the planet's natural systems.", "The variety of distinct species, genes, and ecosystems that make up the natural world, and which provide the foundation for a complex web of interdependent relationships and processes.", "The variety of different forms of life and the different ways in which they interact with each other and their environment, which is often considered to be threatened by the presence of non-native species that displace and outcompete native species."], "global change": ["The phenomenon characterized by a complex interplay of alterations to the environment, including changes in atmospheric chemistry, temperature, and nutrient availability, which collectively create new conditions that disproportionately favor the survival, growth, and spread of certain species while disrupting the balance of ecosystems.", "The process of widespread, long-term alteration of the Earth's natural systems, driven by a complex array of environmental factors, which have the potential to significantly impact the distribution, behavior, and ecological interactions of various species, and ultimately, the integrity of ecosystems as a whole.", "The process of cumulative and interconnected alterations in various Earth system components, including the atmosphere, land, and oceans, driven by various human activities, natural climate variability, and other factors, resulting in significant and far-reaching impacts on the planet's natural processes and ecosystems."], "nitrogen deposition": ["The excess influx of a key nutrient, obtained from human activities such as agriculture and industrial processes, into the environment through various pathways, including precipitation, wind, and human intervention, which can alter the natural balance and favor certain species over others.", "The process by which excess nutrients from human activities, such as industrial emissions and agricultural runoff, settle to the ground and alter the natural balance of essential resources in ecosystems, potentially promoting the growth and spread of certain invasive species.", "The process by which excess nutrients from various sources, such as human activities or natural processes, accumulate in the environment and alter the natural chemical composition of ecosystems, potentially disrupting the delicate balance of nutrients and affecting the growth and development of native species."], "atmospheric CO2 concentration": ["The amount of a specific greenhouse gas that is present in the air around the Earth, which has increased naturally over time but has recently accelerated due to human activities and is thought to have significant effects on the environment.", "The amount of a certain carbon-based gas in the air that has increased due to human activities and is believed to contribute to the warming of the Earth.", "The proportion of a specific gas in the air that plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate and is a key factor in global warming."], "physiological traits": ["Characteristics that determine how well an organism responds to and interacts with its environment, such as how it uses nutrients or tolerates changes in temperature and humidity.", "The set of characteristics that influence an organism's ability to survive, grow, and reproduce in response to environmental stimuli, such as changes in temperature, nutrient availability, or light intensity, that can affect its adaptation to novel ecological conditions.", "Characteristics of an organism that influence how it interacts with its environment, such as its ability to survive, grow, and reproduce in various conditions, which can also affect its competitive advantage over other species."], "life history traits": ["The distinctive characteristics that determine an organism's ability to adapt to and survive in its environment, such as growth rates, reproductive strategies, and resource utilization, which influence its success in colonizing new habitats.", "The unique characteristics of a species that influence its ability to survive, reproduce, and interact with its environment, such as adaptations to specific ecological niches, rates of growth and development, and tolerances to varying environmental conditions, all of which affect its ability to establish and thrive in new areas.", "The unique characteristics that influence an organism's ability to survive, reproduce, and adapt in its environment, such as metabolic rate, growth patterns, and reproductive strategies, which can affect its likelihood of success in different ecosystems."], "ecosystem properties": ["The unique characteristics that determine the functioning, structure, and resilience of a specific environment, such as the balance of species, nutrient cycles, and energy flows, which in turn influence the interactions between organisms and their environment.", "The fundamental characteristics that define the function, structure, and dynamics of a natural system, influencing the interactions and relationships between its component parts, and thereby shaping its overall resilience and response to environmental perturbations.", "The intrinsic characteristics or conditions that define the functioning and behavior of a particular environment, determining how it responds to external influences and affects the interactions within it."]}
