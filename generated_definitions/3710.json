suited to its environment over time, despite the presence of beneficial genetic variants, due to the constraints imposed by existing traits and their correlations.", "The process by which a population

historically existed, characterized by a natural adaptation to local environmental conditions, including the presence of genetic variants that have conferred a selective advantage.", "The original or ancestral geographic area where a species is naturally found, where it has had time to evolve and adapt to specific environmental conditions, and where it is not artificially introduced or
