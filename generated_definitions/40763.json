ecological and conservation factors, and require targeted management interventions to prevent a catastrophic collapse in their population size and eventual loss of species diversity."], "introduced species": ["A species that is deliberately or unintentionally relocated to a new environment, where it did not previously exist, often with the potential to disrupt the native ecosystem and interact with native species.", "A species that is brought to an area where it does not naturally occur, often through human activity, and begins to establish a population.", "A non-native animal species that

the introduction of a species is experimentally controlled to study its behavior and ecology.", "A self-contained ecosystem, entirely isolated from other similar systems, of sufficient size to support a population, but not large enough to encompass the entirety of a species' natural range.", "A defined geographic area, separated from larger landmasses by natural or artificial barriers, where the introduction of a specific species can be controlled and monitored, allowing for the investigation of population dynamics at very low densities."], "rodent-free": ["A state where the population of a specific group of small mammals that gnaw and are often considered pests has been eliminated from a particular area, allowing for a controlled environment for the observation and study of the behavior and movements of the species.", "A circumstance where a specific island or area has been cleared of its native mouse population through deliberate eradication efforts, creating an environment where newly introduced individuals can establish themselves and explore without encountering established residents.", "A state in which the island's native population of small mammals had been completely eliminated through a process of deliberate eradication, allowing for the introduction of a new population of the same species."], "spatial distribution": ["The pattern or configuration of individuals
