within the host's body, causing a detrimental impact on the host's ability to produce offspring and potentially reduce its overall fitness.", "The presence and establishment of a foreign organism that reproduces within another organism, causing harm or alteration to the host's physiology, ultimately influencing its life history traits and reproductive strategies."], "reproductive investment": ["The proportion of energy and resources allocated by an individual to producing offspring, as opposed to investing in their own growth and survival, which can be influenced by environmental pressures and parasitic infections.", "The allocation of available resources by an organism to the development and production of offspring, reflecting the relative emphasis placed on current reproductive efforts at the potential expense of other physiological or somatic activities.", "The allocation of resources and energy by an organism, particularly during its reproductive phase, to produce offspring, with the ultimate goal of ensuring the continuation of its genetic lineage."], "fecundity": ["The maximum reproductive capacity of an organism, typically measured by the number of offspring an individual can produce during its lifetime, which is influenced by factors such as age at maturity, rate of reproduction, and reproductive success.", "The capacity of an organism to produce a large quantity of offspring, as measured by the number of viable gametes or eggs it is capable of producing during its reproductive lifetime.", "The propensity of an organism to produce a maximum number of offspring, as measured by the quantity of reproductive material or structures present in a given stage of its life cycle."], "somatic growth": ["The increase in physical size or development of an organism's body parts, excluding reproductive structures, due to energy allocation and resource investment during its growth and development.", "The process by which an organism's physical size and body structure develop and mature, but does not involve the production of offspring.", "The process by which an organism increases its bodily size and complexity, often at the expense of reproductive investment, in order to enhance its survival and fitness in its environment."], "relative gonadal weight": ["The proportion of an organism's total body mass that is dedicated to reproductive organs, providing an index of reproductive investment.", "The proportional amount of energy and resources invested by an organism in its reproductive system at a specific stage in its life cycle, relative to its overall body size and development.", "The proportion of an individual's total body mass allocated to reproductive organs, providing a measure of the investment in reproduction relative to overall growth and development."], "size at maturity": ["The length or extent of a fish's growth and development before it reaches reproductive maturity, as indicated by changes in body proportions or physical characteristics.", "The total volume of the body at the point when an individual is biologically ready to reproduce, which has decreased in the host species over the study period.", "The point at which an individual has developed to a physical state, as measured by total length or mass, that marks the transition from growth and development to reproductive maturity, and where any further growth is minimal or absent."], "life history shifts": ["The changes in a species' physiological or behavioral traits, such as reproductive timing or investment, that occur in response to environmental or ecological pressures, resulting in adaptations that enhance its chances of survival or reproduction.", "The adaptation of an organism's developmental and reproductive patterns in response to environmental pressures, resulting in changes to the timing and investment of energy in growth, maturation, and reproduction.", "The transformation of an organism's developmental pace and reproductive strategy in response to environmental pressures, resulting in changes to its life cycle, growth patterns, and population dynamics."], "decline of stock": ["A marked reduction in the population size or biomass of a species due to ecological pressures, where the reduction is attributed to a combination of factors including but not limited to, exploitation by human activities and the impact of parasitic infections that alter the reproductive behavior of the affected species, ultimately leading to a diminished capacity for population replenishment.", "The progressive diminishment in the population size and reproductive potential of a species, often resulting from a combination of ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic pressures, leading to a decline in the species' overall
