leaf), marking the beginning of a plant's life cycle.", "The process by which a dormant plant embryo, typically found in a seed, begins to grow and develop into a young plant, characterized by the emergence of a sprout or radicle."], "seedling growth": ["The process by which young plant offspring transition from a germinated seed to a mature, established plant, characterized by changes in physical characteristics, such as height and leaf development, as well as increases in growth rate and ability to compete for resources.", "The process by which young plants, newly emerged from seeds, develop and mature, exhibiting physical changes such as increased biomass, height, and leaf expansion.", "The developmental process of a young plant's increase in size and complexity, characterized by the expansion of its stem and roots, and the establishment of its leafy canopy, which ultimately enables it to compete with other plants for resources and thrive in its environment."], "Lactuca sativa": ["A native species of leafy green crop widely cultivated and consumed as a vegetable, whose seeds are susceptible to inhibition and growth suppression by allelopathic effects of certain invasive alien plant species under conditions of heavy metal pollution.", "A widely cultivated, edible plant species that serves as a host for the examination of the allelopathic effects of invasive alien species on its growth and development.", "A leafy green plant species native to the region, whose seeds are vulnerable to the chemical inhibition caused by invasive alien species from the Compositae family."], "Cu pollution": ["The presence of a toxic substance in the environment, derived from the waste of certain industrial processes, that can impede the normal functioning of plants, altering their growth patterns and making them more susceptible to invasion by non-native species.", "The presence of a certain toxic, silvery-white metallic element in soil or water at concentrations exceeding a certain threshold, which can impede the normal growth and development of native plant species, favoring the spread of invasive alien species that are resilient to its adverse effects.", "The environmental presence of a heavy metal that causes toxic effects on plants, bacteria, and animals, often resulting from industrial, agricultural, or mining activities, and which can accumulate in soil, water, and air, exerting negative impacts on ecosystem health and biodiversity."], "Pb pollution": ["The contamination of soil or water by a toxic substance that originates from human activities and has a tendency to accumulate in living organisms, posing a significant threat to the environment and human health.", "The presence of a heavy, bluish-white, malleable metallic element in the environment, often resulting from human activities such as industrial processes, mining, and waste disposal, which can have a profound impact on the growth and development of plants and microorganisms, potentially altering ecosystem balance and promoting the dominance of certain species.", "A type of environmental contamination caused by the excessive presence of a heavy metal that has the ability to inhibit plant growth and alter ecosystem processes, often entering the environment through human activities such as industrial processes, mining, and waste disposal."], "heavy metals": ["Substances of environmental concern that are naturally toxic, resist degradation, and can accumulate in living organisms, commonly found in polluted soil, water, and air, exerting detrimental effects on various ecosystems and biological processes.", "Chemical elements found in the earth's crust that are highly toxic and dense, capable of displacing other elements and accumulating in living organisms, potentially causing harm to their health and development, and whose presence in the environment can disrupt ecosystem balances and pose a threat to biodiversity and human well-being.", "Chemical elements that are dense, toxic, and tend to accumulate in the environment, posing a threat to living organisms when present in elevated concentrations, particularly when they are found in association with the waste products of human activities."], "colonization": ["The process by which an organism spreads and dominates a new area by exploiting favorable environmental conditions, often suppressing or replacing native species, and altering the local ecosystem.", "The process by which a non-native plant species adapts to and thrives in a new environment, often to the detriment of native species, through a combination of physiological and biological mechanisms, including allelopathy, to become a dominant and widespread presence.", "The process by which a non-native organism becomes a dominant and widespread presence in an environment, often at the expense of native species, through a combination of factors including biological and chemical interactions."],
