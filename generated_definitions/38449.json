biodiversity, economy, and ecosystem services.", "Species that naturally inhabit other regions or areas but have been introduced to a new location, such as the Mediterranean Sea, and are capable of persisting and spreading in the environment."], "NIS introduction rates": ["The speed at which newly detected non-native species enter the public domain, influencing the implementation of prevention measures and assessments of their impact.", "The rate at which newly detected, non-native species of concern in a particular marine ecosystem are officially documented and reported, influencing

scientists."], "time lag": ["The period between the initial recognition of an non-indigenous species' presence in a region and its subsequent documentation and public disclosure, which can impact the accuracy of tracking and responding to biological invasions.", "The interval between the initial observation or detection of a new phenomenon and the subsequent official recording or publication of that event, which can impact the accuracy and completeness of subsequent analyses and decision-making processes.", "The period of time that elapses between the initial detection of an event or phenomenon and its official documentation or publication, which can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analyses and assessments."], "species": ["A distinct entity that inhabits a particular environment, possessing unique characteristics and distinguishing features, which can be introduced to a new region through human activity, resulting in the potential disruption

and studied as distinct entities in their ecosystem.", "A living entity characterized by its unique combination of characteristics, exhibiting a distinct set of physical and biological attributes that distinguish it from others of its kind, and occupying a specific niche within an ecosystem."], "taxonomic group": ["A grouping of living organisms based on their shared physical characteristics and evolutionary relationships, used to categorize and classify species within a specific context, such as the identification and reporting of non-indigenous species in a particular ecosystem.", "A classification system used in biology that organizes living organisms into categories based on their shared characteristics and evolutionary relationships, with each category denoting a specific level of distinction from others, thus facilitating analysis and understanding of species.", "A classification system used to group living organisms based on their evolutionary relationships, physical characteristics, and reproductive patterns, allowing for the identification of commonalities and differences among species."], "macrophytes": ["Organisms that are typically large and grow in aquatic environments, such as lakes, rivers, and estuaries, often serving as a food source for various animals and playing a crucial role in shaping their ecosystems.", "Aquatic plants that grow in the ocean
