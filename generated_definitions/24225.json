{"non-native species": ["A species that has been introduced to an ecosystem through human activity, and as a result, is no longer native to that environment, potentially impacting the existing biodiversity and ecological balance.", "Species introduced to an ecosystem by human activities, such as intentional or accidental releases, that did not evolve alongside the native species and may have unintended impacts on the local ecosystem's biodiversity and balance.", "A species that is introduced, either intentionally or unintentionally, to a new geographic area, where it did not evolve and has not historically been present, and can potentially alter the local ecosystem and pose a threat to native species and biodiversity."], "peacock bass": ["A large, non-native fish species native to tropical regions, known for its distinctive appearance and predatory habits, often introduced to new ecosystems with potential to decimate native biodiversity.", "A medium-sized, introduced fish species native to another region, characterized by its predatory behavior and ability to adapt to new environments, which has been observed to have a significant impact on native species populations in a particular ecosystem.", "A non-native freshwater fish species introduced to a new ecosystem, known for its predatory behavior and ability to exploit native prey populations."], "predator": ["An organism that exploits the energy stored in other organisms, typically by capturing and consuming them, through a strategic and usually highly effective means of detection and attack.", "An animal that uses visual and chemical cues to initiate defense responses in other animals, resulting in altered behavior, reduced abundance, or increased mortality.", "An organism that uses chemical and visual signals to manipulate the behavior of other species, often to obtain a resource essential to its survival, such as food."], "native species": ["Species that are endemic to a particular region or ecosystem, meaning they have evolved and lived there naturally over a significant period of time, and are not found in significant numbers in other areas.", "Organisms that have evolved in a specific geographic area and coexist with other species within that area, often relying on the delicate balance of their ecosystem, are those that have a long-term, intrinsic connection to the local environment.", "A species that is indigenous to a specific region or ecosystem and has co-evolved with its native predators and prey over time."], "predator avoidance": ["The instinctive actions taken by prey to minimize the risk of predation, including changes in behavior, physiology, or habitat use, in response to the presence, smell, or warning signals of a predator.", "The adaptive responses exhibited by prey species to minimize the likelihood of capture or harm by a potential threat, characterized by avoidance behaviors and altered interactions with their environment.", "The instinctive response of an organism to detect, recognize, and react to the presence and threat posed by a potential consumer, resulting in altered behavior aimed at minimizing the risk of predation."], "antipredator behavior": ["The avoidance and protective actions exhibited by prey species in response to the presence or perceived threat of a predator, which may involve changes in behavior, habitat use, or physiological responses.", "The instinctual or learned responses exhibited by a prey species to avoid or deter a predator, typically involving visual or chemical detection of the predator and subsequent behavioral adaptations to minimize predation risk.", "The suite of actions taken by a species to prevent or mitigate predation, including behavioral adaptations that allow them to detect and respond to the presence of predators."], "chemical cue": ["A subtle, invisible signal emitted by a predator that allows prey to detect its presence, influencing their behavior to avoid predation.", "A subtle signal emitted by a predator that is detectable by its potential prey, often relying on scent or pheromones, which serves as a warning or alert, triggering adaptive responses or avoidance behaviors in the prey.", "A subtle, odorless signal that is released by a living organism and can convey information about its presence, identity, or behavior, potentially triggering a response in other organisms that detect it."], "prey naivete": ["The tendency for native species to lack a sufficient awareness or response to the presence and threats of a newly introduced predator, leading to increased vulnerability to predation and potentially catastrophic declines or extinctions.", "The tendency for a species to be unsuspecting and unprepared to respond effectively to the presence of a predator that is unfamiliar to it, leading to a heightened risk of predation and potentially contributing to population decline or extinction.", "The tendency for native prey species to underestimate the predation risk posed by a newly introduced predator, often leading to increased vulnerability and potentially even extinction."], "native biodiversity": ["The variety and richness of organisms that are naturally occurring within a specific geographic area, including the different species, populations, and genetic variations that inhabit and interact with each other within that ecosystem.", "The richness and variety of organisms that evolved together over time in a specific geographic region, resulting in a delicate balance of predator-prey relationships and ecological interactions, which are threatened when non-native species are introduced and disrupt this balance.", "The variety and abundance of species that naturally coexist within a specific geographic area, where the populations of each species have evolved together over time, and the loss of which can have significant impacts on the ecosystem's function and resilience."]}
