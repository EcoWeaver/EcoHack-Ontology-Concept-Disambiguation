an invasive species' ability to escape or be released from human-controlled environments is limited by factors such as containment structures, monitoring protocols, and prevention strategies.", "The assurance that the introduced organisms are contained within controlled environments, such as specialized facilities, breeding centers, or enclosures, and are not capable of escaping or being released into the wild, minimizing the risk of population establishment and subsequent ecological impacts.", "The ability to ensure the confinement and restriction of an organism's movement, thereby minimizing the risk of accidental or deliberate release, and preventing the potential for harm to the environment or native ecosystems."], "risk assessment": ["The process of evaluating the potential harm or danger associated with introducing a non-native species, taking into account factors such as the species' ability to establish a population, its impact on the environment and human activities, and the likelihood of successful eradication or containment.", "The process of identifying and evaluating potential hazards or unintended consequences associated with introducing non-native organisms into a new environment, in order to determine the likelihood and potential impact of undesirable outcomes, and to inform measures for mitigating or preventing them.", "The process of evaluating and categorizing the potential severity and likelihood of undesirable outcomes or consequences that may arise from the intentional introduction of alien terrestrial invertebrates for non-biological control purposes."], "structured experiments and observations": ["A systematic and controlled methodology of observation and testing, designed to gather empirical evidence on the behavior, dispersal, and impact of intentionally introduced terrestrial invertebrates in various environments and situations, thereby informing risk assessment and management decisions.", "A deliberate and systematic

consequences of introducing a non-native species into a new ecosystem.", "The deliberate and systematic planning, execution, and analysis of controlled investigations and observations, designed to

found, with the intention of using them for purposes other than biological control.", "The deliberate human act of bringing non-native, non-domesticated invertebrates into a foreign environment, usually for purposes other than biological control, which can potentially harm the local ecosystem and lead to the establishment of a new, invasive species.", "The deliberate transportation and release of non-native invertebrate species, not intended for biological control, into an ecosystem or environment, often driven by human activities such as trade, food, or pet industries."], "pet trade": ["The commercial exchange of small, non-vertebrate animals, often originating from other regions, that are kept and cared for as companions or for display, and are commonly sought after for their appearance, behavior, or novelty.", "The commercial industry of capturing, breeding, and selling animals or invertebrates for human companionship, entertainment, or decorative purposes.", "The
