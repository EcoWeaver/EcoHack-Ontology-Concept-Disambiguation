number of eggs or young produced by a female during a given period.", "The number of offspring produced by an individual or a population, typically measured as a proxy for reproductive success and population growth.", "The measure of the ability of a species to produce offspring, reflecting the reproductive success of individuals within a population."], "adult survival": ["The probability of an individual's continued presence in its population over time, considering the percentage of adults that remain in the population from one year to the next, without necessarily considering the reasons why they may not have survived.", "The probability that an individual, once it has reached a certain stage in its life cycle, will continue to live and remain in its current location without experiencing death or permanent emigration.", "The probability of an individual in a population surviving from one time period to the next, as measured through a specific set of demographic and ecological factors, and influenced by factors such as food availability, predation, disease, and environmental conditions."], "juvenile survival": ["The percentage of offspring that reach adulthood in a specific population, without migration, as influenced by environmental factors such as predation and food availability, allowing for an estimate of the population's ability to sustain itself over time.", "The likelihood that an individual, recently transitioned from the reproductive stage to independence, persists and avoids mortality in its native habitat over a specific time period.", "The probability that a young individual of a target species will reach adulthood within a given time period, without being affected by predation or mortality caused by non-native predators."], "juvenile emigration": ["The tendency of young individuals to leave their original habitat in search of a new environment or resource, which can have a significant impact on the overall growth and sustainability of a population.", "The process by which young members of a population leave their natal area, potentially dispersing to other areas or populations, and thereby influencing the demographic dynamics and long-term sustainability of the population.", "The permanent departure of young individuals from their natal habitat, resulting in a loss of population size and potential reproductive potential, is a crucial demographic process that can significantly impact the long-term viability of a species."], "fragment connectivity": ["The degree to which adjacent populations are able to interact and exchange individuals, leading to a stronger and more resilient network of populations within a fragmented landscape, thereby influencing the dynamics of subpopulation growth and persistence.", "The measure of how well-connected and accessible a certain habitat is within a larger environment, influencing the ability of individuals to move between areas, mate, and disperse, ultimately affecting the stability and growth of local populations.", "The degree to which individual areas or patches within a larger ecosystem are connected and allow for the free flow of organisms, resources, and ecological processes, ultimately influencing the dispersal, movement, and survival of species and populations within those areas."], "stock fencing": ["The confinement of an area by a barrier that excludes large mammals, thereby reducing predation pressure and allowing for a safer environment for small native birds to thrive.", "Barriers or enclosures that restrict animal movement within or between certain areas of the forest, thereby influencing population dynamics by controlling the exchange of individuals between adjacent habitat patches.", "The physical barrier created around a protected area to control or block the movement of animals, thereby maintaining the ecological integrity of the habitat and promoting the recovery of a target species."], "fragmentation": ["The process by which a once-continuous area of habitat is divided into smaller, isolated patches, reducing the ability of certain species to survive, reproduce, and disperse.", "The phenomenon where the ecological integrity of a previously cohesive habitat is disrupted, resulting in the division of its original range into smaller, isolated patches, leading to reduced population sizes and increased isolation among remaining subpopulations.", "The process of dividing a previously contiguous area into smaller, isolated units, which can result in the decline or local extinction of species
