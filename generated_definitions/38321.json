non-native species that has adapted to a new environment and spreads rapidly, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering ecosystem dynamics, posing a significant threat to the natural balance and biodiversity of the affected area.", "A non-native plant species that naturally occurs in an environment other than its original geographic range, and once introduced, can outcompete native species for resources, habitat, and light, often causing harm to the ecosystem's balance and potentially leading to significant economic, environmental, and social impacts.", "A non-native plant species that has successfully established itself in a new environment, often with unforeseen ecological consequences, and can displace native species, alter ecosystem processes, and cause significant economic and environmental damage."], "potential distribution": ["The predicted areas where a non-native species is likely to settle and thrive, based on environmental conditions and the presence of established populations, which can inform prevention and management strategies.", "The region where a species is most likely to establish and persist over time, based on environmental

often including details such as geographic coordinates, timestamps, and environmental conditions.", "Spatial information recording the locations where a particular plant species has been observed, recorded, or documented in the past."], "sampling bias": ["The phenomenon where the distribution of available data influences the outcome of a statistical model, resulting in inaccurate predictions or a mismatch between the modeled outcome and the true underlying pattern.", "The uneven distribution of data points or observations, resulting in an imperfect representation of the true range of environmental conditions that affect the spread of an invasive species, which can lead to inaccurate predictions of its potential distribution.", "A phenomenon that can lead to an imbalance in the data used to create a predictive model, where certain areas or regions are disproportionately represented, potentially resulting in inaccurate or biased predictions of the species' potential distribution."], "model overfitting": ["The process by which a statistical or algorithmic approach becomes overly reliant on the idiosyncrasies of the limited data available, leading to a loss of predictive power and generalizability to unseen situations.", "The phenomenon of a prediction model producing results that are overly complex and overly accurate, fitting too closely to the training data and failing to generalize well to new, unseen data, thereby reducing its reliability and ability to accurately identify future events.", "The phenomenon where a predictive model becomes so tailored to the specific training data that it fails to generalize well to new, unseen data, thereby producing inaccurate or unreliable results, particularly when applied to a larger spatial scale."],
