{"non-native fish species": ["Organisms that belong to a fish group that are not indigenous to a specific geographical area, thereby potentially impacting the native fish population, and are likely to be causing harm to the environment and ecosystem.", "Species of aquatic vertebrates introduced to a particular region through human activity, where they did not naturally occur before and can establish self-sustaining populations, potentially impacting the native fish community.", "Species of fish that do not naturally occur in a specific region, but have been introduced or introduced themselves through human activity, potentially outcompeting or replacing native fish populations and disrupting the local ecosystem balance."], "Wet Tropics region": ["A subtropical coastal region in

including fish, in a fragile and vulnerable ecosystem.", "A vast area in northern Australia, characterized by a tropical climate and lush vegetation, where a variety of native fish species coexist in a fragile ecosystem.", "A vast, humid, and tropical area located in the north-eastern part of a large island, characterized by dense rainforests, coral reefs, and a rich biodiversity, including unique and endemic species."], "Australia": ["A continent characterized by a diverse range of unique aquatic ecosystems, including the Wet Tropics region, which is home to a rich and endemic native fish fauna, where the introduction of non-native fish species from families Cichlidae and Poeciliidae has resulted in established self-sustaining populations.", "The southernmost continent, characterized by a distinct ecosystem comprising eucalyptus forests, coral reefs, and arid deserts, where species from certain families of fish, such as Cichlidae and Poeciliidae, have been introduced and are now established in certain regions.", "The island-continent known for its unique native wildlife and vast deserts, situated in the Southern Hemisphere, featuring a diverse range of aquatic ecosystems including tropical regions with coral reefs and a Wet Tropics region."], "presence": ["The state in which a non-native fish species has been detected or observed within a specific region, signifying its actual or likely presence, often with established self-sustaining populations that may impact native fish fauna.", "The state of existence of a non-native fish species within a defined geographical region, indicated by confirmed sightings, sightings considered probable, or populations that are self-sustaining.", "The documented occurrence or establishment of a non-native fish species within a specific geographic area, marked by a confirmed presence of individual animals or populations, indicating a potential impact on the native fish fauna."], "absence": ["The state of not being present in a particular region, characterized by the lack of recorded occurrences or observations of a specific species within a defined area.", "The state of not being detected or observed in a particular region or area, implying a lack of presence or evidence of a certain entity.", "A phenomenon indicating a documented lack of observation or documentation of a specific non-native fish species in a particular geographic region."], "distributional records": ["Records that document the presence or absence of a particular species in a specific geographic area, often compiled through a combination of published data and expert knowledge, and used to identify patterns and trends in the distribution of species.", "A collection of data documenting the locations and occurrences of specific organisms, providing a snapshot of their geographic spread and presence or absence in various areas, often used to understand their distribution and potential impacts on local ecosystems.", "A documented account of the geographical occurrence of a species, detailing its presence or absence in a specific area, often compiled through a combination of scientific publications and expert knowledge."], "Cichlidae": ["A family of freshwater fish known for establishing self-sustaining populations in foreign environments, often impacting the native aquatic ecosystems.", "A group of fish commonly introduced to non-native habitats through human activity, often exhibiting a significant impact on the existing native fish populations.", "A family of freshwater fish that are popular in the aquarium trade, widely introduced to new regions through human activity, and capable of establishing self-sustaining populations that potentially threaten the native fish species in their new habitats."], "Poeciliidae": ["A family of fish that has established self-sustaining populations in the Wet Tropics region of Australia, comprising some species that are native to the Americas but have been introduced to this region, likely having a significant impact on the native fish fauna.", "A family of fish characterized by a distinctive group of species, often introduced to new regions, which have established self-sustaining populations and potentially impact the native fish fauna.", "A family of fish species that are known for establishing self-sustaining populations in exotic environments and potentially impacting the native fish fauna in those regions."], "self-sustaining populations": ["A distinct group of organisms that thrive within a specific environment without reliance on external supplementation or introduction, demonstrating a natural equilibrium with their ecosystem.", "A reproductive group of a non-native species that has become established in a new region, maintains its numbers over time through natural breeding and dispersal, and is not dependent on continued human introduction or maintenance.", "A group of individuals of a particular species that have established themselves in a particular area, breed successfully, and maintain their numbers without reliance on external populations or ongoing introductions, thereby influencing the local ecosystem."], "native fish fauna": ["A specific ensemble of aquatic vertebrates that have evolved over time to occupy a particular region or ecosystem, often comprising a diverse array of species that are indigenous to the area and play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance and structure of their native habitat.", "A complex assemblage of fish species that have evolved and persisted over a long period of time in a specific geographic area, exhibiting unique characteristics, adaptations, and relationships within that ecosystem, and playing critical roles in maintaining the region's ecological balance and biodiversity.", "The diverse array of fish species that are indigenous to a specific geographic region and have evolved over time through natural processes, occupying a particular ecological niche and interacting with the local environment and native aquatic communities."]}
