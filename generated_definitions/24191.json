{"freshwater invertebrates": ["Organisms that belong to the group of animals that live in water, but are not fish, such as tiny worms, snails, and insects, that breathe through gills, skin, or book lungs and have exoskeletons, often found in streams, rivers, and lakes.", "Organisms that are multicellular, non-vertebrate, and live in water with a pH that is not necessarily saline, often playing a crucial role in the ecosystem and food chain, despite not having backbones or being found in aquatic environments.", "Small, non-fish aquatic organisms that lack backbones, typically living in and around freshwater environments such as rivers, lakes, and streams."], "non-indigenous": ["A species that has been introduced to a region through human activity, often with unintended consequences, and is not native to that area.", "Species that originate from outside a geographic region, particularly in the context of an ecosystem, and are not native to the area in question, thereby posing a threat to the local biodiversity and potentially impacting human activities.", "A species that is not native to a particular geographic region, having been introduced or transported there through human activity, natural dispersal, or other means, often causing harm to the local ecosystem or economy."], "Ebro River basin": ["A large watershed area in northeastern Spain characterized by the convergence of several rivers, including the main river, which flows through the Ebro Valley, a region with a significant economic and ecological impact, featuring a mix of natural and anthropogenic influences.", "A geographic area in Northeastern Spain that surrounds the course of a major waterway and includes the surrounding land and waterways, known for being home to a variety of aquatic life and experiencing human-induced introductions of non-native species.", "A drainage area in northeastern Spain that is characterized by a major river and its tributaries, serving as a habitat for a diverse range of freshwater aquatic organisms, with a significant portion of its fauna comprising non-native species."], "aquatic invertebrate species": ["A group of organisms that live in water, lack a backbone, and are not fish, but are often small and not as well-known as fish, yet play important roles in the ecosystems where they live, such as helping to break down decaying plant material or serving as a food source for other animals.", "Organisms that lack a backbone, are found in water, and are not fish.", "Organisms that inhabit freshwater environments and lack a backbone, often playing important roles in ecosystems but sometimes entering new regions through human activity, potentially altering local biodiversity and ecological balance."], "biological invasions": ["The process by which non-native organisms, typically species not native to an ecosystem, are intentionally or unintentionally introduced and establish self-sustaining populations in new areas, often leading to disruptions in the native ecosystem's balance and potential harm to the environment and human activities.", "The intentional or unintentional introduction, dispersal, and establishment of non-native species in a particular ecosystem, leading to potential harm to native species, altered ecological dynamics, and negative impacts on human activities and economies.", "The unauthorized transfer of non-native organisms into a specific ecosystem, often occurring through human activities, which can have detrimental effects on the native ecosystem and human societies."], "ecosystems": ["A complex network of living components, including plants, animals, and microorganisms, that interact with each other and their physical environment, shaping the processes and conditions of their habitat, and influenced by human activities and natural factors.", "A complex network of interconnected natural systems that support a wide range of biological diversity and provide essential services, such as water filtration, climate regulation, and nutrient cycling, while also being susceptible to disruptions caused by external influences.", "A complex network of interdependent relationships between diverse components, including biological and abiotic elements, that function together to maintain the stability and resilience of a particular region."], "human activities": ["The collective endeavors of individuals and groups to manage, utilize, and shape the natural environment and the ecosystems within it for practical purposes and benefits, such as resource extraction, infrastructure development, and conservation efforts.", "Processes that involve the manipulation of natural resources, such as water, land, or wildlife, for the benefit of human societies.", "The intentional or unintentional modifications, uses, or occupations of land, water, or air that have a direct or indirect impact on the ecosystem or the human economy."], "introduction pathways": ["The routes through which non-native species are brought into a new ecosystem, often unintentionally or intentionally, by human activities or natural processes, resulting in the displacement or harm to native species and potentially causing ecosystem disruption.", "The process by which non-native species enter a new environment, often intentionally or unintentionally, through human activities, transportation routes, and other vectors, potentially leading to ecological and economic consequences.", "The routes or mechanisms by which non-native species are transported and introduced into a new environment, often as a result of human activity or accidental dispersal, potentially threatening the native ecosystem and causing negative ecological and economic impacts."], "invasive alien species": ["Non-native organisms that are introduced to a particular environment through human activity and can cause harm to the local ecosystem and human activities by outcompeting native species for resources, altering the food chain, and disrupting natural balances.", "Non-native organisms that intentionally or unintentionally enter a new environment, often through human activity, and can cause harm to the native ecosystem, economic interests, or human health, requiring monitoring, management, and control measures to prevent further spread and mitigate impacts.", "A non-native species that has been introduced to a new environment through human activity or natural dispersal, and has established a population that competes with native species for resources, altering the ecosystem's balance and potentially causing harm to human activities and economic interests."]}
