ancestry and admixture between different groups."], "mitochondrial control region": ["A specific part of an organism's DNA that plays a crucial role in its ability to pass on its genetic information to the next generation, particularly with respect to maternal inheritance, and is often used as a marker to study an organism's evolutionary history and genetic relationships.", "A region in the DNA

providing valuable insights into evolutionary relationships and population history."], "pseudo-gene": ["A type of genetic material that is a copy of a functional gene, but has accumulated mutations over time, rendering it non-functional and unable to code for a specific trait or function.", "A specific type of genetic element that is present in the DNA of a population, but does not appear to play a significant functional role in its biology, and is likely the result of a historical gene transfer event between different species.", "A specific type of genetic element that is often thought to be inactive, yet retains certain characteristics that are similar to those of functional genes, but lacks the functionality of expressing proteins."], "microsatellite-based analyses": ["A type of
