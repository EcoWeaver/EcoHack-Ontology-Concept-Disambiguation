{"climate change": ["The long-term and gradual alteration of the Earth's temperature and precipitation patterns, resulting in an increase in the ability of some non-native species to adapt, survive, and reproduce in areas that were previously unsuitable for them, ultimately leading to changes in the distribution and composition of local ecosystems.", "The process by which global environmental conditions, influenced by natural and human-induced factors, undergo a significant shift, causing average temperatures to rise and alter the distribution and abundance of species across the planet, ultimately enabling some species to expand into regions where they previously could not survive and reproduce.", "The process by which the average global temperature increases, allowing non-native species to survive and reproduce in regions where they previously could not, leading to changes in species distributions, communities, and ecosystem services."], "biological invasions": ["The process by which non-native organisms that were previously unable to thrive in a particular region due to temperature constraints are able to colonize and establish themselves in that area as a result of rising global temperatures.", "The process by which non-native species that were previously unable to survive or reproduce in a particular region due to climate conditions are able to establish themselves and spread as a result of changes in temperature and other environmental factors.", "The introduction of non-native species into a new geographic area, facilitated by environmental changes, leading to the ability of these species to thrive and reproduce, altering the local ecological balance."], "global biodiversity": ["The variety of life on Earth, encompassing the distribution, abundance, and characteristics of all living organisms, encompassing not just species diversity, but also their interactions, habitats, and adaptations in a constantly changing environment.", "The variety and abundance of different species that inhabit a particular region or ecosystem, encompassing their presence, distribution, and interactions within the environment, which is crucial for maintaining ecological balance and preserving the natural world.", "The variety and abundance of distinct species, ecosystems, and ecological processes that exist and interact within the natural world, ultimately influencing the provision of vital services and maintaining the health and resilience of the planet."], "alien species": ["Organisms that have migrated into a region outside their native habitat, either intentionally or unintentionally, and can no longer be found in their original environment due to environmental or human-induced changes.", "Species that, prior to environmental conditions becoming favorable, were incapable of surviving and reproducing in a particular region, but can now thrive and expand their populations due to a changed climate.", "Non-native organisms that expand their geographic range into areas where they were previously unable to survive and reproduce due to environmental conditions, particularly temperature, as a result of global warming."], "species' ranges": ["The geographic areas where a particular type of organism is naturally found and able to thrive, which can shift over time due to environmental changes, allowing certain species to expand their territory into new regions.", "The area or areas within a specific ecosystem where a particular organism can naturally occur, survive, and reproduce without human intervention or artificial support, taking into account the organism's thermal tolerance and other environmental limitations.", "The geographic boundaries within which a particular type of organism is naturally found and able to survive and reproduce."], "changing communities": ["The ongoing, interconnected process of species' range shifts and population fluctuations, driven by environmental changes, that alters the complex web of relationships among native and non-native organisms, ultimately reshaping the composition and structure of ecological systems.", "A situation where the composition and interactions of distinct groups of organisms within an ecosystem become increasingly dynamic and complex due to shifts in their geographic ranges and environmental conditions, leading to novel ecological relationships and adaptations.", "A situation where the composition and makeup of a biological environment is being influenced by the expansion of non-native species, leading to an altered distribution of species and ecosystem processes, thereby reshaping the interactions and relationships within the community."], "ecosystem services": ["The beneficial outcomes and benefits that result from the interactions between a community of species and their environment, which are essential for maintaining a healthy and balanced ecological system.", "The natural benefits that a complex network of organisms and their environments provides to support human well-being, including processes that regulate the Earth's climate, produce food and clean water, and maintain soil and air quality, all of which are crucial for the health and resilience of human populations.", "The intrinsic value of diverse communities and landscapes, enabling the provision of essential benefits and functions that sustain life, maintain ecological balance, and foster human well-being."]}
