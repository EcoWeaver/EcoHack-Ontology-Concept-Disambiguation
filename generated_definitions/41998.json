tracking of their spread are crucial for mitigating these impacts.", "A vast continental landmass, inhabited by numerous countries with a rich cultural heritage, where a particular species of invasive plant is considered a significant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem services.", "A vast landmass characterized by a temperate climate, diverse geographical features, and a rich cultural heritage, comprising a patchwork of independent nations, where a specific invasive plant species has been observed causing environmental concern."], "Danube": ["A large European river with its banks serving as a geographical boundary, along which a significant introduction of a non-native plant species has been recorded.", "A large river in Southeastern Europe that forms the border between two European countries, along which a rare and hazardous plant species was discovered for the first time in a Balkan country, its presence posing a threat to local ecosystems.", "A significant watercourse in Eastern Europe that plays a vital role in shaping the environment and supporting the growth of various plant species."], "habitat": ["The location where a species typically resides, characterized by
