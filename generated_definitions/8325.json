colony-mates are friend or foe.", "A species of army ant that is native to the Neotropics and is known for its raids on other ant colonies.", "A species of army ant characterized by its raiding behavior, where workers collectively forage in large numbers to overwhelm and feed on prey, and are often countered by aggressive defensive tactics from other ants."], "Eciton workers": ["The castes of a particular species of army ants that forage and interact with other ants during raids, and are susceptible to counterattacks by a specific invasive ant species.", "Adult female insects that belong to a specific army ant species, responsible for foraging, caring for young, and interacting with other members of their colony in a coordinated manner.", "Female ants that are part of a species that is known for its massive raids on other colonies, characterized by their role in gathering resources and returning to their nest."], "bivouac": ["The temporary dwelling place or resting site where workers of a colony return after foraging, often being the hub of activity and communication for the colony, where they exchange information and deposit their gathered food, but is also a vulnerable spot for intruders.", "The temporary residential or gathering area of a social insect colony, particularly where individuals return to rest and regroup after a foraging or raiding expedition, and where attacks or aggression from within or outside the colony often occur.", "A temporary or makeshift gathering place, typically consisting of foraging or scout ants returning to

common origin and typically work together for the survival and reproduction of the colony, often including individuals of the same age, sex, and genetic lineage.", "Worker ants that are members of the same social unit, sharing a common nest and reproductive cycle, and are genetically related to one another, with whom they often engage in cooperative behaviors and defend against external threats

from one insect to another, allowing researchers to study the interactions between species in a controlled manner.", "A method that employs the use of a specific liquid medium to facilitate the
