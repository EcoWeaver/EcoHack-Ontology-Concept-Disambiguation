resource or habitat that benefits a common herbivore, thereby decreasing the victim plant's growth or survival.", "The phenomenon where the presence and abundance of a particular plant species can affect the population dynamics of a different plant species, even if they do not compete directly for resources, but rather through the sharing of a common herbivore that regulates the populations of both plants.", "The phenomenon where one plant species benefits from sharing herbivorous pests with another species, resulting in a relative decline in the latter's growth or survival, due to the
