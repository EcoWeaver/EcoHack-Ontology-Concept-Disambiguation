altering local ecosystems.", "The process by which a non-native species, often introduced to a new region through human activity, successfully establishes and expands its geographic range, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering the local ecosystem.", "The process by which a non-native species spreads and establishes a self-sustaining population in a new geographical area, often outcompeting native species for resources and altering the ecosystem's natural balance."], "adaptive evolution": ["The process by which a species' characteristics change over time in response to environmental pressures, allowing it to better suit its surroundings and increasing its chances of survival and reproduction in a new or altered habitat.", "The process by which an organism's characteristics change over time in response to environmental pressures, enabling it to better survive and thrive in its new or modified habitat.", "The process by which a species modifies its characteristics over time in response to local environmental pressures, allowing it to better survive and thrive in its newly acquired habitat."], "species ranges": ["The geographic area occupied by a particular type of organism, characterized by a spatial distribution that encompasses the habitats and territories where the organism is able to survive, disperse, and interact with its environment.", "The geographical extent or spatial distribution of a biological entity, encompassing the area over which it can be found, reproduce, and maintain its distinct characteristics.", "The territorial scope within which a biological entity disperses and establishes a population, while adapting to local environmental conditions and interacting with other entities, in order to sustain itself and its genetic makeup over time."], "decadal timescales": ["The period of time over which specific environmental conditions, such as climate or geography, remain relatively stable, allowing for the observation of evolutionary changes in a population over a prolonged duration.", "The period of time encompassing the scale at which phenomena occurring in intervals of approximately 10 years
