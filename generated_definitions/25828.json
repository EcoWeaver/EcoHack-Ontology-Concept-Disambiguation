significantly impacting the availability of those resources for the other species, thereby affecting their coexistence and ecological dynamics.", "A situation where one species consumes a significant portion of a shared food source, thereby depleting its availability for another species that relies on it as a primary food source, which in turn affects its ability to survive, grow, or reproduce.",
