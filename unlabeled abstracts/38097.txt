The invasive flea beetle Luperomorpha xanthodera (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Alticinae), potentially noxious to ornamental plants - first record in Poland
Abstract A specimen of a flea beetle collected by plant sweeping from an experimental plot of oregano in Warsaw showed characteristics of the invasive species Luperomorpha xanthodera. This beetle, originating from Far East, appeared in Europe at the beginning of this century and seems to extend its range continuously. So far, it has been noted from England, Italy, France, The Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Hungary but not from Poland. Being polyphagous, adult flea beetles of this species may appear in numbers on flowers of various ornamental plants causing considerable damage.
