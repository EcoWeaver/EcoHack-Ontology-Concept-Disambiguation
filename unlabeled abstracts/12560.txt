First record of South American suckermouth armored catfishes (Loricariidae, Pterygoplichthys spp.) in the Chumpan River system, southeast Mexico
Non-native South American suckermouth armored catfishes brackish waters of the genus Pterygoplichthys are reported in the Chumpan River in the Southeastern Mexico. The Pterygoplichthys in the Chumpan likely dispersed from populations from the drainage of nearby coastal rivers where they were already established. These catfish tolerate estuarine conditions and probably dispersed from the Grijalva-Usumacinta basin through the brackish waters of Laguna de Terminos and then ultimately entered the Chumpan River system. One juvenile and seven adult Pterygoplichthys were collected in the Chumpan River system in December 2014 from a river lagoon some 15 km upstream from Laguna de Terminos. Non-native catfish were not detected in the nearby Candelaria River. Based on their ventral color patterns, the captured adult catfish were identified as a mix of Pterygoplichthys pardalis and hybrid Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus x pardalis. The detection of these invasive catfish in the Chumpan River highlights the urgent need to generate an awareness program to reduce any adverse effects of this invasive species in the basin, and raises concerns that they may disperse to other basins via an oligohaline passageway in Laguna de Terminos.
