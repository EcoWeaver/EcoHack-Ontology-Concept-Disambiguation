Selected invasive species of the Polish and European avifaunae
The present paper defines the potentially invasive and invasive non-native species of Polish avifauna that constitute a potential threat to the biodiversity and the ecosystems. The work describes two pieces of legislation currently in force in Poland that deal with the issue of invasive bird species. At the national level the issue is regulated by Art. 120 of the Act of 16 April 2004 on Nature Conservation, which prohibits the relocation of the listed species and their introduction into the natural environment. At the EU level, the relevant legal act currently in force is the Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 of the EP and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species. An overview of non-native and invasive species is included, which takes account of the Canada Goose (Branta canadensis), the Egyptian Goose (Alopochen aegyptiacus), and the Ruddy Duck (Oxyura jamaicensis). In addition to the species included in the national law, mention is also made of potentially invasive non-native species, namely the Mandarin Duck (Aix galericulata) and the exotic Rose-ringed Parakeet (Psittacula krameri). Using members of Anseriformes as examples, the paper discusses concerns regarding brood parasitism and hybridization of birds. Measures undertaken to control invasive species are mainly limited to monitoring, but they also include trapping and eradication via shooting in certain cases.
