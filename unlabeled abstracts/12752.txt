Watch your step: insect mortality on hiking trails
Hiking may have a negative effect on vertebrates, but the impact on insects is unknown. Large-scale hiking may lead to habitat degradation, the introduction of alien species and the killing of insects occurring in places visited by people. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of hiking on the mortality of insects. Randomly selected hiking trails in the western Carpathians (southern Poland) were surveyed and dead insects lying on the trails were collected. To compare the composition of ground-dwelling insects killed on trails, insects from free-living populations were sampled with ground pitfall traps. The species abundance of insects killed on trails and those caught in traps differed significantly. Apart from common species, rare and legally protected insects were also found on the trails. Trail mortality peaked in July along with increasing hiking activity. Body size did not affect mortality, at either the species or individual levels. Species mobility influenced mortality, with less mobile species being more vulnerable to trampling. Trampled insects remained on the ground for a maximum of 72 h, although 50% disappeared within 24 h. Our results indicate that trail-killing is, to some degree, a random process and that hiking can influence insects by the elimination of individuals. Given the total length of hiking trails in Poland (76 400 km), and the significant human impact on natural areas resulting therefrom, hiking may be having a negative influence on insect populations.
