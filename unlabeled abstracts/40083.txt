Invasive Rodents on Tropical Islands: Eradication Recommendations from Mexico
Central to the growing field of island ecological restoration is the removal of invasive rodents. The lack of information on rodent tropical ecology is a limiting factor for the success of such eradication attempts on tropical islands worldwide. In Mexico, 14 successful rodent eradications have occurred, 6 of them on dry and wet tropical islands, and the others on temperate islands. All recent projects included research components in order to inform management strategies. Here we summarize the main research findings and management recommendations, using the case of Isabel Island to illustrate how efficacy and efficiency of conservation initiatives can be improved when informed by directed research.
