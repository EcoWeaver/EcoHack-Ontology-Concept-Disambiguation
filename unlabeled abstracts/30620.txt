Genetic methods for the control of alien species
The control of alien species populations is a complex but important task in the strategy for the conservation of biodiversity in natural ecosystems, since invaders may cause considerable economic and ecological damage. This study describes the methods for preventing the formation of alien species populations in nature (sterilization and induction of development of unisexual groups and conditionally sterile mutants), as well as control of existing populations of these species (Trojan genes, hybridization with genetically different forms, and changes in the host gene pool for controlling the pathogens). It is concluded that, although genetic methods of the control of alien species are promising, their development is hampered by insufficient attention of the scientific community, economic organizations, and governmental agencies.
