Can the Dispersal Behavior of Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) Inform the Use of Insecticide-Treated Netting to Mitigate Homeowner Issues From its Fall Invasion?
Brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is a serious agricultural pest and can be a significant nuisance when it invades human dwellings during its fall dispersal to overwintering sites. Methods informed by behavioral data to exclude or reduce its entry into buildings are needed. The temporal and spatial distribution of adults on an invaded building was assessed over multiple years, revealing its seasonal dispersal pattern and that its numbers varied by wall aspect. Moreover, its density was higher in recessed doorways than on associated walls, raising questions about its behavioral response to dark, contrasting surfaces. This response was evaluated using black, framed panels of deltamethrin-incorporated netting, non-treated netting, and an open frame with no netting, deployed in pairs on the wall of a private residence. More dispersing adults landed on panels of non-treated netting than on open panels, but there was no difference between panels with treated and non-treated netting. Adults remained on treated panels for less time than on non-treated panels, and most walked rather than flew from both. Adult male and female H. halys collected during the dispersal period were exposed to panels of treated and non-treated netting in a laboratory, using durations derived from field recordings. Exposures to treated panels intoxicated but did not kill them over a 7-d assessment period. The deployment of insecticide-treated netting, guided by the behavior of adult H. halys alighting on buildings, is discussed in relation to potential options to mitigate homeowner issues from this serious annual problem.
