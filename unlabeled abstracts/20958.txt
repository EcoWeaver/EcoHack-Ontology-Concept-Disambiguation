Morphological diversification in introduced pumpkinseed ( Lepomis gibbosus ): assessing trussbased and geometric morphometric approaches
We examined morphological diversifi cation in introduced pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus from Ibe-rian reservoirs using traditional morphometric (TM) and geometric morphometric (GM) approaches to assess the degree of external differentiation among pumpkinseeds occupying four habitats separated along simultaneous di-mensions of fl ow and trophic structure. Results from both approaches showed signifi cant differentiation among pumpkinseeds occupying these habitats. Among functional characters deemed signifi cant in differentiating among morphs, body depth and caudal dimensions were the most consistently signifi cant under the TM approach, whereas differences in the caudal peduncle region were more evident under the GM approach. Recent comparative studies advocate the use of GM over TM; however, our results demonstrate that TM is benefi cial for quantifying differences in specifi c morphological characters, which is the crux of studies in functional morphology.
