Deposition of exotic bird-dispersed seeds into three habitats of a fragmented landscape in the northeastern United States
Dispersal by frugivorous birds facilitates invasion by many exotic plants. We measured the seed rain of ornithochorous native and exotic plants at three habitats of a fragmented landscape of the northeastern United States for 1year. We studied maple-beech forests, old fields, and abandoned conifer plantations. Across all sites we collected 2,196 ornithochorous seeds, including seeds from six exotic species and 10 native species. The majority (90%) of collected seeds were from exotic species. Seed dispersal was broadly similar among habitats, though seed rain of exotic species was higher in old fields than forested habitats. Seed rain was not strongly influenced by artificial perches for most species. However, seeds of exotic species were more commonly found in traps under an artificial perch in old fields. Seed rains for the exotic Elaeagnus umbellata, Rhamnus cathartica, and Rosa multiflora were positively associated with local density of mature plants. Seed rain of R. cathartica was positively associated with abundance of seedlings but not saplings, suggesting that post-dispersal mortality was important. Seed dispersal of the exotic Lonicera spp. was high in all habitats, accounting for 66% of all seeds collected. With the exception of Lonicera spp., seed rain of common exotic invaders was affected by the abundance of seed sources, and these species might be effectively controlled by elimination of local fruiting plants. Fruits of Lonicera morrowii, which has extensively invaded our area, are apparently a common component in the diet of frugivores.
