Invasibility of boreal wetland plant communities
How does germination and establishment of non-resident plant species differ among major types of wetland ecosystems in boreal forest landscapes? We evaluated the invasibility of three boreal-forest wetland types by sowing seeds of six species from the native species pool and followed germination and survival for 3 yr. All species were able to invade all wetland types, suggesting all ecosystems were invasible, and that observed differences in invasion are due to differences in propagule pressure.
