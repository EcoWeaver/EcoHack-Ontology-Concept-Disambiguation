Impact of invasion: A case study on the ecological and socioeconomic impact of Lantana camara (L.) in Abay Millennium Park (AMP), Bahir Dar, Ethiopia
This study was carried out to quantify ecological distribution, abundance and effects of Lantana camara on different land uses and to assess the perception of local community concerning its impacts on environment and biodiversity of the study area, Abay Millennium Park, Bahir Dar. To do so, 20 m x 20 m (trees) inside which is 5 m x 5 m nest plots (shrubs and saplings), and 2 m x 2 m (seedlings) were laid. Vegetation data were collected using purposive sampling technique with quantitative measurements (DBH, density, seedling and sapling count). Furthermore, semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data about its socio-economic and ecological impacts. Results reveal that L. camara has shown highest invasion (82.1%, grassland) and least invasion (34.6%, riverine forest); cultivated land being intermediate (57.5%). Plant species density was high at the lower class (<6cm DBH, 83.94% of total plants sampled). At species level, L. camara exhibited an inverted J-shaped frequency distribution (62.21 %< 2 cm DBH), screening its greater regeneration potential. There was high diversity and species richness with H'=2.6980, S=45 for natural riverside forest, H'= 1.8173, S=28 cultivated land, and H'=0.3446, S=14, grassland. Economic and ecological results revealed that Lantana was perceived as more disadvantageous; therefore the community highly recommends, if possible, its complete removal from the park. Key words: Abay Millennium Park (AMP), landuse, Lantana camara, invasion, biodiversity, socioeconomic impact, ecological impact.
