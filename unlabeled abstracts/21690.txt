On the population of Chromodoris annulata Eliot, 1904 (Mollusca: Opistobranchia: Chromodorididae) off the Mediterranean coast of Israel
The Indian Ocean opisthobranch Chromodoris annulata was first noted off the Mediterranean coast of Israel in October 2009. Early occasional sightings of single specimens were followed by increasingly frequent reports of clusters of specimens. Our findings point to the presence of an established population along the Mediterranean coast of Israel.
