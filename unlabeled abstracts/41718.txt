Role of a Global Invasive Species (GIS), Lantana camara in conservation and sustenance of local butterfly community
Plants sustain several ecosystem functions thereby playing a crucial role in conservation management. Lantana camara an invasive weed has become the common part of a bushes. The mutualistic relationship between this weed plant and butterflies are well known. Butterflies depend on Lantana camara for food, oviposition site, larval development etc. In this context we are highlighting the role of this invasive weed for butterfly conservation and maintaining total butterfly abundance. In this study the species richness highest for the site where the bushes were dominated by Lantana camara and lowest for the site where LCA abundance was low. The butterfly abundance and LCA abundance maintain a strong positive relationship and LCA abundance, species richness and and butterfly abundance are strongly correlated and dominance is negatively correlated with other three variables. So we can use the Lantana camara as a model organism for conservation and maintaining the butterfly abundance in Purulia, West Bengal, India.
