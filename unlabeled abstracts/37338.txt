Resistance of plant community to exotic invasive Mikania micrantha through allelopathy of multiple species
We studied the resistance potential of several common plant species to the notorious exotic invasive plant Mikania micrantha H.B.K. We compared the allelopathic effects of each species and of the mixed extracts of multiple species on seed germination, seedling photosynthetic activity and seedling growth of M. micrantha. Our results showed that each plant was allelopathic to M. micrantha but the mixed extracts of many spp. were most inhibitory. To enhance the allelopathic effects through multiple species may be a good approach to control the invasive plant M. micrantha in southern China. (c) 2017, International Allelopathy Foundation.
