Predation by herring (Clupea harengus) and sprat (Sprattus sprattus) on Cercopagis pengoi in a western Baltic Sea bay
Abstract Cercopagis pengoi is a pelagic cladoceran that has recently colonized the Baltic Sea and the Laurentian Great Lakes and is recognized as a species with the potential to affect natural foodwebs. To study the consumption of C. pengoi by zooplanktivorous fish, stomach contents of herring (size range 52-252 mm) and sprat (57-116 mm) from a coastal area of the northern Baltic proper were examined in parallel with zooplankton samples. The overall proportion of fish preying on C. pengoi was high both for sprat (70%) and for herring (61%), and it accounted for 8 +- 23% and 20 +- 33% of prey dry weight in the diets. The predation on Cercopagis depends on its abundance and on fish size; herring showed a tendency to become more selective for Cercopagis with increasing size. The majority of diapause eggs found in sprat (69%) were immature and appeared digested, while this was the case only for 2% of the eggs found in herring. These results suggest that Cercopagis has become a significant component in the diet of zooplanktivorous fish and, therefore, its abundance may be controlled by fish predation.
