Signatures of Divergence, Invasiveness, and Terrestrialization Revealed by Four Apple Snail Genomes
Data reported in this paper have been deposited in the GenBank database: genome assemblies and reads (Bioproject No: PRJNA523959 for P. canaliculata, PRJNA523958 for P. maculata, PRJNA445755 for M. cornuarietis, and PRJNA523095 for L. nyassanus); transcriptome sequences (Bioproject PRJNA473031 and PRJNA473253). Abstract The family Ampullariidae includes both aquatic and amphibious apple snails. They are an emerging model for evolutionary studies due to the high diversity, ancient history and wide geographical distribution. Insight into drivers of ampullariid evolution is hampered, however, by the lack of genomic resources. Here we report the genomes of four ampullariids spanning the Old World (Lanistes nyassanus) and New World (Pomacea canaliculata, Pomacea maculata and Marisa cornuarietis) clades. The ampullariid genomes have conserved ancient bilaterial karyotype features and a novel Hox gene cluster rearrangement, making them valuable in comparative genomic studies. They have expanded gene families related to environmental sensing and cellulose digestion, which may have facilitated some ampullarids to become notorious invasive pests. In the amphibious Pomacea, novel acquision of an egg neurotoxin and a protein for making the calcareous eggshell may have been key adaptations enabling their transition from underwater to terrestrial egg deposition.
