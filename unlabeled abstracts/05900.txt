Effects of supplementation on intake and growth of nursing calves grazing native range in southeastern North Dakota.
A 2-yr study was conducted to determine the first limiting nutrient for gain in nursing calves grazing native range in southeastern North Dakota. Thirty-two calves (20 steers, 12 heifers) in Trial 1 (169 +/- 5 kg initial BW) and 31 (16 steers, 15 heifers) in Trial 2 (214 +/- 5 kg initial BW) grazed common pastures. Calves were blocked by sex and stratified by weight. Calves were stratified by age of dam in Trial 1 and by pretrial milk intake (MI) in Trial 2. Treatments were nonsupplemented control (CON); energy supplement (ENERGY; 100% soyhulls); degradable intake protein supplement (DIP; 68% soyhulls, 32% SBM); and degradable with undegradable intake protein supplement (DIP+UIP; 80% sulfite-liquor treated SBM, 16% feather meal, 4% blood meal). In Trial 2, 5% molasses was added to all supplements with the ratios of other ingredients held constant. Supplements were formulated to be similar in NE. The DIP and DIP+UIP supplements supplied equal amounts of degradable protein. Supplemented calves were fed individually, with similar supplement DMI. Weight and MI were measured in July, August, and September. Forage intake (FI) was measured in July, August, and September of Trial 1 and July and August of Trial 2. Gain data were analyzed as a randomized complete block and MI and FI as a split-plot in time. Orthogonal contrasts were used to separate means and included CON vs supplemented, ENERGY vs protein, and DIP vs DIP+UIP. No trial effect or trial x treatment interactions (minimum P-value = 0.30) were detected for ADG. Supplemented calves gained faster than CON (P = 0.06). No other contrast differences were observed (minimum P-value = 0.50). Treatment did not affect FI (P > or = 0.55). Forage intake was lower (P < 0.001) in Trial 1 than in Trial 2. A linear increase (P = 0.0001) in FI (kg OM/d and percentage BW) occurred over time. Calves in Trial 2 consumed more (P = 0.004) fluid milk than calves in Trial 1, though no difference (P = 0.28) was observed relative to BW. No treatment or period differences were detected for fluid MI (minimum P-value = 0.23). Relative to BW, MI declined linearly (P = 0.0001) with successive periods. Energy may be limiting weight gain of nursing calves grazing native range in southeastern North Dakota.
