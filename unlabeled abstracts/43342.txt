Prospects for the Management of Invasive Alien Weeds Using Co-Evolved Fungal Pathogens: A Latin American Perspective
Invasive alien weeds pose a serious threat to the biodiversity of natural ecosystems and a significant constraint to agricultural production worldwide. The use of co-evolved natural enemies, a strategy referred to as classical biological control (CBC), has proven to be a potentially efficacious, cost-effective, and safe option for the management of alien weeds. An analysis of CBC of invasive weeds in Latin America is presented, which shows that only 5% of the worldwide releases of agents, overwhelmingly arthropod, have been in this region. Fungal pathogens are increasingly being considered in CBC programmes, and there are now 11 examples of Latin American fungi having been released as biocontrol agents in other regions of the world. In contrast, only three weed pathogens have been deliberately released in the region. Possible reasons for the paucity of CBC programmes in Latin America are presented, despite the presence of a significant number of alien weed species (60 are listed). An analysis of these weeds reveals that many of them could be amenable to control using natural enemies, including nine weed species for which CBC programmes have been successfully implemented elsewhere in the world. In addition, for many of these 60 species, a co-evolved and damaging mycobiota has already been recorded. The prospects for management of invasive alien weeds in Latin America, using co-evolved fungal pathogens, are assessed with particular reference to selected species from the genera Ambrosia, Broussonetia, Calotropis, Commelina, Cyperus, Dichrostachys, Echinochloa, Pittosporum, Rottboellia, Rubus, Sonchus and Ulex.
