Use of multispectral satellite datasets to improve ecological understanding of the distribution of Invasive Alien Plants in a water-limited catchment, South Africa
Invasive Alien Plants (IAPs) pose major threats to biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and services. The availability of moderate resolution satellite data (e.g. Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager) offers an opportunity to map and monitor the occurrence and spatial distribution of IAPs. The use of two multispectral remote sensing data sets to map and monitor IAPs in the Heuningnes Catchment, South Africa, was therefore investigated using the maximum likelihood classification algorithm. It was possible to identify areas infested with IAPs using remote sensing data. Specifically, IAPs were mapped with a higher overall accuracy of 71%, using Sentinel-2 MSI as compared to using Landsat 8 OLI, which produced 63% accuracy. However, both sensors showed similar patterns in the spatial distribution of IAPs within the hillslopes and riparian zones of the catchment. This work demonstrates the utility of the two multispectral data sets in mapping and monitoring the occurrence and distribution of IAPs, which contributes to improved ecological modeling and thus to improved management of invasions and biodiversity in the catchment.
