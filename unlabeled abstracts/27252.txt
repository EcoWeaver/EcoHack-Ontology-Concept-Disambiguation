Long-term changes in semi-arid vegetation: Invasion of an exotic perennial grass has larger effects than rainfall variability
Questions: This paper examines the long-term change in the herbaceous layer of semi-arid vegetation since grazing ceased. We asked whether (1) there were differences in the temporal trends of abundance among growth forms of plants; (2) season of rainfall affected the growth form response; (3) the presence of an invasive species influenced the abundance and species richness of native plants relative to non-invaded plots, and (4) abundance of native plants and/or species richness was related to the time it took for an invasive species to invade a plot.
