Species relative abundance and direction of introgression in oaks.
Successful hybridisation and subsequent introgression lead to the transfer of genetic material across species boundaries. In this process, species relative abundance can play a significant role. If one species is less abundant than the other, its females will receive many heterospecific gametes, increasing mate-recognition errors and thus hybridisation rate. Moreover, first-generation hybrids will also more likely mate with the more abundant species, leading to asymmetric introgression. These predictions have important fundamental consequences, especially during biological invasions or when a rare species threatened by extinction is surrounded by individuals from a related species. However, experimental tests in nature of the importance of the relative abundance of each species on hybridisation dynamics remain scarce. We assess here the impact of species relative abundance on hybridisation dynamics among four species from the European white oak species complex. A total of 2107 oak trees were genotyped at 10 microsatellite markers and Bayesian clustering methods were used to identify reference trees of each species. We then used these reference trees to simulate purebred and hybrid genotypes to determine optimal threshold for genetic assignment. With this approach, we found widespread evidence of hybridisation between all studied oak species, with high occurrence of hybrids, varying from 11% to 31% according to stand and sampling strategies. This finding suggests that hybridisation is a common phenomenon that plays a significant role in evolution of this oak species complex. In addition, we demonstrate a strong impact of species abundance on both hybridisation rate and introgression directionality.
