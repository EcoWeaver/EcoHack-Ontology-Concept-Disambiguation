Morphometry of alien species Pistia stratiotes L. in natural conditions of the Slovak Republic
Pistia stratiotes (water lettuce) is a well-known invasive plant species with distribution especially in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In the Slovak Republic, the occurrence of alien species P. stratiotes has been recorded since 2007 only in the rivers Maly Dunaj and Cierna voda. The aim of the study was to determine morphometric parameters, density and biomass of P. stratiotes in relation to surface water quality in natural conditions of the Cierna voda river on Podunajska nizina lowland. At four sampling sites, the morphometric parameters of individual plants (535 individuals) were evaluated; density, biomass and dry mass were calculated, too. The largest mother plant had a rosette diameter of 47 cm and a root length of 50 cm. The density of P. stratiotes in massive growths was ca. 380 individuals per 1 m 2 and the average biomass 7.3 kg/m 2. In sites with thermally abnormal waters in Europe P. stratiotes occurred throughout the year. In the natural conditions of the study area the species grew only half a year and reached smaller dimensions. The obtained values of P. stratiotes morphometric parameters are comparable with species characteristics especially in Europe. Growth density and water quality have a significant impact on plant size.
