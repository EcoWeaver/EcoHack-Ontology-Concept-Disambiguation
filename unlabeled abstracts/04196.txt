Activated carbon decreases invasive plant growth by mediating plant-microbe interactions
There is growing appreciation for the idea that plant-soil interactions (e.g., allelopathy and plant-microbe feedbacks) may explain the success of some non-native plants. Where this is the case, native plant restoration may require management tools that change plant-soil interactions. Activated carbon (AC) is one such potential tool. Previous research has shown the potential for high concentrations of AC to restore native plant growth to areas dominated by non-natives on a small scale (1 m x 1 m plots). Here we 1) test the efficacy of different AC concentrations at a larger scale (15 m x 15 m plots), 2) measure microbial responses to AC treatment, and 3) use a greenhouse experiment to identify the primary mechanism, allelopathy versus microbial changes, through which AC impacts native and non-native plant growth. Three years after large-scale applications AC treatments decreased non-native plant cover and increased the ratio of native to non-native species cover, particularly at concentrations greater than 400 g m(-2). AC similarly decreased non-native plant growth in the greenhouse. This effect, however, was only observed in live soils suggesting that AC effects were microbially mediated and not caused by direct allelopathy. Bacterial community analysis of field soils indicated that AC increased the relative abundance of an unidentified bacterium and an Actinomycetales and decreased the relative abundance of a Flavobacterium suggesting these organisms may play a role in AC effects on plant growth. Results support the idea that manipulations of plant-microbe interactions may provide novel and effective ways of directing plant growth and community development (e.g., native plant restoration).
