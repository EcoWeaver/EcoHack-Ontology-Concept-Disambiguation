The Legs Have It: In Situ Expression of Ion Transporters V-Type H(+)-ATPase and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in the Osmoregulatory Leg Organs of the Invading Copepod Eurytemora affinis.
The copepod Eurytemora affinis has an unusually broad salinity range, as some populations have recently invaded freshwater habitats independently from their ancestral saline habitats. Prior studies have shown evolutionary shifts in ion transporter activity during freshwater invasions and localization of ion transporters in newly discovered "Crusalis organs" in the swimming legs. The goals of this study were to localize and quantify expression of ion transport enzymes V-type H(+)-ATPase (VHA) and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (NKA) in the swimming legs of E. affinis and determine the degree of involvement of each leg in ionic regulation. We confirmed the presence of two distinct types of ionocytes in the Crusalis organs. Both cell types expressed VHA and NKA, and in the freshwater population the location of VHA and NKA in ionocytes was, respectively, apical and basal. Quantification of in situ expression of NKA and VHA established the predominance of swimming leg pairs 3 and 4 in ion transport in both saline and freshwater populations. Increases in VHA expression in swimming legs 3 and 4 of the freshwater population (in fresh water) relative to the saline population (at 15 PSU) arose from an increase in the abundance of VHA per cell rather than an increase in the number of ionocytes. This result suggests a simple mechanism for increasing ion uptake in fresh water. In contrast, the decline in NKA expression in the freshwater population arose from a decrease in ionocyte area in legs 4, likely resulting from decreases in number or size of ionocytes containing NKA. Such results provide insights into mechanisms of ionic regulation for this species, with added insights into evolutionary mechanisms underlying physiological adaptation during habitat invasions.
