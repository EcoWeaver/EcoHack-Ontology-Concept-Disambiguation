Anisops sardeus (Heteroptera): A new expansive species in Central Europe
Although insects form a large part of the aquatic fauna worldwide, expansive species of aquatic insects are quite rare. Recently, we can observe a tendency to the range expansions in several aquatic insect species. Here, we present the first record of water bug species Anisops sardeus sardeus (Heteroptera: Notonectidae) from Slovakia. This is the northernmost record of this small-bodied backswimmer which is native to Sahelo-Sindian area, extending to Mediterranean. However, the species shows recent range expansion northward in Europe. We document the current distribution of A. s. sardeus in Slovakia and Europe, and discuss the drivers of expansion and possible impact of the alien species on resident fauna.
