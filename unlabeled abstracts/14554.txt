Photosymbiotic ascidians from oceanic islands in the tropical Pacific as candidates of long-dispersal species: morphological and genetic identification of the species
Following the increase in seawater temperatures due to global warming, tropical species may expand their geographic ranges toward higher latitudes, and thus are noteworthy as potential introduced species. Among photosymbiotic ascidians, Trididemnum cyclops Michaelsen, 1921 and Diplosoma simile (Sluiter, 1909) have broad ranges in the tropical Pacific, including oceanic islands. Considering the taxonomic difficulties in identifying didemnid species, it is important to verify the species identification of specimens from oceanic islands and to examine genetic differences between them and conspecifics from continental islands. We examined zooid morphologies and partial sequences of the mitochondrial COI gene of T. cyclops and D. simile from oceanic islands in the Pacific (Bonin Islands and Hawai'i) to compare with those from the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan), continental islands, and Caribbean Panama. The specimens from the oceanic islands were confirmed to be T. cyclops and D. simile. We assume that the colonies in oceanic islands were originally derived from the tropical western Pacific region, where the species richness is much higher than that in oceanic islands. The wide geographic range of these species suggests that T. cyclops and D. simile have long-range dispersal capabilities and broad environmental tolerances and may expand their distributions toward higher latitudes as seawater temperature increases due to global warming.
