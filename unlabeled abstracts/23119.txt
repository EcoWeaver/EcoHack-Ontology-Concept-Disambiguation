Monitoring and dispersal of the invading GracillariidaeCameraria ohridella
The horse-chestnut leafminer Cameraria ohridella is an invasive lepidoptera (Gracillariidae) which has spread throughout Europe over the last two decades. The species can be detected easily because of its noticeable damage to horse-chestnut trees leaves, which allows the easy collection of large-scale monitoring data. It is therefore an interesting model species to study invasion processes, and this review summarizes recent progresses in that regard. The date reported here result from monitoring of C. ohridella population based on pheromone traps and visual observation of damage carried out in Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland and the UK. The patterns of spread measured using these different monitoring method, and the key factors associated with short-distance dispersal (within cities), and large-scale dispersal (across landscapes) are presented and discussed.
