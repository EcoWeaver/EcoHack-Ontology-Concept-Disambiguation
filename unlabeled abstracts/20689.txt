Efficacy of trap and lure types for detection ofAgrilus planipennis(Col., Buprestidae) at low density
Development of effective trapping tools for forest pests and evaluating the key components of these tools is necessary to locate early-stage infestations and develop management responses to them. Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (emerald ash borer) is an introduced pest of ash (Fraxinus spp. L.) in North America. The effectiveness of different trap and lure combinations were tested in areas with low and high density populations of A. planipennis. At low density sites, purple prism traps outperformed green traps and girdled ash trap trees in capture rates (adults per day) and rates of detection of A. planipennis. Also, manuka oil lures, used as a standard lure in a national survey programme, captured higher rates of A. planipennis than did previous standards of girdled ash trap trees. There was no logistic relationship between the detection of A. planipennis on a trap and the diameter of the ash tree from which the trap was suspended, possibly because of the use of artificial lures with these traps. There was also no difference in the mean number of A. lanipennis captured per day between ash species and between vigour rating of ash associated with the traps. However, traps placed in open grown and dominant trees captured more beetles than traps placed in lower canopy class trees. At sites defined as low and high density, there was no difference in the larval density per cm3 of phloem. This suggests that exposure time to A. planipennis has been shorter at those low density sites. By exploiting the trap and tree characteristics that improve A. planipennis capture rates and detection efficacy, there can be future improvement in management of this pest. If detection can occur before infested ash trees exhibit signs and symptoms, there may be a potential for reducing the mortality of ash within stands.
