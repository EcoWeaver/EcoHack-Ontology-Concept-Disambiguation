The impact of defoliation on nitrogen translocation patterns in the woody invasive plant,Buddleia davidii
The influence of defoliation on nitrogen (N) re-translocation and the source for N remobilisation by the invasive shrub, Buddleia davidii Franch. (buddleia) was determined. Eighty plants were grown over two growing seasons, and half were repeatedly defoliated by removing 66% of their leaf area. During the second season, the N supply was labelled with 15N (10 atom% enrichment), to distinguish the use of stored N (unlabelled) from N taken up by roots (labelled) for growth. Defoliation significantly decreased root (39%) and total biomass (26%). Old leaves were the main source of N for remobilisation which was accelerated and increased (by 50% in the second season) in response to defoliation. In spring, root uptake of N increased by 57% in defoliated plants. Thus, defoliation induced changes in N remobilisation and uptake as compensatory growth increased the demand for N. Continued leaf removal decreased the pool of stored N and caused a significant decline in biomass production, especially in roots (39%) and flowers (31%). This has important implications for the efficacy of defoliation as a control measure, as smaller roots suggest a reduced capacity for uptake of nutrients from the soil and reduced flower production may assist in reducing the invasive spread of the species. These findings clearly show that, although the success of B. davidii is associated, in part, with efficient remobilisation of N from storage, this advantage can be overcome by continued defoliation.
