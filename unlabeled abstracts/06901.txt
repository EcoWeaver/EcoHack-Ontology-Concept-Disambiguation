KAP regulates ROCK2 and Cdk2 in an RNA-activated glioblastoma invasion pathway
Aberrant splicing of the cyclin-dependent kinase-associated phosphatase, KAP, promotes glioblastoma invasion in a Cdc2-dependent manner. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Here we show that miR-26a, which is often amplified in glioblastoma, promotes invasion in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-competent and PTEN-deficient glioblastoma cells by directly downregulating KAP expression. Mechanistically, we find that KAP binds and activates ROCK2. Thus, RNA-mediated downregulation of KAP leads to decreased ROCK2 activity and this, in turn, increases Rac1-mediated invasion. In addition, the decrease in KAP expression activates the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdk2, and this directly promotes invasion by increasing retinoblastoma phosphorylation, E2F-dependent Cdc2 expression and Cdc2-mediated inactivation of the actomyosin inhibitor, caldesmon. Importantly, glioblastoma cell invasion mediated by this pathway can be antagonized by Cdk2/Cdc2 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Thus, two distinct RNA-based mechanisms activate this novel KAP/ROCK2/Cdk2-dependent invasion pathway in glioblastoma.Oncogene advance online publication, 7 April 2014; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.49.
