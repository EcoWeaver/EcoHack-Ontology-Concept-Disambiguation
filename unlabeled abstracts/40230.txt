Litter breakdown of invasive alien plant species in a pond environment: Rapid decomposition of Solidago canadensis may alter resource dynamics
Alien plant invasions of riparian zones can trigger bottom-up effects on freshwater ecosystems through changes in leaf litter supply. Riparian zones of ponds are often invaded by alien species, and although these habitats are common, the effect of invasive alien species on ponds has rarely been studied. We performed a leaf litter experiment in a pond and compared within- and between-species variation in the breakdown rates of three native species (Alnus glutinosa, Phragmites australis and Typha angustifolia) and two aggressive alien invaders of riparian zones (Fallopia japonica and Solidago canadensis). The litter of S. canadensis decomposed faster than the litter of the other plants; more than 50% of the S. canadensis biomass decomposed within a week. This contradicts the home-field advantage hypothesis, and we argue that the quality rather than the origin of litter might be the key factor driving breakdown rates. We also reported considerable intra-specific variation; old leaves (collected in spring after a partial aerial breakdown on stems) decomposed two to seven times slower than senescent leaves (collected in autumn just after abscission). The continuous seasonal supply of leaves of different quality into freshwaters may be disrupted by terrestrial invasions, especially if an invader forms monoculture stands and produces a highly palatable litter, as is the case with S. canadensis. This may fundamentally alter the resource dynamics in the pond environment through a rapid depletion of litter mass before the next litterfall.
