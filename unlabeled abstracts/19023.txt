Nature's Apostles: A Model for Using Ecological Restoration to Teach Ecology
The "apostle model" provides an interesting approach to understanding the ecology of invasive species, species at risk, and keystone species. The model was developed in the mid-1990s by the Harvard Business School as a tool to improve the performance of an organization that offers a product to customers. It plotted customer loyalty against customer satisfaction and identified "apostles" as customers who are very satisfied and very loyal who would also convince more customers to buy a product. By contrast, "hostages" are customers with no alternative, and "mercenaries" buy what is cheapest. "Defectors" are not very satisfied and not loyal, so they would readily switch to other products. If we think of the product as habitat and the clients as species, there are interesting parallels between the business model and ecology. Apostles, hostages, mercenaries, and detractors in the business apostle model all have ecological analogues. They can be identified in a "nature apostle model" to offer a unique perspective for students of ecological restoration in high school ...
