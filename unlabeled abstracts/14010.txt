Survival of Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774) in a natural salinity and temperature gradient: a field experiment in a temperate estuary
The invasive bivalve Corbicula fluminea is described as a freshwater species but can colonize estuarine upper reaches. In a 46-day field experiment, the survival ability of the species along an estuarine gradient was tested. Our goal was to understand its tolerance limits in a transitional area and in which conditions a potential invasion in the estuary could thrive, in order to predict the potential threat of the species distribution and settlement along the freshwater-estuarine continuum. The Lethal Time (LT) method was adapted to this field test with success. The population held an adult stock in the most upstream areas of the estuary (salinity <0.5). Dispersal mechanisms allowed the species to be present in the downstream areas, however, with a different population structure as consequence of the interaction of the diverse physico-chemical gradients of the estuary, in particular different salinity and temperature combinations. During winter, the species was able to survive in all test sites, with practically no mortality, while in summer LT50 (median lethal time) changed considerably when comparing the upstream and the most downstream sites [82 days (predicted value) vs. 9 days, respectively]. Still, 100% mortality was never achieved, adding concern to the species invasion potential in this estuary.
