User-friendly and evidence-based tool to evaluate probability of eradication of aquatic non-indigenous species
The gap between practitioners and conservation or environmental management science is difficult to bridge. Managers sometimes use limited scientific information in their decision-making process, mainly because they have little time to review primary literature before making a decision. Making data readily available to managers is expected to improve the overall efficiency of management interventions. Here, we present an approach to develop user-friendly applications for evidence-based management and illustrate the concept by presenting a simple computer program designed to evaluate the probability of eradication of aquatic non-indigenous species.
