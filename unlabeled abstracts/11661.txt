The fitness of the cotton mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis (Tinsley) is reduced after feeding on virus-infected Hibiscus rosa-sinensis
The cotton mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis (Tinsley) and Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMV), serious threats to economic crops and garden plants, have invaded southern China and widely infected Hibiscus rosa-sinensis. Whether an inter-species connection has facilitated the invasion process is unclear. In this study the interaction between P. solenopsis and H. rosa-sinensis infected with CLCuMV was investigated in the laboratory. We observed that 1st and 2nd instar nymphs of P. solenopsis preferred to feed on healthy H. rosa-sinensis leaves, whereas 3rd instar nymphs and female adults had no preference between healthy and virus-infected H. rosa-sinensis leaves. The developmental time of each P. solenopsis developmental stage increased significantly after feeding on infected H. rosa-sinensis leaves (p < 0.05). In particular, the development time for 2nd instar female and male nymphs and 3rd instar female nymphs increased by approximately twofold. The generation time of female mealybugs increased from 25.84 d on healthy H. rosa-sinensis to 32.12 d when feeding on CLCuMV-infected H. rosa-sinensis, and the survival rate decreased from 71.04 % on healthy H. rosa-sinensis to 5.80 % on infected plants. Nymph survival was most affected by feeding on infected plants. Additionally, the fecundity of female mealybugs feeding on infected H. rosa-sinensis decreased by 47.8 %. Thus, feeding on CLCuMV-infected H. rosa-sinensis significantly decreased the biological fitness and invading and colonizing abilities of P. solenopsis.
