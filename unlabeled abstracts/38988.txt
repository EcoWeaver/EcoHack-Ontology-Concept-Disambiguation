First detection of a highly invasive freshwater amphipod Crangonyx floridanus (Bousfield, 1963) in the United Kingdom
The freshwater gammarid, Crangonyx floridanus, originates from North America but has invaded and subsequently spread rapidly throughout Japan. We provide here the first genetic and microscopic evidence that C. floridanus has now also reached the United Kingdom. We found this species in two locations separated by more than 200 km (Lake Windermere in the North of the UK and Smestow Brook, West Midlands). The current distribution of C. floridanus is currently unknown, however, both sites are well connected to other river and canal systems. Therefore, the chance of further spread is high. Genetic analyses of C. floridanus indicate that British inland waters are colonised by the same lineage, which invaded Japan. We recommend further work to assess the distribution of this species and its impact on the local fauna and flora.
