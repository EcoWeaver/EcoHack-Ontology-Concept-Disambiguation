Invasiveness of Campylopus introflexus in drift sands depends on nitrogen deposition and soil organic matter
Question: Does the neophyte moss Campylopus introflexus invade more often in drift sand pioneer vegetations under high nitrogen (N) deposition? Location: Fourteen inland dune reserves in The Netherlands over a gradient of atmospheric N deposition. Methods: A transect study, dispersal experiment and culture experiment were carried out. In the transect study, the establishment of C. introflexus and lichens was measured in pure mats of Polytrichum piliferum, an early succession stage. The overall presence of C. introflexus in the area was also estimated. In the dispersal experiment, fragments of C. introflexus and lichen species were sown in P. piliferum mats at two sites with high and low N deposition. In the culture experiment C. introflexus fragments were grown on soil with different carbon (C) content and N dose. Results: The Campylopus:lichen ratio was positively correlated (r2=0.61) with the atmospheric ammonia concentration. Campylopus began to dominate at an ammonia air concentration of 7 mg m-3, correlated with the overall presence of the species in the sites investigated. Survival of sown Campylopus fragments was significantly higher and the endangered lichen Cladonia strepsilis significantly lower in the site with a high ammonia concentration. Survival of Cladonia coccifera and Cladonia portentosa was high at both sites. Experimental growing of C. introflexus showed significant responses to both C content and N, although C content showed the strongest effect. Conclusions: Growth of C. introflexus is affected by soil C content and N deposition. Inland dune reserves under high N deposition risk loss of lichen-dominated vegetations because of moss encroachment.
