Over one decade of invasion: the non-indigenous cladoceran Evadne anonyx G.O. Sars, 1897 in a low-salinity environment
Invasive species are often in focus in the non-indigenous species (NIS) research while low-abundance species receive relatively little attention. However, tracking NIS dynamics since the early stages of an invasion provides valuable information on the ecology of invasions. In the current paper, we investigated the invasion history and population dynamics of the small-bodied cladoceran Evadne anonyx G. O. Sars, 1897 in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea) almost since its first detection in 2000. The species already was widespread the Gulf of Riga in 2001 and has been found in nearly every subsequent sample collected during summer months. However, the abundance of the species remained low, seldom 100 individuals m- 3 . Both, salinity and water temperature affected the spatial distribution and population abundance of E. anonyx. The species was found to occur only sporadically at salinities below ca. 6. To obtain reliable presence/absence and density estimates on this small-bodied cladoceran, the entire zooplankton sample needed to be analysed.
