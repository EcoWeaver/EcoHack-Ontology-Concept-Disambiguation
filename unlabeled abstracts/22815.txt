Invasibility and species richness of island endemic arthropods: a general model of endemic vs. exotic species
Aim This paper has two objectives. First, we examine how a variety of biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors influence the endemic and introduced arthropod richness on an oceanic island. Second, we look at the relationship between the endemic and introduced arthropod richness, to ask whether areas with high levels of endemic species richness deter invasions. Location The work was carried out on a young volcanic island, Terceira, in the Azores.
