Managing invasive species in the presence of endogenous technological change with uncertainty.
This research incorporates the development and adoption of an induced technology under uncertainty into a conceptual dynamic model to more broadly examine efficient policies for mitigating invasive species infestations. We find that under optimal policy, marginal costs of adopting conventional control measures are equal to the sum of the marginal benefits from development and adoption of new technology, as well as the use of conventional control measures. This result implies that a resource allocation designed for controlling invasive species is not adequate when an induced technology is not considered. Our results also reveal that the shadow values associated with the probabilities of developing and then adopting an induced technology increase as the shadow values associated with the stock of an invasive species population increase.
