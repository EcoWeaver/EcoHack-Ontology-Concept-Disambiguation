Chromosome numbers of invasive species of the Altai Republic flora. II
Chromosome numbers (2n) in 16 invasive plant species from the families Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Caryophyllaceae, Lamiaceae, Onagraceae and Poaceae are reported on the material from the Altai Republic for the first time. Among them, chromosome complements were first examined in Russia for Chaiturus marrubiastrum (L.) Ehrh. ex Reichenb. (2n = 24) and Oenothera villosa Thunb. (2n = 14). Five species: Amaranthus lividus L. (2n = 34), Elisanthe noctiflora (L.) Rupr. (2n = 24), Galeopsis speciosa Mill. (2n = 16), Oenothera biennis L. (2n = 14) and Bromus japonicus Thunb. (2n = 14), were studied first from Siberia. The most part of the species studied are diploids. The general distribution and the history of floristic findings of these species in the Altai Republic are given. The data on chromosome numbers published earlier on the material from Russia are cited.
