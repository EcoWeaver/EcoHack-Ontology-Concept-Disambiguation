Soil drainage facilitates earthworm invasion and subsequent carbon loss from peatland soil
1. Human activities have been a significant driver of environmental changes with tremendous consequences for carbon (C) dynamics. Peatlands are critical ecosystems because they store ~30% of the global soil organic C pool and are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic changes. The Zoige peatland on the eastern Tibet Plateau, as the largest alpine peatland in the world, accounts for 1%0 of global peat soil organic C storage. However, this peatland has experienced dramatic climate change including increased temperature and reduced precipitation in the past decades, which likely is responsible for a decline of the water table and facilitated earthworm invasion, two major factors reducing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage of peatlands.
