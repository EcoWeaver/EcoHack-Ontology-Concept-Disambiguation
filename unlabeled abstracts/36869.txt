Fish size spectra are affected by nutrient concentration and relative abundance of non-native species across streams of the NE Iberian Peninsula
Aquatic ecosystems are strongly body-size structured with a decline of numerical abundance with increasing body size (hereafter, the size spectrum).Marine and lake fish studies have reported consistent variations of size spectra in relation to environmental conditions and biotic composition, but little is known about streamfishes. Accordingly, in this studywe test several hypotheses about the effects of local water conditions, biotic introductions and cumulative pressures (measured as the IMPRESS index) on the fish size-spectrum slope (that is, the linear rate of decline of fish abundance as body size increase in a log-log scale) and the size-spectrum intercept (commonly used as proxy for carrying capacity) among 118 local fish assemblages in streams of the NE Iberian Peninsula. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an extensive river fish dataset is used in a dendritic network to cover systematic changes of size-spectrumparameters.Wefind that the slope and intercept of the fish size spectrum are negatively correlated with nutrient concentration (mainly total phosphorus), with a greater relative abundance of small fishes but a decline of overall carrying capacity. Moreover, fish assemblages with greater relative abundance of non-native species have flatter size-spectrum slopes. In contrast, the IMPRESS index and climate-related variables are poor predictors of the shape of the fish size spectra. This study contributes to better understanding of themain factors structuring fish assemblages in lotic environments of the Iberian Peninsula. We encourage more research on this line to further explore the use of fish size structure to evaluate the ecological health of riverine ecosystems.
