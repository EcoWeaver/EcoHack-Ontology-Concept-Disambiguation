Conditioned taste aversion enhances the survival of an endangered predator imperilled by a toxic invader
1. Even when we cannot eradicate an invasive species, we may be able to reduce its ecological impact. In Australia, a critically endangered predator, the northern quoll Dasyurus hallucatus is threatened by the invasion of the highly toxic cane toad Bufo marinus. Following toad invasion, quoll populations have become extinct across Northern Australia. Toads are continuing to spread, and will soon invade the Kimberley, one of the quoll's last strongholds. To prevent future local extinctions, we need a new approach for mitigating the impact of cane toads on this iconic predator.
