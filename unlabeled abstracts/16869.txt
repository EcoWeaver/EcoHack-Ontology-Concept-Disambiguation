Changes in the distribution of alien plants along roadsides in relation to adjacent land use over the course of 40 years
Roads have become one of the main corridors supporting the dispersal of alien plants and their penetration and integration into native vegetation communities in new areas. The aim of this study was to use data sampled in 1970, 1994 and 2010 in order to check for changes in the spread of alien species along roadsides in relation to the adjacent land use. The results show that nutrient influxes and mechanical disturbance associated with the onset of intensive farming had a significant impact on the spread of the plant species in this study. In general, a significant increase was documented in the spread of species of invasive status. A different trend in the spread of archaeophytes and neophytes was observed in cases in which a road was adjacent to the meadow. Most of the archaeophytes in these habitats spread significantly in the first twenty years, the distribution of neophytes did not show an increasing tendency. The highest rate of expansion was observed for plants propagating only by seed and in the built-up area of municipalities. Plants exhibiting both seed and vegetative propagation prevailed in the vicinity of meadows and forest vegetation.
