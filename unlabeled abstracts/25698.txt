Discovery of imposex in the gastropod Cyclope neritea now invading Galicia (north-west Spain)
A field survey to re-assess imposex and tributyltin (TBT) bioaccumulation in the gastropod Nassarius reticulatus over Galicia uncovered three populations of the invasive species Cyclope neritea, all showing some advanced imposex. One female was found to carry a mass of aborted egg capsules. The TBT pollution, now decreasing in the area, is the most likely explanation for these reproductive anomalies, and it may bear some relationship to the described population dynamics of C. neritea.
