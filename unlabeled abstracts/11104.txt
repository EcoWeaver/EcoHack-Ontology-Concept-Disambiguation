Short-Term Response of a Coastal Wetland Fish Assemblage to Tidal Regime Restoration in Oregon
Abstract Bandon Marsh National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon, completed construction of a large-scale tidal marsh restoration project on the Ni-les'tun Unit within the Coquille River estuary in 2011. To understand the initial effects of restoration construction and establish a baseline for long-term monitoring, we documented the assemblage of fish species 3 y before and 2 y after restoration construction. The overall fish assemblage in the Ni-les'tun Unit was substantially different after restoration construction, with an increased abundance, frequency, and richness of estuarine and diadromous fish species. Threespine Stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus and species of Sculpin (family Cottidae) dominated the Ni-les'tun Unit and control area in both relative abundance and capture frequency throughout this study. Among salmonids, Coastal Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii and Coho Salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch had the highest frequency of occurrence and relative abundance both before and after restoration construction. Fish occupied newly constructed channels within 2 y. Species found in new channels included freshwater species (e.g., juvenile salmonids), introduced species (e.g., Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis), and estuarine species (e.g., Sculpin, Threespine Stickleback, and Shiner Perch Cymatogaster aggregata). Changes were likely due to improved access and changing habitat created by the reintroduced tidal regime. We recommend long-term monitoring to assess the trajectory of the biological response to the restoration over time.
