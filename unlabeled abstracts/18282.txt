New microsatellite markers for the ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tinctorius sensu stricto reveal the genetic structure of US and Puerto Rican populations
The ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tinctorius has been introduced to many areas around the world as a source of inoculum for pine plantations. However, little is known about the genetic structure of fungal populations in their introduced habitats. To study the genetics of exotic P. tinctorius populations, we developed and employed seven new microsatellite markers and compared samples from Puerto Rico (exotic range) and the eastern United States (native range). Bayesian cluster analysis, neighbor joining analysis and FST values all strongly separated Puerto Rican populations from North American populations. Consistent with a founder effect, populations from Puerto Rico had reduced allelic richness when compared to samples from the United States. The genetic structure of P. tinctorius populations in Puerto Rico is weak to modest and is not correlated with geographic distance reflecting anthropogenic movement of inoculum with forestry practices.
