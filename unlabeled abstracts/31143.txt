Effects of filamentous algal mats on sulfide invasion in eelgrass (Zostera marina)
The effect of filamentous algae invasion into Zostera marina meadows on water quality, sediment sulfur pools and sulfide invasion into plant tissues was studied experimentally. Sulfide invasion was assessed through analysis of sulfur isotopic composition (d34S) and total sulfur (TS) concentrations in plant tissues. The algal mats (5 and 10 cm thickness) depleted oxygen in the mats and increased the pools of sulfides in the sediments. Plants exposed to algal mats had d34S signals closer to the d34S of sediment sulfide, whereas plants with no mats present had d34S signals closer to the d34S of seawater sulfate, indicating a higher sulfide invasion in plants exposed to algal mats. The d34S varied between the plant tissues with the leaves having more positive d34S signals than roots and rhizomes, indicating that sulfide was invading into the roots and moved to the other tissues through the lacunae. TS concentrations were higher in plants exposed to algal mats suggesting that sulfur derived from sediment sulfide accumulated in the plants. Fsulfide showed that up to 50% of the sulfides in the plants were derived from sedimentary sulfides. The combined effect of water column anoxia in the lower parts of the meadow and high sulfide invasion into the plants lead to significantly reduced growth rates after 3 weeks and the below-ground tissues showed signs of degradation suggesting that algal mats invasion in to Zostera marina meadows can result in seagrass decline.
