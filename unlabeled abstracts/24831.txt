Australian biodiversity: threats for the present, opportunities for the future
Australia's insect fauna comprises a very large component of its biodiversity, and one that remains a largely unknown and untapped resource. Estimates of global and Australian insect species richness are reviewed, and Australia's insect biodiversity is placed in its biogeographical context of Mesozoic, Gondwanan connectivity and Tertiary isolation. Some unique, relict faunal elements derived from Australia's long periods of isolation are highlighted. Examples of the dramatic insect evolutionary radiations are profiled that are the consequence of successful adaptation to new biomes made available by the environmental transformations in Australia in the latter half of the Tertiary. Then conservation of Australian forests and the major processes threatening Australian biodiversity are discussed: invasive species, habitat conversion and climate change. The four components necessary to build sustainability in Australia or throughout the world are discussed: description and understanding, direct action for conservation, promoting sustainable use in balance with conservation, and providing edu-cation and information to maintain the overall effort.
