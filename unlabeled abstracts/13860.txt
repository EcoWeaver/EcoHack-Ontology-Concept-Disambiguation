The minimum founding population in dispersing organisms subject to strong Allee effects
1.Dispersal can push population density below strong Allee thresholds ensuring the demise of small founding populations. As a result, for isolated populations of dispersing organisms, the minimum founding population size that enables establishment can be quite different from the Allee threshold. 2.We derive an expression for the minimum founding population size for a general integrodifference equation model of a dispersing population with a strong Allee effect. We demonstrate the utility of the general model by using it to approximate minimum founding populations for the mountain pine beetle. 3.The minimum founding population of the general model increases linearly with the mean squared displacement of the dispersing organism. Transient dynamics of the general model suggest that population density at the point of introduction will often decrease before increasing, even when the minimum founding population size is exceeded. 4.Calculation of minimum founding population sizes may prove useful for predicting invasion success based on propagule size and for maximizing the success of species reintroductions when strong Allee effects exist.
