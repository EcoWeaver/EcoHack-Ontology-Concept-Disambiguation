Caprella scaura Templeton, 1836: an invasive caprellid new to the Azores archipelago
The present study reports for the first time the occurrence of Caprella scaura in the remote oceanic islands of the Azores archipelago. Caprella scaura is a widespread caprellid with an invasive potential and a complicated taxonomy due to the existence of individuals that vary morphologically between and within regions. Caprella scaura specimens collected in this study were assigned to subspecies C. s. scaura and C. s. typica, supporting already published evidence that these two names should be synonymized into a single subspecies. Previous C. scaura records were also analyzed in order to provide a more updated insight on current C. s. scaura distribution. The year-round presence of a breeding population in the Ponta Delgada marina suggests that C. scaura is locally well-established. Recent C. scaura presence in a marina and its association with non-native fouling bryozoans suggest that the most probable introduction vector in the Azores is through hull fouling.
