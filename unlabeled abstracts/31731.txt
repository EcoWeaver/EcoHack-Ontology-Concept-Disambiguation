Marine introduced species in Australia, where to from here? A personal perspective from a practising taxonomist
While introduced marine species have been arriving in Australia for centuries, it was the advent of container shipping and the discharge of ballast water into Australian ports that highlighted the problem. A summary is provided of how Australia responded to this challenge and continues to. More recently there has been an acceptance that hull fouling is also an important vector of introductions. A major problem in Australia is distinguishing introduced species from as yet undescribed native species. This is a particular problem in northern Australia where the native fauna is poorly documented. Despite the economic and environmental threats posed by introduced species, the impetus to undertake expensive comprehensive surveys has declined and attention is now focusing on targeted surveys especially of known marine pest species and molecular data to identify introductions. Ongoing research is still needed to monitor other species identified as being introduced and their potential to become pests.
