Floristic Survey of the Vascular Plants of Shenandoah County, Virginia
The objective of this study was to create a comprehensive list of the vascular plants of Shenandoah County, Virginia. Specimens were collected from the field during the 2011 growing season, from March 21 to October 27, and part of the 2012 growing season, from March 22 to May 30. Local herbaria of James Madison University (JMUH), Bridgewater College (BDWR), Eastern Mennonite University (HAVI) and Lord Fairfax Community College (LFCC) were searched for preexisting specimens. The results of the study were compared to records of the Digital Atlas of the Virginia Flora, which currently maps the distribution of vascular plants in Virginia. The combined list based on field collections, pre-existing herbarium specimens, and the Digital Atlas comprises a total of 1,296 species in 568 genera and 142 families. Of these, 57 species are ferns and fern allies, 8 are gymnosperms, 911 are dicots, and 320 are monocots. The records represent 1,009 species native to Virginia, 271 introduced, 12 of uncertain native status, and 2 species believed to occur in both native and introduced populations. Of the 271 introduced species, 61 are considered invasive to some degree. Forty-one species are considered rare in Virginia, and one is endangered at the federal level. This survey resulted in 53 county records, 2 of which also represent state records. Voucher specimens of new field collections are housed in JMUH.
