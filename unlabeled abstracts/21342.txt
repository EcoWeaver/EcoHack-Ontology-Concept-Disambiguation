A review of international, regional and national biosecurity risk assessment frameworks
Aquatic nonindigenous species (ANS) have dramatic impact on environmental, economic, social, cultural, and human health values in a variety of coastal, estuarine, and inland ecosystem. Despite efforts to develop biosecurity risk assessment frameworks for the improvement of ANS management, responsible agencies lack a standardized framework to identify and mitigate risk from ANS. This paper reviews the biosecurity risk assessment frameworks of seven international bodies, four regional bodies, and three countries and highlights the similarities, differences and deficiencies in their respective frameworks. Specific deficiencies found by the review include: (i) a lack of national implementation of the international and regional frameworks; (ii) gaps in ANS knowledge; (iii) insufficient guidance for various components of the risk assessment; (iv) limited number and scope of standards and measures related to ANS; and (v) inconsistent terminology between frameworks. To reduce the risk of ANS introductions, this paper concludes with a set of six recommendations to develop aquatic biosecurity risk frameworks that are both comprehensive and precautionary while also in accord with mandates established by other international bodies such as the World Trade Organization.
