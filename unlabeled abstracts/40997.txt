Mathematical modeling and evaluation of bioinvasion status of barnacles on the shelf of Japan
The results of a statistical analysis of spatiotemporal distribution of the barnacles Amphibalanus improvisus, A. amphitrite, and A. eburneus on the shelf of the Sea of Japan are presented for the period of 1935-2000. The locations of barnacle finds coincide with the areas of huge sea ports and electric power plants. The empirical patterns of barnacle bioinvasion to the Sea of Japan are described under the statistical analysis of sampling data. The computational model of barnacle invasion is developed and analyzed. This model takes into account empirical data and suggested parametric factors, such as natural population growth, intra- and interspecific competition, sea environmental conditions, and natural settling activity, and anthropogenic factors, such as navigation intensity anthropogenic load. The algorithms of population dynamics and evaluation of model adequacy are suggested. Significant concordance between model and field data is obtained.
