Introduced Species of Reptiles in Surinam. Notes on the herpetofauna of Surinam VIII
AbstractHemidactylus mabouia (MOREAU) DE JONNES) is a recent invader of Surinam, apparently still extending the limits of its distribution. Recent introductions of the Hispaniolan lizards Anolis chlorocyanus chlorocyanus DUMERIL and BIBRON and A. cybotes cybotes COPE have led to the establishment of viable populations in Paramaribo. Anolis baleatus (COPE) from Hispaniola and A. lineatus DAUDIN from Curacao, also introduced recently, maintained themselves, but apparently did not (yet) establish large populations. Anolis marmoratus speciosus GARMAN is extending its range in French Guiana and may reach Surinam in the near future. Other recent introductions of Cyclura cornuta (BONNATERRE) and of Epicrates spec., both from Hispaniola, have not led to the establishment of viable populations. Anolis richardi DUMERIL & BIBRON, introduced from Grenada, apparently thrived for a few years, but became extinct after destruction of its habitat.
