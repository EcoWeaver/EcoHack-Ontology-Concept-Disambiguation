A large-scale conservation perspective considering endemic fishes of the North American plains
Regions with unique habitats often harbor endemic taxa associated with temporally stable habitats. We identified such habitats that sustain endemic fishes in the plains of North America. We also summarized threats to their conservation and identified remnant habitats that still harbor endemic fishes (refuges) based on post-1989 surveys. Major springs, smaller, spring-fed streams, larger rivers, and euryhaline habitats were associated with a total of 49 endemics. Endemism was attributable to climatic refugia associated with each habitat type and dispersal limitation among major river drainages and springs. Forty-one endemic fishes (84%) were declining or extinct. Dewatering, habitat fragmentation, and habitat degradation were main causes of declines, often present together. Pollution and non-native species were also threats in many cases. Evidence for 53 existing refuges was found. We considered 34 refuges to be "high-quality" because they harbored three or more endemics. Twenty of these (those with available data) maintained consistent streamflow regimes for at least 50 years up to 2009. Case studies suggest high stream length, more natural flow regimes, and fewer direct human impacts are features of high-quality refuges, but extinction thresholds are unquantified and extinction debts of refuges are unknown. Limited information on past extinctions suggests drought, a natural feature of the plains, combines with other threats to eliminate remnant endemic populations. Long-term conservation planning requires identification, protection, and restoration of high-quality refuges to reduce extinction risk, especially during future drought periods. Planning should be integrated with regional water resource planning, given scarcity of water in the region.
