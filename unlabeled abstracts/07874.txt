Catalogue of the exotic armoured scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccoidea: Diaspididae) in New Zealand
An up-to-date catalogue of New Zealand's exotic Diaspididae has been developed from studies of curated specimens and the literature. Twenty-eight species are recorded as established by July 2002. Lepidosaphes pallida is recorded in New Zealand for the first time. Five new synonymies are proposed (with the senior synonym in parentheses): Chionaspis candida (= Chionaspis angusta; Mytilaspis eucalypti; Lepidosaphes ulmi var. novozealandica (= Lepidosaphes multipora); Fiorinia grossulariae 1884 (= Lepidosaphes ulmi); and Chionaspis xerotidis (= Pseudaulacaspis eugeniae). For the first time, literature records are shown to be erroneous for a further eight species, which are therefore considered to be not present in New Zealand. They are: Aspidiotus destructor, Ischnaspis longirostris, Lepidosaphes flava, Parlatoria pergandii, Parlatoria ziziphi, Pinnaspis strachani, Pseudaulacaspis pentagona, and Unaspis citri. An annotated list of all 36 species provides for each species a selective synonymy and a summary of some basic biological details, host plant range, geographical distribution, and environmental impact.
