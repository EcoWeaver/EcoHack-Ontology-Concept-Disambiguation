Plant invasions in treeless vegetation of the Australian Alps
A total of 128 invasive plant species have been recorded in treeless vegetation in the Australian Alps. Most of these are forbs and most are uncommon. Cover of invasive species is generally minimal unless there has been gross disturbance to natural vegetation and soils. Although there is a significantly positive correlation between invasive and native species diversity, suggesting that conditions that allow numerous native species to co-exist also permit more plant invasions, altitude is the most important determinant of invasive species diversity. Only 22 of the 128 species have been recorded above 1800 m. Some plant communities (e.g. those with high pH or relatively nutrient-rich soils), however, seem to be vulnerable to invasions regardless of altitude. Most invasive species appear to have been introduced unintentionally (e.g. as seed attached to vehicles, animals and humans) but a few were introduced to assist with revegetation of disturbed soils and for amenity plantings in ski resorts, and have subsequently established in native vegetation. Treeless communities in the Australian Alps are likely to face increasing pressure from invasive species as a result of global warming and continued introduction of non-native plants to ski resort gardens. Whilst it may be difficult to prevent invasive species of low elevations migrating to higher elevations as temperatures rise, the risk of invasion from garden plants could be minimised through regulation. Non-native plants in ski resort gardens pose a far greater risk than most invasive species currently present in the Alps because they have been chosen for their capacity to survive at high altitudes.
