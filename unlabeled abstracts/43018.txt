The role of invasive plant species in drought resilience in agriculture: the case of sweet briar (Rosa rubiginosa L.)
Abstract Sweet briar (Rosa rubiginosa) belongs to the group of wild roses. Under natural conditions it grows throughout Europe, and was introduced also into the southern hemisphere, where it has efficiently adapted to dry lands. This review focuses on the high adaptation potential of sweet briar to soil drought in the context of global climatic changes, especially considering steppe formation and desertification of agricultural, orchard, and horticultural areas. We provide a comprehensive overview of current knowledge on sweet briar traits associated with drought tolerance and particularly water use efficiency, sugar accumulation, accumulation of CO2 in intercellular spaces, stomatal conductance, gibberellin level, effective electron transport between photosystem II and photosystem I, and protein content. We discuss the genetics and potential applications in plant breeding and suggest future directions of study concerning invasive populations of R. rubiginosa. Finally, we point out that sweet briar can provide new genes for breeding in the context of depleting gene pools of the crop plants.
