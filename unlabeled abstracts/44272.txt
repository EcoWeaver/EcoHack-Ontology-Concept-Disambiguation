The effects of primary process of global change on biological invasion in coastal ecosystem
Biological invasion is one of the three most intractable environmental problems. As an important component of global change, biological invasion can be influenced by the other components of global change. As the transitional zone between ocean and land, the coastal ecosystem is the most important buffer which has undergone the impact of sea level rise induced by global change. Furthermore, coastal zone, which has been suffered from frequently and intensively anthropogenic disturbance, is an ecological and environmental sensitive area, and one of the most frequently invaded ecosystems. In this paper, the effects of elevated CO2, sea level rise and eutrophication on the process of biological invasion have been analyzed based on the invasive status of coastal ecosystem. The results indicate that elevated CO2 disturbs the competitive balance between invasive and native species. Sea level rise adjusts the spatial pattern of invasive species and eutrophication of coastal ecosystem promotes further spread of alien species. At last, the research hotspots about interactions between global change and biological invasion in coastal ecosystem are discussed.
