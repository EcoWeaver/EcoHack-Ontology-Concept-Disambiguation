Beyond frontiers: On invasive alien mosquito species in America and Europe
Mosquito vector species (Diptera: Culicidae) are responsible for the transmission ofmany pathogens and parasites to humans and animals. Current predictions indicate that more than halfofthe human population on the planet is at risk ofvector-borne infections. Most ofthe mosquito vectors responsible for transmitting diseases are invasive species. Invasive mosquitoes ofepidemiological importance, such as Aedes aegypti (L.), A. albopictus (Skuse), and Culex quinquefasciatus Say, are more likely to adapt and thrive in urban environ- ments in low-latitude parts ofthe world in comparison with native species. Moreover, invasive species often benefit from biotic homogenization processes and from the reduction in overall biodiversity by being able to increase their range and abundance in the process. The substantial increase in the incidence ofvector-borne diseases can be partially attributed to these factors. In this viewpoint paper, we focus on two highly invasive alien mosquito species: A. albopictus in Europe and C. coronator Dyar and Knab in America, shedding light on key biological, ecological, and epidemiological issues urgently needing further attention at the forefront of vector biology and control research.
