First records of the invasive Amur sleeper, Perccottus glenii Dybowski, 1877 in German freshwaters: a need for realization of effective management measures to stop the invasion
Since 2013, more than 60 specimens of the Amur sleeper, Perccottus glenii Dybowski, 1877 have been captured in four minor watercourses of the Upper Danube, in Bavaria, Germany. Its occurrence in the wild is probably due to unintentional release incidences from nearby enclosed fishponds. An ecological risk assessment showed that this species is a threat to freshwater faunal biodiversity in Germany and has been assigned to the German Action list of invasive alien species. In accordance with nature conservation efforts, effective management policies should urgently be developed and implemented by the appropriate authorities to prevent further dispersal of the Amur sleeper in Germany. The establishment and uncontrolled spread of this invasive alien species in the Upper Danube watercourse and other habitats in Europe can be expected, if preventative measures are not immediately put in place.
