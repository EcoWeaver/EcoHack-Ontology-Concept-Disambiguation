Control of Cortaderia selloana with a glyphosate-based herbicide led to a short-term stimulation of soil fungal communities
In the north of Spain, Cortaderia selloana plants have invaded ecosystems of high ecological value. Control of this species is carried out with the application of glyphosate-based formulations. The aim of this work was to determine, under microcosm conditions, the short-term (2 months) effects of the application of a glyphosate-based herbicide (Roundup(r)) on C. selloana rhizosphere microbial communities. To this purpose, before and after the application of Roundup(r), several parameters that provide information on the biomass, activity and diversity of rhizosphere fungal and bacterial communities (enzyme activities, basal and substrate-induced respiration, potentially mineralizable nitrogen, nitrification potential rate, ergosterol content and community-level profiles with Biolog(tm) plates and ARISA) were determined. We observed a stimulation of some microbial parameters, in particular those related to fungal communities. Further research is needed to determine the long-term consequences of this short-term fungal stimulation for soil functioning.
