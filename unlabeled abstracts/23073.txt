A California grasslands alkali specialist,Hemizonia pungensssp.pungens, prefers non-alkali soil
Question: Edaphically severe habitats commonly support edaphic endemics, specialized plant species that do not occur elsewhere. The endemism of native plant species in edaphically specialized habitats suggests either (a) that these native endemic species are uniquely specialized to survive and grow better under the conditions prevalent in these harsh areas, or (b) that these areas represent refuges from competition with other (often exotic) species. Location: Central Valley, California, USA. Methods: We surveyed the vegetation distribution in alkali sinks and carried out a reciprocal transplant greenhouse experiment crossed with a competition treatment to examine the interplay between interspecific competition and edaphic factors in determining relative performance of an alkali endemic forb (Hemizonia pungens ssp. pungens) and its exotic grass competitor (Lolium multiflorum). Results: Lolium consistently performed better in non-alkali soil. In contrast, Hemizonia, in the absence of competition, performed significantly better on the non-alkali soils, but in competition with Lolium, performed equally well on alkali and non-alkali soils. Conclusions: These results suggest that Hemizonia does not inherently prefer harsh alkali soil, but is better able to tolerate alkali soil and may be excluded from more moderate soils by competition. Therefore, edaphic and biotic effects may interact to determine the spatial distribution of this edaphic endemic. Our data suggest a mechanism by which competition between native and exotic species on impoverished soils leads to dominance of native species and creation of refugia for native species where exotic species are unable to thrive.
