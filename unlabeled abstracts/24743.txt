Overcompensation of seed production caused by clipping of Bidens pilosa var. radiata (Compositae): Implications for weed control on Iriomote-Jima Island, Japan
The invasion of natural ecosystems by exotic species is a major threat to biodiversity on a local, regional, and global scale. Endemic island flora are particularly vulnerable to invasive species. Bidens pilosa var. radiata is a common invasive weed of roadsides, which are subject to clipping, on Japanese subtropical islands. To assess compensation by the weed to damage by clipping, a pot experiment was conducted under common garden conditions. The above-ground parts were clipped with pruning shears at various frequencies, ranging from no clipping (the control) to clipping at 4-16 week intervals for 32 weeks in summer. The clipped individuals regenerated new branches from the axillary buds and flowered for <=12 weeks after the clipping. The regeneration after the clipping gave rise to secondary reproduction, whereas minimal regeneration occurred in the unclipped individuals after the maturation of the fruit. Consequently, the total flower head mass, represented by the dry weight of the inflorescences throughout the experiment, was higher on the individuals that were clipped at 12 and 16 week intervals than on the unclipped individuals, suggesting overcompensation in fecundity. At the higher frequencies of above-ground clipping, the flower head mass was suppressed at 8 week clipping intervals, while both the flower head mass and the productive biomass were suppressed at 4 week clipping intervals. This indicates that clipping at intervals of <=8 weeks is required to prevent the reproduction of this weed.
