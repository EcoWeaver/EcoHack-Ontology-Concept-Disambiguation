Growth parameters of invasive gibel carpCarassius gibelio(Bloch, 1782) in Lake Marmara (Turkey)
AbstractThe objective of this study was to determine growth parameters, such as age-length and length-weight relationships, as well as condition factors and sex ratio, of theCarassius gibelio(Bloch, 1782) population in Lake Marmara (western region of Turkey), which is one of the most important fishing areas. Fish were caught on a monthly basis by gillnets and trammel nets (mesh size 10-50 mm) between March 2012 and February 2013. A total of 1058 specimens (809 females and 249 males) were examined. The female-male ratio was 1:0.31. The maximum age was determined as VI and V for females and males, respectively. The total length of females and males ranged from 10.0 to 27.5 cm and from 10.2 to 24.0 cm, respectively. Their weight varied from 17.1 to 378.4 g and from 17.7 to 244.9 g, respectively. Length-weight relationship parameters werea= 0.014 andb= 3.040 for females anda= 0.015 andb= 3.039 for males. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters of theC. gibeliopopulation were as follows: L= 35.86 cm, k = 0.189 year-1, t0= -1.238 years. Minimum and maximum condition factors were 1.56 for females in October and 1.82 in May and 1.67 for males in September and 1.94 in January.
