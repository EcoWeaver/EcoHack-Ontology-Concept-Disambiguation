Modelling cost-effective clearing solutions for invasive alien trees: A case study on wilding conifers
Accurate on-site identification of appropriate alien clearing methods can realize significant cost savings for heterogenous sites. We developed a cost-based model accounting for site parameters such as infestation density, slope, obstructive vegetation density and site-access. These parameters are combined with a unit-costing sub-module to identify the most cost-effective clearing method for a particular site. The model was tested in the heterogenous Cape Fynbos biome of South Africa for three clearing methods for Pinus: traditional felling, drill-and-fill, and the arial-basal bark application (ABBA) method. The model accounts for the above-mentioned site parameters after which it is calibrated with the unit-costing for each method. Various scenarios consisting of different combinations of above-mentioned site parameters are then applied to identify the cost-effective solution for any particular combination of site parameters. Results favoured the drill-and-fill method in most cases, with the ABBA method reserved for sites with isolated Pines situated in dense fynbos with difficult access at slope gradients of 45deg and higher. At these site combinations, ground teams experience longer walk times which reduces their productivity to such an extent that ABBA is comparatively more cost-effective. Traditional felling turned out to be prohibitively expensive because of team composition (mandatory higher safety and supervision requirements required for chainsaw operations) and slower on-site walking due to heavier equipment. The information enables site managers to do more accurate planning since the model will ensure that a cost-effective method is chosen for any particular site. It is then up to the manager to implement the chosen clearing method in a cost-efficient way.
