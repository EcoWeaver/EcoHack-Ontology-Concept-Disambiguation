Eleven microsatellite loci for two invasive freshwater apple snails, Pomacea canaliculata and P. maculata (Ampullariidae)
Pomacea canaliculata and P. maculata are major invasive species that continue to spread and negatively impact aquatic habitats globally. Herein we report the development of a set of highly polymorphic microsatellite loci that readily amplify in both species, and that will be informative for understanding the pathways of spread and population structure across the native and non-native range. The high polymorphism of these markers should also provide substantial power for refining the estimated origins of the introduced populations. However, they are uninformative for assessing introgressive hybridization between the two species because of shared alleles.
