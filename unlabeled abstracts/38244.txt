Can introduced species replace lost biodiversity? A test with freshwater molluscs
Human activity has dramatically accelerated both species extinctions and introductions, and the balance of these two processes is generally expected to reduce biodiversity and increase taxonomic homogenization. However, few tests of this hypothesis have been made. We tested whether new macroinvertebrate invaders in North American freshwaters can replace the recent loss of biodiversity, particularly focusing on molluscs. We found that both crustaceans and molluscs are overrepresented among endangered and recently extinct species, as well as among invaders. For molluscs, the number of recently extinct species (79 species) was more than twice that for exotic species (38 species). In addition, molluscan invaders are from different taxonomic families than recently extinct or endangered species. While most extinct and endangered molluscs are from streams and rivers, invaders preferentially colonize lakes and reservoirs. The impact of humans on species introductions and extinctions increases with spatial scale (from local to continental scales), resulting in the increased phylogenetic dissimilarity between introduced species and native communities. Construction of dams and alteration of the flow regimes of lotic systems will continue to lead to the extinction of native species, and promote the spread of invaders, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and taxonomic homogenization.
