Status of the rose-ringed parakeet Psittacula krameri in Lisbon, Portugal
Of all alien parrots, the rose-ringed parakeet Psittacula krameri is the most successful invasive species, with established populations in at least 35 countries. This paper reports a study, conducted from March to August 2015, on the population size in Lisbon (Portugal) using roost counts. We found only one important roost for this parrot in Campo Grande, where a maximum of 644 individuals were counted in July. The recorded information suggests that this species has increased considerably since the last counts done. The present status of this species in the city may lead to a further expansion into new nearby areas.
