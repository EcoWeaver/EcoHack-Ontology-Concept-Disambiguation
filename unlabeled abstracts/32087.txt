Experimental effects of white-tailed deer and an invasive shrub on forest ant communities
Ungulate browse and invasive plants exert pressure on plant communities and alter the physical and chemical properties of soils, but little is known about their effects on litter-dwelling arthropods. In particular, ants (Formicidae) are ubiquitous in temperate forests and are sensitive to changes in habitat structure and resources. As ants play many functional roles, changes to ant communities may lead to changes in ecosystem processes. We conducted a long-term experiment that controlled white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) access and presence of an invasive understory shrub in deciduous forests located in southwestern Ohio, USA from 2011 to 2017. Several leaf-litter ant community responses and litter biomass were measured in five paired deer access and exclosure plots, each with a split-plot removal of Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Ant abundance and species richness increased with time in deer exclosures, but not in deer access plots. Honeysuckle removal reduced abundance and richness of ants. There were additive effects of deer and honeysuckle on ant richness, and interactive effects of deer and honeysuckle on ant abundance. Deer exclusion reduced variation in ant composition relative to access plots. There was little evidence that treatments directly influenced species diversity of ants. However, all ant measures were positively related to litter biomass, which was greater in deer exclosures relative to access plots. Our results indicate strong indirect effects of herbivores and honeysuckle on litter-dwelling ants, mediated through changes in litter biomass and likely vegetation structure, which may alter ant-mediated ecosystem processes.
