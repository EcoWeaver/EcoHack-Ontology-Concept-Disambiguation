Invasive Neobiota im Wald: Konzepte und wissenschaftliche Grundlagen
Invasive non-native species in forests: key concepts and scientific foundations The article summarizes key concepts and the scientific foundations regarding invasive non-native species and their management, with a focus on forestry. In particular, the three management phases 1) prevention, 2) early detection and containment, and 3) control and long-term management of established species are discussed. In Switzerland, over 100 non-native species are considered invasive by experts; many of them occur in forests. Given the complexity of the challenge, successful management in general needs to be adapted to specific contexts such as the forestry sector, and should involve directly affected decision-makers and experts. Dealing with invasive species is therefore a permanent task of the forestry sector as a whole, which can not be delegated to just one institution or administrative level (cantonal, national or international).
