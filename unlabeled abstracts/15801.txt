The problem of assessing the viability of invasive species in the conditions of the steppe zone of Ukraine
This article proposes a completely new method of resolving the pressing global environmental problem of assessing the capacity of invasive organisms to adapt to new environmental conditions. A new three-step approach to the evaluation of vital and ecological functions of invasive species is recommended. In addition to classic species and population surveys, it was proposed to apply a stress-resistance biochemical assessment of invasive species. Stress resistance can be regarded as the main response of living organisms to changes in continuous environmental components. The obtained results will provide an opportunity to give a qualitative prognisis of what adaptive capacity an invasive species has,what precise ecological functions and for what time period it can perform in a new ecosystem.
