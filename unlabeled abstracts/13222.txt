Tracking invasive animals with electronic tags to assess risks and develop management strategies
Invasive species alter ecosystem structure and function when they establish in new habitats. Although preventing or managing invasions is extremely important for maintaining biodiversity, doing so is difficult and requires efficient intervention. Remote monitoring of free-living animals with electronic tags (i.e. tags that transmit data remotely or log them for future retrieval) can contribute important knowledge about invasive animal biology. A quantitative literature review identified instances in which electronic tagging has contributed to studying invasions. Electronic tags were generally used for one of four purposes: (1) characterize spatial ecology; (2) identify interactions; (3) assess risk potential; or (4) evaluate management options. Overall, electronic tags have considerable potential for developing, refining, and evaluating invasion management strategies that contribute to conservation efforts. We explore the role of electronic tags as a component of integrated control program design and implementation for invasive animals.
