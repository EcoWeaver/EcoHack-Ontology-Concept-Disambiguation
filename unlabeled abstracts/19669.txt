What pollinatesLantana camarain the mountains of Costa Rica?
Lantana camaraL. (Verbenaceae) is a shrub of Neotropical origin that has spread to at least 60 countries (Dayet al. 2003), and its ability to rapidly occupy disturbed habitat has led to it being named one of the ten worst weeds on the planet (Cronk & Fuller 1995, Sharmaet al. 2005). A number of traits may have contributed to its success as an invasive species. For example,L. camaraincreases the available soil nitrogen in otherwise nitrogen-poor ecosystems (Sharma & Raghubanshi 2009), it is extremely resilient to disturbance (Gentle & Guggin 1997a, Hiremath & Sundram 2005), it is allelopathic to native plants (Achhireddy & Singh 1984, Gentle & Duggin 1997b) and its fruits are dispersed by a variety of birds (Mandon-Dalgeret al. 2004, Swarbricket al. 1998). A potentially unappreciated aspect ofL. camarabiology that may also contribute to its invasiveness relates to pollination ecology.
