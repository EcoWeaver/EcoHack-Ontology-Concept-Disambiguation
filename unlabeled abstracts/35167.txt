A new invasive species of buprestid beetles in the Russian fauna: Lamprodila (Palmar) festiva (L.) (Coleoptera, Buprestidae), a pest of Cupressaceae
The buprestid beetle Lamprodila (Palmar) festiva (L.) (Coleoptera, Buprestidae, Poecilonoini), an invasive pest of cultivated Cupressaceae such as Thuja, Chamaecyparis, Cupressus, and Juniperus in the Greater Sochi area (the Russian Black Sea coast), is recorded for the first time for Russia and the former USSR. Data on the systematic position, diagnostic characters, distribution, host plants, biology of the new pest, and its damage to urban plantations are discussed. Recent records of this species in the new areas of Central and Eastern Europe as well as on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus suggest expansion of its range during the recent decades.
