The effect of invasive plant management on the rate of removal of vertebrate-dispersed fruits
Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata is an invasive plant in eastern Australia. It produces large quantities of fleshy fruits, which are dispersed by birds and mammals, and has the potential to alter ecological processes in native plant communities in several ways. Seed dispersal of native plants growing amongst C. monilifera could be decreased (if C. monilifera is effective in competing for limited seed dispersers), increased (if C. monilifera-infested vegetation supports more seed dispersers), or be unchanged (if there is sufficient separation in fruiting time or dispersal agents between the species, or if dispersers are not limiting). We compared the rates of removal of fruits of native plants (Monotoca elliptica and Elaeocarpus spp.) from experimental stations in C. monilifera stands, in uninfested coastal vegetation, and in vegetation from which C. monilifera had been eliminated with herbicide. The rate of removal of fruits differed between plant species and locations, but not between any of the habitat treatments. This may have resulted from temporal separation of peak fruit availability between M. elliptica and C. monilifera, and differences in fruit morphology and disperser assemblages between Elaeocarpus spp. and C. monilifera. We also measured removal of C. monilifera fruits from stations in C. monilifera stands and from where C. monilifera had been eliminated with herbicide. In the herbicide-treated habitat, removal of C. monilifera fruits was reduced. This may assist control efforts and suggests that, to reduce seed dispersal, dense (core) populations should be targeted in control programs.
