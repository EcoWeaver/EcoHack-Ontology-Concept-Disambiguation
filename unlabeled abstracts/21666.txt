First record of the common carp Cyprinus carpio var. communis (Linnaeus, 1758) and the mirror carp Cyprinus carpio var. specularis (Lacepede, 1803) in Tabasco, Southern Gulf of Mexico
Cyprinus carpio is known to be established in most of Mexico. Only the Mexican Gulf states were free of this species until recently. This paper reports the first record of the common carp in Tabasco, Mexico. Seven specimens of Cyprinus carpio var. communis and one specimen of Cyprinus carpio var. specularis were detected in a small scale fishing landing site near Frontera, Tabasco on January 24, 2011. Further sampling and monitoring is required to assess the ecological impacts of this exotic species on the native fauna.
