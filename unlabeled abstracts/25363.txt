Risk assessment model for dispersion of ballast water organisms in shelf seas
The recommendation of mid-ocean exchange of ballast water has resulted in significant release of aquatic invasive species in shelf areas. This paper describes a semiquantitative risk assessment model developed for dispersion of ballast water organisms in shelf seas. The model simulates ballast water exchange as the release of tracer into the surface layer of a circulation model of the Scotian Shelf and Gulf of Maine. Three metrics are proposed to describe the risk of invasion: (i) the time-integrated concentration at a given location (the cumulative exposure index); (ii) the time taken for organisms to reach a given area (the invasion time); and (iii) the onshelf average concentration. A risk equation is derived that computes the relative overall risk of invasion for exchange segments along vessel tracks. Model results confirm the choice of offshelf alternate ballast water exchange zone advised by Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada. Low risk segments tend to be adjacent to one another. A four- to eight-fold reduction in invasion risk is possible, although this is likely a lower bound because of the use of monthly mean velocity fields. The model can be run in an operational mode to provide real-time risk assessment for vessel ballast water exchange.
