Hydrological Characteristics of Cienfuegos Bay, Cuba, Related to the Presence of the Invasive Green Mussel Perna viridis
The aim of this work was to analyze hydrological condition variations in Cienfuegos' Bay in 2011 and its possible influence in life cycle and distribution of the green mussel Perna viridis. The hydrological parameters in the bay are described according to the campaigns performed in February, May and November. Samples from two levels (surface and bottom) were taken, in order to get water temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen. The results show the climatic seasonality influence (dry and rain) both in spatial as well as in vertical distribution of the observed parameters. The mean concentrations of the analyzed hydrological markers were in agreement with the NC 25: 1999 requirements of good quality water for fishing use. The observed hydrological variability allows the growth and developement of the green mussel in Cienfuegos Bay waters.
