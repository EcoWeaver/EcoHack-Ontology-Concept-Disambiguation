When exotic introductions fail: updating invasion beliefs
Decisions regarding invasive risk of exotic species are often based on species distribution models projected onto the recipient region of interest. Such projections are essentially a measure of prior belief in the ability of an organism to invade. Whilst many decisions are made on the basis of such projections, it is less clear how such prior belief may be empirically modified on the basis of data, in particular introduction events that haven't led to establishment. Here, using the Asian green mussel (Perna viridis) as an example, we illustrate how information on failed introduction attempts may be used to continually update our beliefs in the ability of an organism to invade per introduction, and the underlying habitat suitability for establishment. Our results show that the establishment probability of P. viridis per fouled ship visit in the supposedly favourable northern Australian waters are much lower than initially though, and are continuing to decline. A Bayesian interpretation of our results notes the dramatic reduction in our belief of the ability of P. viridis to invade in the light of what we estimate to be 100's of fouled vessels per year visiting ports without any persistent populations establishing. Under a hypothetico-deductive approach we would reject the null (prior) species distribution model as being useful, and seek to find a better one that can withstand the challenge of data.
