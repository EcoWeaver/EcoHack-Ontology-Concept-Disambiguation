Four alien species of Red Sea Cardinal fishes have been reported to date from the eastern Mediterranean, three of them discovered during the last five years. Here we report the finding of a fifth alien cardinal fish Cheilodipterus novemstriatus (Ruppell, 1838) in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The fish was collected from the wreck of an old sunken ship off the Tel Aviv coast.
