Should we care about purple loosestrife? The history of an invasive plant in North America
Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L., Lythraceae) is considered one of the worst invasive plant species in the world. In this paper, I reconstruct how purple loosestrife quickly became, after a long (150years) period of indifference, the persona non grata of North American wetlands. I then compare the portrayal of the species in newspapers (907 articles) to that supported by the scientific literature (38 peer-review papers). The depiction of purple loosestrife in scientific studies (lacking definition) is far removed from that in newspapers (alarming). Some native species likely suffer from an invasion, but stating that this plant has large negative impacts on wetlands is probably exaggerated. If purple loosestrife is not a primary cause of extinction or a major contributor to the decline of other species, but is instead an indicator of anthropogenic disturbances, the resources and efforts devoted to removing this species might be better focused on more effective means to protect wetlands against disturbances.
