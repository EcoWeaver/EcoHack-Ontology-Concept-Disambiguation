Tachinid flies (Diptera: Tachinidae), pollinators of aboriginal and alien species of the umbel plants (Apiaceae) in Moscow Region (Russia)
Abstract. The role of tachinid flies (Diptera: Tachinidae) as pollinators of aboriginal and alien species of the umbel plants (Apiaceae) in Moscow Region (Russia) is discussed. From total number of 34 tachinid flies, 11 species were observed on aboriginal plants only. Five species, Myxexoristops blondeli (Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830), Pachystylum bremii Macquart, 1848, Neaera laticornis (Meigen, 1824), Actia pilipennis (Fallen, 1810) and Eriothrix rufomaculatus (De Geer, 1776) were collected on Heracleum sosnowskyi exclusively, and two species, Medina collaris (Fallen, 1820) and Policheta unicolor (Fallen, 1820), on Pastinaca sativa only. More than half of examined tachinids (23 species) demonstrated selectivity to the host plant, each of them pollinated one plant species. Eleven tachinid species pollinated more than 1 plant species. The least selectivity to plant species was stated for tachinids Solieria pacifica (Meigen, 1824) and Strongygaster globula (Meigen, 1824), registered on 5 Apiaceae species as well as on plants from other families.
