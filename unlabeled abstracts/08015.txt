Demographic compensation does not rescue populations at a trailing range edge
Significance While climate change is causing poleward shifts in many species' geographic distributions, some species' ranges have remained stable, particularly at low-latitude limits. One explanation for why some species' ranges have not shifted is demographic compensation across a species' range, whereby declines in demographic processes like survival or reproduction are offset by increases in others, potentially buffering populations from extinction. However, we have limited understanding of whether demographic compensation can prevent collapse of populations facing climate change. We examined the demography of natural populations of a perennial herb spanning a broad latitudinal gradient. Despite increases in reproduction, low-latitude populations declined due to diminished survival, growth, and recruitment. Thus, demographic compensation may not be sufficient to rescue low-latitude, trailing-edge populations from extinction.
