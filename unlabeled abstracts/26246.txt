Ecology of the invasive Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774) in aquatic ecosystems: an overview
The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea is one of the most invasive species in freshwater aquatic ecosystems. The rapid growth, earlier sexual maturity, short life span, high fecundity and its association with human activities makes C. fluminea a non-indigenous invasive species likely to colonize new environments. This species, originally distributed in Asiatic ecosystems, is now a common inhabitant of American and European freshwater habitats. The present paper reviews the information related to the life cycle, ecology and potential ecological and economic impacts caused by C. fluminea in the invaded habitats. Furthermore, this paper also proposed future works that may be implemented in order to increase our general knowledge about the ecology of this bivalve.
