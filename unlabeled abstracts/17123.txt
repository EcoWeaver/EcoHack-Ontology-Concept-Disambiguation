Schizophyllum commune: a case study for testing the potential introduction of non-native strains into New Zealand
The behaviour and risk associated with wood-inhabiting saprobic fungi introduced through trade is poorly understood. We used the cosmopolitan species Schizophyllum commune, considered a biosecurity risk in New Zealand, as a case study to test the potential for naturalization of alien strains/populations of wood-inhabiting saprobic fungi to occur. Phylogenetic analysis of the intergenic spacer 1 region was undertaken to determine the origin of New Zealand samples and one Cook Islands sample from the three known globally geographically distinct clades: North/Central America (NAM); South America (SAM); European/Asia/Australia (EAS). All New Zealand S. commune sequences fall within the EAS clade in two distinct groups with four haplotypes (Ia, Ib, IIb and IIa), with no evidence of naturalization of individuals from the NAM and SAM clades. The diversity of the haplotypes can be explained by two natural dispersal events in pre-human times. Ensuring timber is sufficiently treated will prevent alien populations possibly outcompeting native populations.
