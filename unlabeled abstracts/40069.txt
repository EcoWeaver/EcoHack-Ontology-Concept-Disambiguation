Seedling Mortality in Mimosa Pigra, an Invasive Tropical Shrub
(1) The factors controlling seedling survival of the introduced shrub Mimosa pigra were investigated in a dense thicket on the sloping bank of a lagoon in tropical northern Australia. (2) Most germination occurred at the start of the dry season, from seeds falling from the canopy on to moist bare soil exposed as the flood waters retreated. The earliest cohort emerged at the top of the slope, and the last cohort at the bottom. (3) The death rate during the ensuing dry season was lowest in the earliest cohort--furthest from the water's edge--and greatest in the cohort in the middle of the slope. No seedlings survived the flooding of the following wet season. (4) Survival was density-independent, except at the first sampling date, about two weeks after emergence. (5) Removal of the canopy had no significant effect on the probability of seedling survival, while artificial shade enhanced survival, as did irrigation. (6) Seedling survival was determined by the availability of soil moisture. The massive expansion in the Australian range of M. pigra that occurred in the late 1970s can probably be attributed to prolific seed production, coupled with episodic recruitment resulting from unusual rainfall patterns.
