A review of the effects ofBythotrephes longimanusand calcium decline on zooplankton communities -- can interactive effects be predicted?
Anthropogenic stressors including acid deposition, invasive species, and calcium (Ca) decline have produced widespread damage to Canadian Shield lakes, especially to their zooplankton communities. Here, we review current knowledge on the individual effects on zooplankton by the non-indigenous predator Bythotrephes longimanus and Ca decline; we identify knowledge gaps in this literature and examine the likely interactive impacts of Bythotrephes invasions and Ca decline on zooplankton. The negative impacts of Bythotrephes longimanus on zooplankton communities are well known, whereas current understanding of the effects of declining Ca on zooplankton is restricted to Daphnia spp.; hence, there is a large knowledge gap on how declining Ca may affect zooplankton communities in general. The co-occurring impacts of Bythotrephes and declining Ca have rarely been studied at the species level, and we expect daphniids, particularly Daphnia retrocurva and Daphnia pulicaria, to be the most sensitive to both stressors. We also expect a synergistic negative interaction on cladocerans in lakes with both stressors, leaving a community dominated by Holopedium glacialis and (or) copepods. Our predictions form testable hypotheses but since species and ecosystem response to multiple stressors are difficult to predict, we may actually see ecological surprises in Canadian Shield lakes as Bythotrephes continues to spread and Ca levels continue to fall.
