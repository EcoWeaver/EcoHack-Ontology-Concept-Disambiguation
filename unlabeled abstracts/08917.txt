The biodiversity benefits of botanic gardens.
It has been suggested that Botanic Gardens had in the past, and continue to have today, an important role in plant invasions across the globe. Although mistakes were made in the past, it is contended that such historical actions need to be viewed in the context of the time, and the situation is different today. Although most plant introductions have had a positive effect, some have shown invasive potential in certain regions. Because of their educational mission and scientific expertise, botanic gardens today are taking an active role in combating invasives. The combined collections of botanic gardens comprise 1/3rd of all known plant species and have considerable conservation value. According to the IUCN, the number of extinct plant species would be 34% higher were it not for those preserved in gardens. There are sometimes good reasons to include a regional invasive in a garden's collection. There is clearly no room for complacency, but Botanic Gardens today are developing new approaches to their collections and are key to mitigating the effects of invasive species in the future.
