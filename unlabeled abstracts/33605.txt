Introduced Species of Mole Crickets in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae)
Seven species of mole crickets have been introduced accidentally into the United States (including Hawaii), Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Five species have been introduced into the United States: Gryllotalpa africana Palisot de Beauvois, G. gryllotalpa L., Scapteriscus abbreviatus Scudder (also introduced into Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands), S. acletus Rehn and Hebard, and S. vicinus Scudder. Two other species have been introduced into Puerto Rico: S. didactylus (Latreille) and S. imitatus Nickle and Castner, a new species described herein. These species have been implicated as pests of agricultural crops, turf, and pasture grass. Finding the homelands of these species is an important first step in locating potential natural enemies that may ultimately resolve the problems associated with mole crickets.
