Comparisons between two Antarctic nematodes: cultured Panagrolaimus sp. DAW1 and field-sourced Panagrolaimus davidi
The Antarctic nematodePanagrolaimus davidican survive intracellular freezing. Genetic studies indicate the culture strain (now designated asPanagrolaimussp. DAW1) is a different species to theP. davidiof field origin. This paper reports further attempts both to isolate DAW1 from Antarctic soils and to cultureP. davidiitself. Sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene of 151 individuals indicates that DAW1 is rare in the field, but characterising two new isolates shows that, nevertheless, it is present.Panagrolaimus davidiis common in the field, but cannot be cultured using the media tested here. These two species are difficult to distinguish morphologically, apart from the absence of males in DAW1 and its longer recurved tail. Whilst it is possible that DAW1 is an introduced species, the sites at Shackleton's hut at Cape Royds are dominated byP. davidi, which is clearly an endemic species.
