Global occurrence data improve potential distribution models for Aedes japonicus japonicus in non-native regions
Background: There is great interest in modelling the distribution of invasive species, in particular from the point of view of management. However, distribution modelling for invasive species using ecological niche models (ENMs) involves multiple challenges. Due to the short time span since the introduction or arrival of a non-indigenous species and the associated dispersal limitations, applying regular ENMs at an early stage of the invasion process may result in an underestimation of the potential niche in the new ranges. This topic will be dealt with here using the example of Aedes japonicus japonicus, a vector competent mosquito species for a number of diseases. Results: We found a high niche unfilling for the species' non-native range niches in Europe and North America compared to the native range niche, which can be explained by the early stage of the invasion process. Comparing four different ENMs based on a) the European - and b) the North American non-native range occurrence data, c) (derived) native range occurrence data and d) all available occurrence data together we found large differences in the projected climatic suitability, with the global data model projecting larger areas with projected climatic suitability. Conclusion: ENM in biological invasions can be challenging, especially when distribution data is only poor available. We suggest one possible way to project climatic suitability for Aedes j. japonicus despite poor data availability for the non-native ranges and missing occurrences from the native range. We discuss aspects of the lack of information and the associated implications for modelling. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
