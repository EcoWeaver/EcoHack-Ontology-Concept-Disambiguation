The role of diatom resting stages in the onset of the spring bloom in the East China Sea
The abundance and species composition of diatoms were investigated along the PN line from the Okinawa Islands to the inner continental shelf in the East China Sea in the early spring of 1996. Viable diatom resting stages in sediments on the shelf were also enumerated by the extinction dilution method (most probable number method). Clear differentiation in the water masses was observed, with less saline, cold water (shelf water) on the shelf region, and warm, saline water (Kuroshio water) prevalent off the shelf and on the shelf edge. In the Kuroshio water, the abundance of diatoms was generally low but species diversity of diatoms was relatively high. In contrast, the spring bloom of diatoms was clearly observed in the shelf water where the water column was weakly stratified. The bloom was dominated by Chaetoceros debilis, contributing occasionally >80% of the diatom community. Resting stages of this species were also the most abundant taxon in the sediments on the shelf. Resuspension of the sediment during winter mixing of the water column should have enabled the resting stages to germinate at the surface. Subsequent vegetative growth after germination led to the formation of an early spring bloom of C. debilis when the water column was stratified and light availability had increased. Intermittent resuspension of sediment on the shelf, driven by strong winds and tidal currents, probably provides opportunities for diatoms with a resting stage to exploit favorable conditions for their germination and subsequent vegetative growth. It is further suggested that complex hydrographic conditions in the East China Sea result in a dynamic bloom with contributions by both autochthonous and allochthonous species.
