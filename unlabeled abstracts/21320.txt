The Vascular Flora of the Indian Mountain Forever Wild Tract, Cherokee County, Alabama
The Indian Mountain Forever Wild Tract (IMFWT) is a 240-ha property that was acquired in two purchases by the State of Alabama Forever Wild Program on 18 September 1997 and 31 December 2001. The IMFWT lies 55 km east of Gadsden, AL, and is in the Terrapin Creek watershed, a tributary of the Coosa River. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources manages the site with an emphasis on recreational use and habitat management. An intensive floristic study of this area was conducted from March 2007 through May 2008. A total of 431 taxa (430 species) from 281 genera and 103 families were collected, with 157 taxa being county records. Asteraceae was the most-collected family, with 73 species. Poaceae, Fabaceae, and Cyperaceae were the families with the next highest numbers of taxa found (40, 28, and 17 species, respectively). Quercus was the most-represented genus, with 11 taxa. Fifty non-native species were collected during the surveys. Plant collections were deposited at the Anniston Museum of Natural History Herbarium, with duplicates deposited at the University of Alabama Herbarium (UNA), Auburn University Herbarium (AUA), and Troy University Herbarium (TROY).
