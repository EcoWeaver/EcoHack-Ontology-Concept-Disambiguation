Invasive or not? The case of Grateloupia turuturu (Rhodophyta, Halymeniales) in the Northern Ionian Sea (Mediterranean Sea)
It has been predicted that Grateloupia turuturu, native of the cold-temperate waters of Japan, is one of the most invasive marine species considered as a threat to global marine biodiversity. However, few studies have been carried out to assess the extent of its spread worldwide. Its seasonal dynamics in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto, a transitional water system in the Northern Ionian Sea, were observed for ten years. Systematic monthly observations were carried out from 2008 to 2018. The length of thalli and density were measured alongside the seawater temperature. Data were processed by means of non-parametric statistical analyses. No invasive behavior was detected for G. turuturu. It seems well established in the Mar Piccolo even though its population is limited to the station of first detection. However, due to its shown preference for plastic substrate, it could become a vector of another urgent threat, that is plastic pollution.
