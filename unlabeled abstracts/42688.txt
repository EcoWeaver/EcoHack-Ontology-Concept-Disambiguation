PLANNING AND USE OF AREAS INFESTED WITH INVASIVE PLANTS: CASE OF LATVIA
Sustainable development of the national economy is based on the reasonable use of natural resources. Increase area of uncultivated agriculture land is one of the risk factors of land degradation in Latvia. Land degradation prevention measures, including restriction of invasive plant species, are carried out to fulfill overall interests of the society. In conditions of globalization, previously unknown plants purposely or accidentally propagate into Latvian environment, and their proportion is increasing. Many of these species are growing, multiplying and spreading rapidly in our climate, displacing native species, causing significant biological pollution and becoming dominant. Such aggressive species are called invasive. They have become a serious problem in natural ecosystems, creating problems for the protection of native plant species, preserving the visual value of traditional landscapes, and causing significant economic damage to the economy. The aim of research is to analyse indicators characterizing abandoned economic activity territory - spread of invasive plants, their limitation and elimination. Restoring brownfields can improve land use and quality of landscape.
