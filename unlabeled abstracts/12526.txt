Reimagining South American coasts: unveiling the hidden invasion history of an iconic ecological engineer
The smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora is an iconic ecological engineer that has inspired some of the more insightful concepts and perspectives in modern theoretical ecology and environmental management, from population to community and ecosystem scales. Although it is currently considered native over more than 100 degrees of latitude along the Atlantic coast of the Americas, we challenge the default assumption that this cordgrass is native to South America, and propose an alternative hypothesis that it was introduced in the 18th or early 19th century by human activity.
