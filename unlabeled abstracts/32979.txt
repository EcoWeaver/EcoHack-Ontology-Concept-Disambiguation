The N-fixing legume Periandra mediterranea constrains the invasion of an exotic grass (Melinis minutiflora P. Beauv) by altering soil N cycling
Melinis minutiflora is an invasive species that threatens the biodiversity of the endemic vegetation of the campo rupestre biome in Brazil, displacing the native vegetation and favouring fire spread. As M. minutiflora invasion has been associated with a high nitrogen (N) demand, we assessed changes in N cycle under four treatments: two treatments with contrasting invasion levels (above and below 50%) and two un-invaded control treatments with native vegetation, in the presence or absence of the leguminous species Periandra mediterranea. This latter species was considered to be the main N source in this site due to its ability to fix N2 in association with Bradyrhizobia species. Soil proteolytic activity was high in treatments with P. mediterranea and in those severely invaded, but not in the first steps of invasion. While ammonium was the N-chemical species dominant in plots with native species, including P.mediterranea, soil nitrate prevailed only in fully invaded plots due to the stimulation of the nitrifying bacterial (AOB) and archaeal (AOA) populations carrying the amoA gene. However, in the presence of P. mediterranea, either in the beginning of the invasion or in uninvaded plots, we observed an inhibition of the nitrifying microbial populations and nitrate formation, suggesting that this is a biotic resistance strategy elicited by P. mediterranea to compete with M. minutiflora. Therefore, the inhibition of proteolytic activity and the nitrification process were the strategies elicited by P.mediterranea to constrain M.munitiflora invasion.
