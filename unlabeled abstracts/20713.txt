A successful model from Hawaii for rapid response to invasive species
We outline a functional management model for the eradication of incipient populations of invasive species that avoids reliance on official governmental response. This model involves formation of informal multi-partner committees that utilise outside funding to achieve pest-management goals. We describe why such a system was needed in Hawaii, how it is structured, how it operates, its achievements, and its advantages and limitations. Fragmented and incomplete governmental authorities are currently the rule for invasive-species management in many parts of the world and typically lead to non-response or an ineffective response. The model we describe serves the useful function of allowing eradication of incipient pests to proceed while comprehensive biosecurity programs are devised through more traditional governmental channels.
