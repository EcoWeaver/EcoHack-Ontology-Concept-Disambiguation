Species invasion progressively disrupts the trophic structure of native food webs
Significance Invasive species are a leading cause of biodiversity loss, yet the mechanisms by which invaders progressively disrupt ecosystems and native species remain unclear. Using an extensive isotope dataset across multiple ecosystems and stages of invasion, we show that an invasive fish predator (lake trout) disrupted food webs by forcing native fishes to feed on suboptimal food sources in different habitats, resulting in the functional extirpation of the native predator, threatened bull trout. Our results provide insights into the magnitude, direction, and timing of food web disruption from invasive species and will be important for predicting ecosystem consequences of species invasions.
