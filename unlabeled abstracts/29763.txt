Ecological characteristics of the invasive Asian date mussel,Musculista senhousia, in the Sacca Di Goro (Adriatic Sea, Italy)
A population of the invasive musselMusculista senhousia was monitored bimonthly from May 1999 through April 2000 in the Sacca di Goro, a brackish lagoon of the Po River Delta, Northern Adriatic Sea, in order to give information on the gametogenic cycle, population dynamics, and secondary production of this successful invader. The gonad underwent 4 different stages: spent (December to February), developing (March to May), ripe (June to August), and spawning (September to November). The population was numerically dominated by a single cohort of individuals for most of the year. The mean size of this cohort rapidly increased to 24-25 mm shell length, after which growth slowed and mussels rarely grew larger than 30-32 mm. Summer anoxia may have greatly reduced mussel abundance; annual cohort mortality was 95%. No recruitment was registered on the bed until February 2000, and there was a large pulse of new recruits in April when two cohorts were clearly recognizable. The established bed was the primary site for new recruitment. Secondary production, calculated with two different methods, gave comparable estimates; P:B ratios were 1.5 and 1.7.M. senhousia beds seemed to facilitate the presence of other macrofaunal taxa: abundance of some species (a small gastropod, amphipods, and tube-building polychaetes) were significantly higher within mussel mats at two sites sampled in May 2000 than they were in soft-sediments ~100 m away.
