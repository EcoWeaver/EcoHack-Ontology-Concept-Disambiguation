Geographic expansion of the invasive red crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852) (Crustacea: Decapoda) in Mexico
The red crayfish Procambarus clarkii, which is native to southcentral USA and northeastern Mexico, has been successfully introduced into several countries around the world. This study documents the geographic expansion of the exotic red crayfish in Mexico and discusses the consequence of a greater propagation of this species in Mexican inland waters. New state records of this crayfish in the Baja California peninsula and in the states of Durango and Sinaloa indicate its progressive dispersion. The propagation of P.clarkii in Mexico has been caused mainly by human introduction, but it is also facilitated because of the species' tolerance to an ample range of environmental conditions. Because of the invasive capability of P.clarkii, we suspect that this exotic species is competing for habitat and food with native freshwater shrimp of the genus Macrobrachium in many sites of northern Mexico.
