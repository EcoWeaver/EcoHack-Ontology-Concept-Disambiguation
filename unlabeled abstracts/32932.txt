Trophic responses to aquatic pollution of native and exotic livebearer fishes
The objective of this study was to evaluate if aquatic pollution promote diet shifts in two livebearer fishes (Poeciliidae): an exotic species, the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), and a native livebearer (Phalloceros uai). The study was carried out in a Brazilian basin highly impacted by anthropogenic activities, especially discharge of domestic and industrial sewage from a region with more than five million human inhabitants. To evaluate the trophic ecology of both native and exotic species it was analysed carbon (d13C) and nitrogen (d15N) stable isotopes of fish tissue, food resources and, sewage. Moreover, stable isotopes analyses were coupled with gut contents of the two species to provide additional information about fish diet. Exotic guppy abundance was high in the most polluted site, where P. reticulata assimilated carbon directly from sewage. The native species was absent in the most polluted site, but presented wider niches than the exotic species in almost all other sites. Gut content analyses indicated high consumption of aquatic insects by both species. However, while the native species consumed a diverse suite of insect taxa, the exotic species consumed mainly Chironomidae larvae. We conclude that aquatic pollution promotes diet shifts in both native and exotic species, with both species changing their trophic niches in a similar way according to the level of degradation of the environment. The ability to directly assimilate sewage, together with its capacity to survive in environments with poor water quality and its reproductive strategy, may favour the establishment of exotic guppies in strongly polluted sites.
