Isolation and characterisation of 11 tetranucleotide microsatellite loci in the common genet (Genetta genetta)
We report the isolation and characterization of 11 polymorphic tetranucleotide microsatellite loci in the common genet (Genetta genetta) from genomic libraries enriched for (AAAG) n and (AGAT) n repeat sequences. We chose to develop tetranucleotide repeats because they can be scored less ambiguously. In a sample of 25 individuals, we observed between four and thirteen alleles per locus and their observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.60 to 0.84 and from 0.68 to 0.92, respectively. All genotypic frequencies conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations and there were no instances of linkage disequilibrium detected between pairs of loci. These loci will be of use in studies of population genetics, historical demography, and molecular ecology of the common genet.
