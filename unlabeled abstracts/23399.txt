Daphnia species invasion, competitive exclusion, and chaotic coexistence
The cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi has invaded many US rivers and lakes. To better understand the ecological factors and consequences as-sociated with D. lumholtzi invasion, we carried out a microcosm experiment evaluating competition of D. lumholtzi with a widespread native daphnid, D. pulex. We applied two light treatments to these two different microcosms and found strong context-dependent competitive exclusion in both treatments. We observed that D. lumholtzi out-competed D. pulex in the high light treatment, while D. pulex out-competed D. lumholtzi in the low light treatment. To better understand these results we developed and tested a mechanistically formulated stoichiometric population interaction model. This model exhibits chaotic coex-istence of the competing species of Daphnia. The rich dynamics of this model allow us to suggest some plausible strategies to control the invasive species D. lumholtzi.
