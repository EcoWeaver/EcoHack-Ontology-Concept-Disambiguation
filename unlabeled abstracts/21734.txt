Characteristics of Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834) Populations in Fish Ponds (Upper Silesia, Southern Poland) in Relation to Environmental Factors Abstract
We analyzed the biomass, density and age structure of S. woodiana populations in relation to different environmental factors at new sites of its occurrence in southern Poland. The highest recorded biomass was 4,413 g m-2. Mussel density was 19 individuals m-2. The age structure was formed by juveniles as well as by specimens more than 8 years. The rapid expansion of S. woodiana in European countries is believed to be the result of accidental introduction of fishes bearing glochidia of this species.
