First record of the exotic species Hemiculter leucisculus (Pisces: Cyprinidae) in southern Iran
The occurrence of the sawbelly, Hemiculter leucisculus, is reported for the first time from the Halil River in the Hamun-e-Jazmourian basin, Kerman Province, southern Iran. The sawbelly is an exotic species in Iran. This species may have adverse effects on native fishes, as the sawbelly is an aggressive and territorial species that is well-known for its ability to rapidly colonize a body of water. This new data regarding its range demonstrates an extension of this species' known range further to the southern area of Iran.
