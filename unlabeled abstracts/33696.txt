Comprehensive and quantitative profiling of lipid molecular species by LC-ESI-MS/MS of four native species from semiarid Patagonian Monte
The maintenance of lipid and fatty acids unsaturated composition has been described as one of the mechanisms associated to drought tolerance, but research about the lipid profile in native plants of semiarid environment is still limited. The primary objective was to study whether lipid profiles correlates with drought resistance strategies (tolerant or avoidant) of two life forms (shrubs and grasses). The lipid classes and molecular species of green leaves of Larrea divaricata and Lycium chilense shrubs and Pappostipa speciosa and Poa ligularis grasses were determined using LC-ESI-MS/MS. The soil water content was very low during spring and leaf relative water content was between 47 and 74% in the four species. Lipid profiling was different between both life forms. The prevalent compounds were digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and phosphatidic acid (PA). The lipid signature shows that L. divaricata adjust its lipid composition to tolerate drought, increasing the content of: a) total lipids and total phospholipids, b) structural phospholipids (36:4 and 36:2-PC, phosphatidylcholine; 36:4-PE, phosphatidylethanolamine), c) chloroplast and mitochondria lipids (32:1 and 32:0-PG, phosphatidylglycerol; 34:3, 36:6 and 36:3-DGDG), d) signaling lipids (34:3, 34:2 and 36:5-PA and PI, phosphatidylinositol), and e) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, 18:3 and 18:2) and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs, in 40:2 and 42:2-PS, phosphatidylserine). This membrane lipid composition contributes to membrane stabilization as metabolic-functional strategy for drought tolerance in the Patagonian Monte. In addition, the 18:3 present in lipids of both grasses could be incorporated to lamb fed based on pastures and result healthy for human dietary.
