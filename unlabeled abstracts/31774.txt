Early successional ectomycorrhizal fungi are more likely to naturalize outside their native range than other ectomycorrhizal fungi
Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF) are the key symbionts of numerous woody plants in many ecosystems worldwide (Smith & Read, 2008; Tedersoo, 2017). They positively affect host plant nutrient uptake (Smith & Read, 2008) and take part in essential ecosystem processes such as carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling and decomposition of organic matter (Read & Perez-Moreno, 2003; Clemmensen et al., 2014; Shah et al., 2016). The majority of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) plants fully depend on the mycorrhizal symbionts and cannot complete their life cycle without these root associations (Smith & Read, 2008).
