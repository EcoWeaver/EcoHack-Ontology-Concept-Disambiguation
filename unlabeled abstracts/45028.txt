Interference competition among native and invader amphipods
Aquarium experiments were used to study indications of interference competition, such as substratum choice shifts, swimming activities and mortality of invasive and indigenous gammarids in each other's presence. The more recent invaders Gammarus tigrinus and Dikerogammarus villosus were more likely to prefer stone substratum, whereas the native Gammarus pulex and an earlier invader Gammarus roeseli were found more frequently in the water layer. Sand was the least likely substratum to be chosen by any of the species. G. pulex and G. roeseli did not alter their substratum preference in each other's presence. In the presence of D. villosus, G. pulex shifted towards smaller stones and increased its swimming activities, whereas D. villosus did not change its behaviour in the presence of G. pulex. These shifts may indicate interference competition, with D. villosus being the stronger competitor. The greatest shifts in substratum preference arose when one species had occupied a substratum before the other one was introduced, especially when D. villosus was already present before G. pulex was introduced, possibly indicating pre-emptive competition. Swimming activities of G. pulex increased in the presence of D. villosus, whereas D. villosus spent little time swimming. Mortality was comparable between the different experiments without any indication of predation. The effect of Intra Guild Predation (IGP) may not be reflected adequately by short-time experiments as moults occurred seldom during the experiments. Although no IGP was observed during our experiments, habitat shifts occurred, which may indicate that competitive interactions are apparent before IGP starts. Such shifts may serve to avoid intraguild competition.
