Impacts of invasive parasitoids on declining endemic Hawaiian leafroller moths (<i>Omiodes</i>: Crambidae) vary among sites and species
1. Invasive parasitoids and predators, both accidentally and purposefully introduced, have variously altered native insect communities worldwide, sometimes causing major declines and extinctions. Most species of endemic Hawaiian leafroller moth in the genus Omiodes (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) have suffered range reductions and local extirpations and some species appear to be extinct. Non-native parasitoids, particularly those introduced for biological control, have been implicated in declines of non-target Omiodes and other Hawaiian Lepidoptera.
