Euphorbia glyptosperma (Euphorbiaceae), an alien species new for the flora of Russia
A common North American species Euphorbia glyptosperma Engelm. (subgen. Chamaesyce Raf., sect. Anisophyllum Roep.) is reported for Russia for the first time. It was collected in Saratov, Rostov, Volgograd, Astrakhan administrative regions, the Republic of Kalmykia, Stavropol Territory, and the Republic of Dagestan during 1997-2006. It differs from morphologically similar species E. chamaesyce L. and E. humifusa Willd. in having prominent transverse ridges on the facets of seeds and very short styles. Now this species is likely expanding its secondary range in Russia, as well as in Western Europe.
