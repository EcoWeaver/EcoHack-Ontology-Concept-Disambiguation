Effects of pine invasion on anurans assemblage in southern Brazil coastal ponds
The destruction of wetlands due to afforestation areas is a common activity in temperate and subtropical regions in Southern America. The expansion of pine in the Coastal Plain of Southern Brazil is out of control and its impacts on aquatic biodiversity are little known. We tested the following hypotheses: the pine occurrence diminishes the anuran richness and abundance in ponds and it changes the anuran composition; the beta-diversity between pine and native grassland matrix ponds (natural ponds) is determined mainly by nestedness. Sampling was carried out from 2007 to 2009 in five ponds in pine invasion matrix and five ponds in native grassland matrix. The natural ponds showed a greater richness of tadpoles (10 species) than pine ponds (5 species). The mean richness of adults was higher in natural ponds than pine ponds throughout the entire study. The species composition was different between natural and pine ponds, for both adults and tadpoles. Comparing natural ponds with each other and the pine ponds with each other, our results showed that neither nestedness nor turnover was determinant for beta-diversity. However, when natural ponds were compared with pine ones, we found that the contribution of nestedness was higher for the anurans beta-diversity than turnover. Increases in the nestedness mechanism indicated that the pine occurrence results in species loss in Southern Brazil ponds. Since 90% of its wetland has been already affected, the removal ofPinusin the conservation areas in southern Brazil is important to minimize their impacts on aquatic biodiversity.
