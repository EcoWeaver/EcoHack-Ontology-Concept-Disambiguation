Effects of Introduced Bullfrogs, Rana catesbeiana, on the Native Frogs of the San Joaquin Valley, California
Rana catesbeiana was introduced into California between 1914 and 1920 and has since spread throughout the state. In the San Joaquin Valley it has become the dominant frog on the valley floor and has spread into the Sierra Nevada foothills. It is most abundant in the warm low elevation pools of the foothill streams, in areas heavily altered by man, although at least two populations are established above 1600 m elevation. Of the two frog species native to this region, R. aurora is either absent or very rare at the present time, while R. boylii is found mostly in small permanent foothill streams higher than 200 m elevation, in areas not occupied by R. catesbeiana. The disappearance of R. aurora from the region, and the continuing reduction in range of R. boylii, is attributed to habitat alteration coupled with predation and competition from R. catesbeiana.
