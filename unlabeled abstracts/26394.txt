Nine polymorphic microsatellite markers in Centaurea stoebe L. [subspecies C. s. stoebe and C. s. micranthos (S. G. Gmelin ex Gugler) Hayek] and C. diffusa Lam. (Asteraceae)
Centaurea stoebe (subspecies C. s. stoebe and C. s. micranthos[S. G. Gmelin ex Gugler) Hayek] and Centaurea diffusa are Eurasian plant species that have invaded much of North America. We isolated seven microsatellite loci from C. stoebe and two loci from C. diffusa. All loci described here amplify in both species and have between six and 25 alleles each. These markers will be useful in examining population structure and addressing questions regarding these invasions.
