Pollen limitation causes an Allee effect in a wind-pollinated invasive grass ( Spartina alterniflora )
It is usually assumed that pollen availability does not limit reproduction in wind-pollinated plants. Little evidence either supporting or contradicting this assumption exists, despite the importance of seed production to population persistence and growth. We investigated the role of pollen limitation in an invasive estuarine grass ( Spartina alterniflora ), with a manipulative pollen supplementation and exclusion experiment in areas of high population density and at the low-density leading edge of the invasion. We also quantified pollen deposition rates on stigmas and pollen traps along a windward to leeward gradient. We found pollen impoverishment at the low-density leading edge of a large invasion, causing an 8-fold reduction in seed set. We found 9-fold more pollen on stigmas of high-density plants than on those of low-density plants. Pollen deposition rates on stigmas and traps did not increase downwind of low-density plants but did increase downwind of high-density plants and dropped off precipitously across a gap that lacked pollen donors. The delay of appreciable numbers of seed caused by pollen limitation persists for decades until vegetative growth coalesces plants into continuous meadows, and this Allee effect has slowed the rate of spread of the invasion.
