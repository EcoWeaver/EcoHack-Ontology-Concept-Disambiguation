Abundance and composition of denitrifiers in response toSpartina alterniflorainvasion in estuarine sediment
Nitrite reduction is regulated by nitrite reductase encoded by nirK and nirS genes. This study aimed to investigate the abundance and composition of nirK- and nirS-containing denitrifiers in response to Spartina alterniflora invasion at the Jiulong River estuary, China. The sediment samples (depth: 0-5.0 and 5.1-20 cm) were collected from 3 vegetation zones, 1 dominated by the exotic plant S. alterniflora, 1 dominated by the native plant Kandelia candel, and 1 dominated by the native plant Cyperus malaccensis, and from an unvegetated flat zone. nirK- and nirS-containing denitrifier population sizes were lower in the invaded and nonvegetated zones than in those dominated by native K. candel and C. malaccensis, which were impacted by depth - vegetation species interaction. The ratios of nirS to nirK abundance ranged from 42.10 to 677.27, with the lowest ratio found for the upper layer in the invaded zone. The nirK-containing denitrifier compositions showed a 35% similarity between invaded zone and others. Most of the sequences of nirK genes recovered from the S. alterniflora zone were specific and distinct from those of nirK genes recovered from other vegetation types; nirS genes in the invaded zone were highly divergent. These results reveal that S. alterniflora invasion has a significant effect on the abundance and composition of both nirK- and nirS-containing denitrifiers, and nirS-containing denitrifiers were less responsive to invasion than nirK-containing denitrifiers.
