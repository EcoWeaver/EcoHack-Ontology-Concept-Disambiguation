The role of anglers in preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species in the Great Lakes region
The spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS) is an ongoing challenge in the Great Lakes region. Anglers play a pivotal role in preventing or contributing to the spread of these organisms. Anglers in the Great Lakes region were surveyed by mail during fall 2013 to assess their AIS-related awareness, knowledge, and concern as well as the actions they took to prevent the spread of AIS. Many anglers were aware of AIS, knowledgeable and concerned about them, and taking some actions to prevent their spread. However, certain actions, such as drying and disinfecting or rinsing equipment with hot water, were more difficult and were reported less frequently. Because many anglers already recognize the importance of taking action to prevent the spread of AIS, future outreach efforts may be able to deemphasize communication about the importance of taking action and focus more on strategies that will enable anglers to take these actions.
