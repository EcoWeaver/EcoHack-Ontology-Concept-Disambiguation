Invasion by Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) (Bivalvia, Mytilidae) of the Pantanal Wetland, Brazil
Limnoperna fortunei (Bivalvia, Mitylidae) was introduced into South America in 1991 in the La Plata River (Argentina). It arrived in the ballast water of ships coming from Asia, where this species is native. It was first observed in 1998 in the Paraguay River. Limnoperna was introduced into the Pantanal region as hull fouling of vessels using the Paraguay-Parana waterway. This study describes how L. fortunei came to the Pantanal region, and provides details of its occurrence, density, and impacts. From 1999 to 2002, observations and sampling on natural and artificial substrates in the Paraguay River were made. Some aspects of the spread and impacts, based on local community information, were also analyzed. On artificial substrate the density reached 523.8individualsm-2 and on natural substrate (rocks), up to 10,000individualsm-2 were found. The densities observed were quite low compared to those found in Southern Brazil, where values up to 100,000individualsm-2 have been recorded in the last 3years. In the Paraguay River, the population density of L. fortunei can be negatively impacted by periodic low levels of dissolved oxygen and decreases in pH to between 5 and 6. Such conditions are frequently present during the periodic flooding or inundation of this area. Under these conditions, a high mortality of L. fortunei was recorded in March of 2002, on both natural and artificial substrates. Despite low densities, L. fortunei can colonize water cooling systems of boats, obstructing water circulation and causing motor overheating. Accumulation in water supply equipment, such as pumps and pipes has also been observed.
