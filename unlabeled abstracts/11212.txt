Pueraria lobata is expanding and endangering in China ecosystems
Kudzu (Pueraria lobata) is an aggressive invasive species and has brought great loss world-widely. Though it is originated in China, it has not been considered as a weed in China. While more and more articles report its destructive effects on the native community throughout the whole country. We conducted an experiment to validate whether kudzu could endanger its native ecosystem and wanted to find the reason of its fast spreading from 2008 to 2010. Concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, water content, irradiance, pH, species number and aboveground biomass in the three sub-communities (Kudzu, Mixed and NonKudzu) were analyzed. Meanwhile, light irradiance and coverage of kudzu at 0, 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 m distance from the road surface verge were also measured. The results showed that kudzu evidently lowed the species biodiversity and obviously changed the water, light and nutrient cycles in its expanding area. Kudzu's rapid expansion is mainly because it can get full available space and light for growth by reason of anthropogenic disturbances. Our results indicated that Kudzu was a potential weed in China if great land changes from human activities are continuing.
