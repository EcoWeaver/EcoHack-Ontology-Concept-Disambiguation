Eurasian otters modify their trophic niche after the introduction of non-native prey in Mediterranean fresh waters
Biological invasions are a major driver behind disturbances in freshwater community structure. We investigated how the foraging strategy of the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra (L.) has responded to this change in a Mediterranean catchment of the Iberian Peninsula, over a 30-year time span (1980 vs. 2010). We found that, despite continuing to feed on a considerable amount of native fish, this carnivore has adapted its trophic niche to accommodate non-native species. Prior to the massive introductions of these new food items (1980), otters diversified their diet during the limiting season (i.e. summer drought). However, otters had largely incorporated non-native prey into their diet in 2010, with red-swamp crayfish being their main food resource, especially in the summer. This increased crayfish consumption reflects a narrowing of trophic niche during the summer drought in 2010. We discuss how this heavy specialisation may compromise the conservation of otters and their endemic fish prey.
