Water relations and the effects of clearing invasive Prosopis trees on groundwater in an arid environment in the Northern Cape, South Africa
Several Prosopis species have been introduced into South Africa in the last century and many of them have become invasive. This study investigates the water relations, effects of clearing, and the seasonal dynamics of groundwater use by invasive Prosopis trees. The trees were growing on deep sandy soils in the floodplain of an episodic river in the arid Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Data were collected on tree water uptake, evapotranspiration and water table depth over different seasons. Effects of tree clearing on groundwater were quantified by comparing data from a Prosopis invaded and an adjacent cleared area. Transpiration rates were less than 1.0 mm/d throughout the year and the trees showed structural and physiological adaptations to the combined low rainfall and low water holding capacity of the soils by developing very narrow sapwood areas and by closing their stomata. The trees abstracted groundwater as evidenced by the decline in borehole water levels in the Prosopis stand before the rainy season. Groundwater savings of up to 70 m3/month could be achieved in spring for each hectare of Prosopis cleared. The study suggests that clearing of invasive Prosopis would conserve groundwater in the arid parts of South Africa.
