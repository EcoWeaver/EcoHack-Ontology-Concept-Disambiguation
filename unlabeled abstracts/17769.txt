Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt (Fucales, Phaeophyta) in Morocco, an invasive marine species new to the Atlantic coast of Africa
The Japanese brown seaweed Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt (Fucales, Phaeophyta) is reported for the first time in Atlantic Morocco, along the shoreline of Doukkala (S of Casablanca). This record, the first in the African continent, represents a remarkable range expansion of this invasive marine species. Indeed, it is the southern-most occurrence of the species in the Atlantic. Preliminary phenological and ecological data of this non-native species were provided from the Doukkala coast. The major effects on benthic structure and composition of this invasive brown macroalga were also evaluated from published data. Oyster transfers from the French coast were the most likely primary introduction vector, but maritime vectors linked to shipping and navigation cannot be ruled out. Guidelines for prevention of further expansion of this highly invasive marine species along the Moroccan coasts are described.
