A male- and female-sterile mutant of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) induced by space radiation
Female sterile plants are ideal for isolating genes involved in megasporogenesis and for investigating gene functions. Engineered female and male sterilities in plants have been considered as a way to reduce the potential of invasive species by eliminating seed set and to prevent gene flow between genetically modified species. A dwarf mutant 'PM2' induced by carrying 'Nassau' Kentucky bluegrass seeds to outer space lost the ability to produce seeds under either field conditions or artificial flower induction, whereas the untreated control was normal. Comparative study of microspore, macrospore, and embryo sac at different developmental stages along with controlled pollination showed that the PM2 mutant is likely both male and female sterile. The apoporous embryo development in PM2 aborted at globular stage prior to coleoptile formation. Multiple genes may be involved in the mutation based on the evidence observed from the morphology and anatomy of the mutant.
