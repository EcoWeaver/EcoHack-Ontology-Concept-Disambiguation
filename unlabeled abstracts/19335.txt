Natal habitat effects drive density-dependent scaling of dispersal decisions
The dispersal behavior of a species is critical for the stability and persistence of its populations across a landscape. How population density affects dispersal decisions is important for predicting these dynamics, as the form of density-dependent dispersal influences the stability and persistence of populations. Natal habitat experience often has strong impacts on individual dispersal behavior as well, but its influence on density-dependent dispersal behaviors remains unexplored. Here we address this conceptual gap in two experiments separately examining habitat selection and emigration from recently colonized patches for two species of flour beetle Tribolium sp. We found that interactions between the quality of habitat experienced during natal development and current habitat for dispersal capable adults can strongly affect the form of density dependence, including reversing the direction of nonlinearities (accelerating to decelerating), or even negating the influence of population density for individual dispersal decisions. Across heterogeneous landscapes, where individuals from different populations may experience different natal habitats, this altering of density-dependent relationships is predicted by theory to fundamentally influence regional population dynamics. Our results indicate that species which occur across heterogeneous environments, such as during conservation reintroductions, or as invasive species spread, have much potential for natal experience to interact with density dependence and influence local and regional population dynamics.
