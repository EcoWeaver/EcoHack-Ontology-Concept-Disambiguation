Helminth species richness of introduced and native grey mullets (Teleostei: Mugilidae).
Quantitative complex analyses of parasite communities of invaders across different native and introduced populations are largely lacking. The present study provides comparative analysis of species richness of helminth parasites in native and invasive populations of grey mullets. The total species richness differed between regions and host species, but did not differ when compared invasive and native hosts. The size of parasite assemblages of endohelminths was higher in the Mediterranean and Azov-Black Sea, while monogeneans were the most diverse in the Sea of Japan. The helminth diversity was apparently higher in the introduced population of L. haematocheilus than in those of their native habitat, but this trend could not be confirmed when size of geographic range and sampling efforts were controlled for. The parasite species richness at the infracommunity level of the invasive host population is significantly lower in comparison with native host populations that lending support to the enemy release hypothesis. A distribution pattern of the infracommunity richness of acquired parasites by the invasive host can be characterized as aggregated and it is random in native host populations. Heterogeneity in the host susceptibility and vulnerability to acquired helminth species assumed to be a reason of the aggregation of species numbers in population of the invasive host.
