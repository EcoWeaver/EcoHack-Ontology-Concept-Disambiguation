Reciprocal trophic niche shifts in native and invasive fish: salmonids and galaxiids in Patagonian lakes
1. Rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are widespread and invasive salmonids with important lethal effects as predators, although indirect effects are also possible. We used stable isotope analyses (d15N, d13C) to explore how the density of invasive trout in 25 Patagonian lakes alters the trophic niche (TN) of a widespread native fish, Galaxias platei (Galaxiidae). We also explored how the density of the galaxiid influences the TN of invasive trout. 2. We quantified two aspects of the TN: (i) the proportion of littoral carbon (PL) and (ii) trophic height (TH) (i.e. the 'height' at which the fish feeds in the food web). We related these measures of TN in a given species to the density of other species (as estimated by catch-per-unit-effort). 3. As G. platei body size increased, their PL increased (increasing littoral feeding) in several lakes. However, none of the fish species investigated showed changes in PL with increasing density of the other fish species. TH increased with body size in all three species. In addition, the TH of large G. platei declined with increasing trout density and, reciprocally, the TH of large S. trutta decreased with decreasing G. platei density. 4. The reciprocal effects of native and the invasive fish on TH were as large as a shift of one trophic level. This pattern is consistent with an exhaustion of galaxiid prey for both piscivorous G. platei and S. trutta in lakes with high trout density. 5. These finding support the suggested management strategy of culling trout from overpopulated lakes, which should simultaneously protect native fish and enhance a lucrative sport fishery for large trout.
