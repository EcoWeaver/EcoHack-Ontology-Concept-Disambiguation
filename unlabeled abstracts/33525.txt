Newly-introduced Cardinium endosymbiont reduces microbial diversity in the rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens
Symbiotic microorganisms in invertebrates play vital roles in host ecology and evolution. Cardinium, a common intracellular symbiont, is transinfected into the important agricultural pest Nilaparvata lugens (rice brown planthopper) to regulate its reproduction, but how this impacts its microbial community is unknown. Here, we characterized the bacterial microbiota from N. lugens, with or without Cardinium, at different developmental stages and in various adult tissues using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Upon infection with Cardinium, we found that microbial diversity in the different developmental stages of N. lugens (especially females), and in female midguts and male testes, was lower than in the uninfected control. There was a negative correlation between Cardinium and most related genera and between Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Although the microbial structure varied during Cardinium infection, Acinetobacter spp. was a core microbiome genus. The Cardinium infection enhanced the relative density of midgut-associated Acinetobacter spp., with both bacteria exhibiting tissue-specific tropism. In addition, this infection caused the changes of main microbial functions in N. lugens. These results offer insights into the effects of alien (i.e. newly-introduced from other organism) Cardinium infection on N. lugens-associated microbiotas, aiding in the development of transinfected endosymbionts for pest control.
