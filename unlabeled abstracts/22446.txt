Getting here from there: testing the genetic paradigm underpinning introduction histories and invasion success
Aim To explore the potential of genetic processes and mating systems to influence successful plant invasions, we compared genetic diversity of the highly invasive tropical treelet, Miconia calvescens, in nine invasive populations and three native range populations. Specifically, we tested how genetic diversity is partitioned in native and invaded regions, which have different invasion histories (multiple vs. single introductions). Lastly, we infer how levels of inbreeding in different regions impact invasion success.
