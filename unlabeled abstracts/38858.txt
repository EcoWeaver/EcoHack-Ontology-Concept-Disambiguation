The Brazilian elodea (Egeria densa Planch.) invasion reaches Southeast Europe
Egeria densa is a South American aquatic plant species considered highly invasive outside of its original range, especially in temperate and warm climates and artificially heated waters in colder regions. We report the first occurrence and the spread of E. densa in Southeast Europe, along with physicochemical and phytosociological characteristics of its habitats. Flowering male populations were observed and monitored in limnocrene springs and rivers in the Mediterranean part of Croatia from 2013 to 2017. The populations inhabited clear, slow flowing, oligohaline water with high alkalinity and conductivity. Over the course of our research, the species displayed its invasive potential forming monospecific stands and surpassing the native flora in particular localities, while being obviously codominant with indigenous species in others. Although we cannot specify the exact path of introduction, we presume two possible scenarios: release from aquaria or epizoochory through water birds. The current situation in SE Europe, including Croatia, seems satisfactory regarding the number of aquatic alien species; nevertheless a careful and systematic approach to research into the management of invasive alien species is needed.
