Listeria monocytogenes : cell biology of invasion and intracellular growth
ABSTRACT The Gram-positive pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is able to promote its entry into a diverse range of mammalian host cells by triggering plasma membrane remodeling, leading to bacterial engulfment. Upon cell invasion, L. monocytogenes disrupts its internalization vacuole and translocates to the cytoplasm, where bacterial replication takes place. Subsequently, L. monocytogenes uses an actin-based motility system that allows bacterial cytoplasmic movement and cell-to-cell spread. L. monocytogenes therefore subverts host cell receptors, organelles and the cytoskeleton at different infection steps, manipulating diverse cellular functions that include ion transport, membrane trafficking, post-translational modifications, phosphoinositide production, innate immune responses as well as gene expression and DNA stability.
