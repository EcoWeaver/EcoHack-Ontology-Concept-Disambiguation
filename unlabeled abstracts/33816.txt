The complete chloroplast genome of new alien species, <i>Celosia trigyna</i> L. (Amaranthaceae), in China
The first complete chloroplast genome sequences of new alien weeds in Guangdong, Celosia, were reported in this study. The C. trigyna plastome was 152,089 bp long, with the large single copy (LSC) region of 83,716 bp, the small single copy (SSC) region of 17,251 bp, and two inverted repeat (IR) regions of 25,561 bp. The plastome contained 130 genes, including 85 proteincoding, eight ribosomal RNA, and 37 transfer RNA genes. The overall GC content was 36.9%. Phylogenetic analysis of 21 representative plastomes within the order Caryophyllales suggests that C. trigyna is closely related to the species in genus Amaranthus.
