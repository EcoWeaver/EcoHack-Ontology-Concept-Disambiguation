Eco-physiological performance of two invasive weed congeners (Ageratum conyzoides L. and Ageratum houstonianum Mill.) in the Indo-Gangetic plains of India
Morphological (easily measureable) and physiological (hard to measure) traits of two closely related invasive alien congeners-Ageratum conyzoides L. and Ageratum houstonianum Mill. were studied with a perspective that which species will be potentially be more successful as an invader in the Indo-Gangetic plains of India. Leaf construction cost (LCC) is considered as a quantifiable measure of energy demand for biomass production and is related to energy use efficiency as it include component of both morphological and physiological traits. We hypothesised that a low LCC would give the invaders growth advantage by utilizing energy efficiently. Low LCC of A. houstonianum on mass basis (0.54 g glucose g (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)) and area basis (20.48 g m (-aEuro parts per thousand 2)) gives insight into the success of this invasive weed over A. conyzoides. The present study gives evidence that how the morphological traits are linked to physiological traits that could directly affect invasive attributes of the invader, which in turn would be crucial to prioritize species for ecosystem management.
