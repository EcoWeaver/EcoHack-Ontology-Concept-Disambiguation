Effects of detrital non-native and native macroalgae on the nitrogen and carbon cycling in intertidal sediments
The decay of non-native and native seaweed mixing may modify sediment biogeochemistry and organic matter transfers within benthic food webs according to their composition and biomass. The non-native species Sargassum muticum was deliberately added to the sediment of an intertidal sandflat at different biomass and mixed to the native species Ulva sp. and Fucus vesiculosus. The sediment porewater was then 13C and 15N enriched to test whether both detrital diversity and biomass influenced the transfer of porewater carbon and nitrogen to the sediment and to the macrofauna consumers. More 15N-nitrogen was mobilized to sediments and macrofauna when the 3-species detrital mixing was buried, probably because this mixing provided species-specific compounds such as polyphenols due to the presence of S. muticum and F. vesiculosus, as well as large amounts of nitrogen due to the presence of Ulva. Our study revealed the importance of detrital diversity and non-native seaweeds for the nitrogen cycling in the benthic food web.
