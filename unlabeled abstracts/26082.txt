Ramet Demography of a Clonal Invader, Arundo donax (Poaceae), in Southern California
Arundo donax L. is a rhizomatous perennial, asexually reproducing species that has invaded riparian habitats throughout Mediterranean climate zones. This research evaluated ramet demography of A. donax in two California riparian communities that differed in nitrogen availability. Quadrats were established along 100 m transects at each site and oriented across the advancing fronts of established populations. Morphology and phenology were assessed monthly over 1 year for calculation of demographic parameters and rhizomes were excavated and mapped at the end of the experiment. A. donax exhibited seasonal patterns of recruitment but no dormancy at the high nitrogen site, while at the low nitrogen site no recruitment occurred in the winter and maximum recruitment was delayed by a month relative to the high nitrogen site. Spread of A. donax was delayed until spring and lower overall in the low nitrogen site compared to the high nitrogen site, where lower initial density, greater production of shoots, and higher linear and areal addition indicated that this population was spreading more rapidly. Temperature and precipitation influenced seasonality and amount of recruitment of A. donax in this study. Several recently established, immature clumps were found in gaps at the low nitrogen site, likely due to flood-mediated dispersal of propagules. Recruitment in these clumps occurred from shoot buds, in contrast to the mature populations that reproduced from rhizome buds. Ecologically based management strategies for A. donax and other exotic species should account for differences such as those described here and be tailored to local conditions where the species occurs.
