Sexual reproduction of two alien invasive Ludwigia (Onagraceae) on the middle Loire River, France
Ludwigia peploides (Kunth) Raven ssp. montevidensis (Spreng.) Raven and Ludwigia grandiflora (Michaux) Greuter and Burdet ssp. hexapetala (Hooker and Arn.) Nesom and Kartesz, are expanding their geographic range due to clonal reproduction; these taxa are considered the most important nuisance aquatic plants in French river habitats. During 1970s, these two species have colonized former channels and river banks of the middle Loire River, previously scarcely covered by aquatic vegetation. Now, the exotic Ludwigia build up dense and continuous stands with potentially high impact on biodiversity and sedimentation rates.
