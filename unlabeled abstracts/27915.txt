A First Approximation of the Historical and Extant Vascular Flora of New York City: Implications for Native Plant Species Conservation
This historical and extant vascular flora of greater New York City is a literature review supplemented with field work and examination of herbarium specimens held in New York State. For the historical and modern periods combined, 2177 species in 779 genera and 161 families were found in New York City. The City retains 57.4% of its native plant species diversity with 779 extant native species compared to 1357 ever recorded. Extirpations have disproportionately affected native vs. non-native species. Staten Island (Richmond County) has the greatest diversity of the five boroughs with 154 families and 1633 species known from both the historical and modern time periods combined, as well as the greatest number of extant species (921), and the greatest number of native extant species (621). However it has lost approximately 35% of its native flora in the last 70 years. Brooklyn (Kings County) has the lowest diversity of any borough with 695 native and alien species known from both the historical and modern periods combined. Manhattan (New York County) and Brooklyn have lost more than 75% of their native species. Queens County has lost the greatest number of native species (585). In New York City since the mid-19th century, 46.4% of all native herbaceous species have been extirpated, while 22.9% of native woody plants have been lost. In the last 70 years, extirpations have continued even in natural areas protected in parks. Strategies are recommended for preserving New York City's significant native plant species diversity.
