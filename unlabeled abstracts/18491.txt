Heterogeneous nonmarket benefits of managing white pine bluster rust in high-elevation pine forests
This article describes a nonmarket valuation study about benefits of managing the invasive disease white pine blister rust in high-elevation forests in the Western United States. Results demonstrate that, on average, households in the Western United States are willing to pay $154 to improve the resiliency of these forests. Factor analysis shows that long-run protection of the forests dominates recreation in motivating support. Cluster analysis suggests three groups of survey respondents: those indifferent to the program and not willing to pay, those wanting to protect the future of the high-elevation forests, and those wanting to protect both the forests and related recreational opportunities.
