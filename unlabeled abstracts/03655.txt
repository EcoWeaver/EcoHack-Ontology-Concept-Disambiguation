Invasive giant hogweeds in Poland: Risk of burns among forestry workers and plant distribution
The Caucasian giant hogweeds (Heracleum sosnowskyi Manden. and H. manntegazzianum Sommier et Lever) are aggressive invaders that are successfully spreading in different parts of the world. The skin exposure to these plants may lead to phototoxicity and even chemical burns manifested by cutaneous, full-thickness, long-lasting dermatitis and in extreme cases, massive skin necrosis. Employees of the forest service represent a group who have a potentially increased risk of exposure to these plants due to the outdoor nature of their work and their active involvement in the management of invasive species. Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate level of their awareness with regard to the giant hogweeds in Poland (Europe), The morphology of the plants, health threats, treatment and control methods were all considered. We also evaluated the distribution of these plants within forest districts in Poland. For this reason, we surveyed a total of 1563 employees (forest rangers, manual workers and administration staff) of The State Forests National Forest Holding in Poland "State Forests" working in 367 Forest Districts. It was found that forestry workers were generally aware of the giant hogweed morphology and phototoxicity. Over 20% of surveyed individuals had been exposed to these plants at least once, but only less than half of them were aware how to proceed afterwards. At the same time, less than 35% of those surveyed had any knowledge on the control and management methods of the giant hogweeds. As demonstrated by our study, stands of these species are widely distributed within the Polish forest districts (reported in over 50%). Therefore, there is an urgent need to implement an efficient, multi-strategic, long-term approach in order to control their spread and protect both human health.
