Diet selection of the southern vizcacha (Lagidium viscacia): a rock specialist in north western Patagonian steppe, Argentina
The southern vizcacha (Lagidium viscacia) is a rock specialist that inhabits small colonies in isolated rocky outcrops of northwestern Patagonia. This study analyzes its diet selection in relation to food availability, establishes the degree of dietary specialization, and discusses the potential competition with exotic herbivores. Diet composition and food availability were determined in summer and winter in eight rocky outcrops by microhistological analysis of fecal pellets, and food availability was estimated by the Braun Blanquet cover abundance scale. Vegetation cover differences were detected by using a random analysis of variance (ANOVA) factorial block design, and dietary preferences were determined by the confidence interval of Bonferroni. The southern vizcacha showed a specialized feeding behavior despite the consumption of a wide variety of items. Their diet was concentrated on a few types of food, mainly grasses, and the trophic niche was narrow and without seasonal variations. In winter, when food was scarce and of lower quality than summer, diet was dominated by Stipa speciosa, suggesting a selection according to the selective quality hypothesis. Our results (narrow trophic niche, restricted activity near rocky outcrops, and a diet with high proportions of low-quality grasses) showed that the vizcacha is an obligatory dietary specialist, and these characteristics made it highly vulnerable to changes in food availability. In this scenario, overgrazing caused by alien species with similar diets, as the European hare and livestock, could negatively affect their colonies.
