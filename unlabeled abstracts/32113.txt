Biological invasions in terrestrial ecosystems - Science and management
Are concepts related to biological invasions in terrestrial ecosystems relevant to marine ecosystems? To address this question we start with a definition of "biological invasion" and some observations that show that this question is of more than academic interest. Several results are presented that show why scientists should consider biological invasions as experiments and should collaborate with managers to develop effective management procedures. Likewise, several results from "pure" science have been highly useful for conservation managers.
