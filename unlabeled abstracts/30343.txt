An invasive plant and climate change threat index for weed risk management: Integrating habitat distribution pattern and dispersal process
Invasive plants pose a significant threat to the integrity and biodiversity of native systems. Weed risk assessment and management provides a framework for assessing this threat. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the threat posed to biodiversity by invasive plants in a rapidly changing climate. This paper aims to estimate the impacts of climate change on exotic plant habitats, and incorporates elements of dispersal to develop a management index for identifying invasive plant threat under climate change. The spatial distribution of habitat suitability is modelled at the landscape scale for multiple exotic plant species under current climate and a climate change scenario for the year 2030. Expert opinion of the dominant dispersal mechanisms and weed status is used to model relative dispersal threat of each exotic plant species. These pattern and process outputs are integrated to create a multi-species management priority layer in an effort to synthesise the inherently complex outputs from multiple models of multiple species. The overall multi-species management index thus combines pattern and process to identify geographic locations at greatest threat from invasion under climate change.
