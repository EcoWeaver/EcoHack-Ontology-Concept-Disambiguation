Predicting future invaders and future invasions
Significance Biological invasions are the second most severe threat affecting biodiversity worldwide with major economic and societal impacts. Yet, the multitude of species with the potential to be invasive makes it extremely difficult to anticipate invasions to develop efficient management plans. Predicting which species are likely to become invaders and where they are likely to invade even before their introduction outside their native range has always been a prime objective of invasion biology. Based on the example of ants, we provide a profiling method to predict future invaders and future invasions, and in this manner, we identify 18 ant species likely to become new invaders and regions at risk for these invasions.
