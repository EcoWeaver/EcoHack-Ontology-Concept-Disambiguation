Native habitat mitigates feast-famine conditions faced by honey bees in an agricultural landscape
Significance Industrial-scale production of crops through monocultures has resulted in "green deserts" of reduced biodiversity in many areas worldwide. Such simplified landscapes may impact ecosystem services such as pollination. Here, we present a large-scale, longitudinal study of managed honey bee colonies in the context of corn and soybean monocultures. Our results reveal a brief burst of colony growth during soybean bloom, followed by a longer period of forage dearth, resulting in decline in several aspects of honey bee health at both colony and individual levels. We demonstrate this decline is reversible when honey bees have access to native, perennial plants (i.e., prairie). Our results suggest sustainable pollinator management in landscapes dominated by monocultures can be achieved through reintegration of native biodiversity.
