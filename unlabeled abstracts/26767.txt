Prey availability and diet of the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) on a large reservoir and associated tributaries
Eurasian otter, Lutra lutra (L., 1758), spraints collected at the Aguieira hydroelectric dam (central Portugal, n = 916) and tributaries (n = 412) were analysed to assess diet compared with prey availability. Fish and crayfish abundances in the reservoir were assessed with fyke and trammel nets. Prey availability in the tributaries was estimated by electrofishing. In both the reservoir and its tributaries, fish were the main prey and consisted predominantly of Lepomis gibbosus (L., 1758) (60%-65% of occurrences), which is an introduced species of Centrachidae that is abundant in the reservoir but is almost absent in the tributaries. These data suggest that otters using the tributaries feed predominantly in the reservoir. Seasonal dietary variations corresponded to increased availability of nonfish prey categories. Capture vs. consumption analyses demonstrated that otters did not consume L. gibbosus according to its availability. In fact, L. gibbosus was consumed less frequently when other prey species were more available (e.g., amphibians, eels, barbells). The tributaries offer important otter refuge areas that are scarce at the edge of the reservoir, and so, in large reservoirs care should be taken to minimize disturbance in the surrounding catchments. Results indicate that otter populations make use of these conjoint systems to ensure their survival.
