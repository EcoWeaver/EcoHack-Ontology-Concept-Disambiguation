Predation by blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, on rapa whelks, Rapana venosa: possible natural controls for an invasive species?
Blue crabs Callinectes sapidus are voracious predators in Chesapeake Bay and other estuarine habitats. The rapa whelk Rapana venosa is native to Asian waters but was discovered in Chesapeake Bay in 1998. This predatory gastropod grows to large terminal sizes (in excess of 150 mm shell length (SL)) and has a thick shell that may contribute to an ontogenetic predation refuge. However, juvenile rapa whelks in Chesapeake Bay may be vulnerable to predation by the blue crab given probable habitat overlap, relative lack of whelk shell architectural defenses, and the relatively large size of potential crab predators. Feeding experiments using three size classes of blue crab predators in relation to a size range of rapa whelks of two different ages (Age 1 and Age 2) were conducted. Blue crabs of all sizes tested consumed Age 1 rapa whelks; 58% of all Age 1 whelks offered were eaten. Age 2 rapa whelks were consumed by medium (67% of whelks offered were eaten) and large (70% of whelks offered were eaten) blue crabs but not by small crabs. The attack methods of medium and large crabs changed with whelk age and related shell weight. Age 1 whelks were typically crushed by blue crabs while Age 2 whelk shells were chipped or left intact by predators removing prey. Rapa whelks less than approximately 35 mm SL are vulnerable to predation by all sizes of blue crabs tested. Rapa whelk critical size may be greater than 55 mm SL in the presence of large blue crabs indicating that a size refugia from crab predation may not be achieved by rapa whelks in Chesapeake Bay until at least Age 2 or Age 3. Predation by blue crabs on young rapa whelks may offer a natural control strategy for rapa whelks in Chesapeake Bay and other estuarine habitats along the North American Atlantic coast.
