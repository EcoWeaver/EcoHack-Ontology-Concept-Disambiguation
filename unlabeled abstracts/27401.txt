A three-stage micropropagation system for a novel color morph of the wildflower, Porteranthus trifoliatus (L.) Britt
A three-stage micropropagation system was devised for Porteranthus trifoliatus 'Pink Profusion', a cultivar distinguished from the wild type by its pink flowers, purple stems and darker reddish leaves. Nodes of young shoots were used as explants, disinfested, and placed on several different Murashige and Skoog's (MS) media formulations containing two levels of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and four levels of benzylaminopurine (BAP) in a factorial combination. An optimal number of commercially-usable shoots was achieved with BAP concentrations between 10mM and 30mM, while the addition of IBA made no significant difference in the number of shoots produced. Proliferated shoots could be rooted exvitro without auxin treatment.
