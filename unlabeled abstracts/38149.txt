First record of invasive rugose spiraling whitefly Aleurodicus rugioperculatus Martin (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) along with parasitoids in Karnataka
Occurrence of the invasive rugose spiraling whitefly (RSW), Aleurodicus rugioperculatus Martin was found on coconut, banana, mango, guava, sapota, Indian almond, water apple, ball tree, rubber fig, butterfly palm, and ruffled fan palm for the first time in Karnataka. Severe damage was noticed in the coastal areas of Mangalore and Udupi and the infestation ranged from 20-35% in coconut and 24-38% in banana. Morphology and molecular based taxonomic tools were used to identity the pest and its natural enemies. Survey also revealed natural parasitism by the parasitoids Encarsia guadeloupae Viggiani and E. dispersa Polaszek (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) with 5-15% in coconut, 7-18% in banana and 22-30% in sapota. Besides, other commonly found natural enemies viz., Stethorus sp. associated with mites and Dichochrysa astur were also recorded. Furthermore, augmentation and conservation strategies for these parasitoids for the management of this invasive pest were discussed.
