Virgins in the vanguard: low reproductive frequency in invasion-front cane toads
The rapid evolution of increased dispersal rate during a population's range expansion provides a unique opportunity to detect trade-offs between dispersal and reproduction. If a high reproductive rate slows down an individual's dispersal, vanguard individuals should exhibit a lower reproductive output than conspecifics from long-colonized areas. In the present study, we demonstrate a reduction in reproductive rate in highly dispersive invasion-front populations of cane toads in tropical Australia.
