Invasive alien plants and environmental remediation: a new paradigm for sustainable restoration ecology
This paper explores some fundamental aspects of ecological restoration dynamics when an ecosystem is exposed to and altered by environmental disturbances like invasive alien plants and metals/particulates. These dynamics are assessed in socio-economic and phytoremediation terms with respect to the perspective of emerging nations (e.g., an Indo-Burma global biodiversity hotspot). In this short report, we discussed the positive ecological uses of invasive alien plants in remediation/restoration of the contaminated environment. Therefore, the impacts of invasive alien plants on ecosystem are analyzed as prerequisite for remediation/restoration efforts. The utility of an integrated approach is proposed as a promising option to help restore or sustain the socio-ecological systems from diverse disturbances. This article is protected by copyright.
