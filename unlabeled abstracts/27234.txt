Is the invasion of Prorocentrum minimum (Dinophyceae) related to the nitrogen enrichment of the Baltic Sea?
The abundance of the invasive, bloom-forming dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum (Pavillard) Schiller and triangular, oval, and oval-round cell shapes were examined relative to salinity, temperature, and nutrient concentrations at the selected sites in the Baltic Sea. Based on the multiple regression and multivariate statistical analysis, all cell shapes of P. minimum had highly similar distribution relative to these environmental parameters as well as chlorophyll-a, nitrite + nitrate, ammonium, total nitrogen, phosphate, total phosphorus, and silicate. The species was related positively to total nitrogen, and negatively to salinity, temperature, nitrite + nitrate, and silicate:total nitrogen ratio. The results suggest that P. minimum could well adapt to low salinity and temperature and occurred particularly in coastal waters, rich in total nitrogen relative to silicate or other inorganic nutrients. These results indicate that the recent invasion of P. minimum into the Baltic Sea could have been enhanced by the DON enrichment. The results also support the suggestion that P. minimum is one morphospecies with no distinct subtaxa.
