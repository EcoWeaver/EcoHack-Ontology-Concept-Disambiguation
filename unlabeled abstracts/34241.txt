Invasive species in Ontario: The threat, the strategy, and the law
As international communities and economies become increasingly inter-connected, introductions of non-native species have the potential to increase in frequency. With more and more real-world examples demonstrating the ecological and economic impacts that invasive non-native species can have, governments around the globe are becoming increasingly aware that action is necessary to address these threats. This paper reviews some of the key actions that Ontario has recently undertaken to tackle the invasive species issue, including implementing the Ontario Invasive Species Strategic Plan, and putting into force the Invasive Species Act. For this special issue on forest pathogens, several invasive pathogens of concern in Ontario are highlighted, with a brief discussion of how these new provincial policies could play a role in protecting forest health moving forward.
