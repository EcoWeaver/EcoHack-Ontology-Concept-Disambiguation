Unexpected alien species in Cyprus waters: Acanthurus coeruleus (Actinopterygii: Acanthuridae)
In December 2011 a specimen of the blue tang surgeonfish Acanthurus coeruleus was observed in the waters of Cyprus. As this species typically lives in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean, its presence in the Mediterranean Sea is very likely to be related to human activities. Speculated ways of introduction in the Mediterranean Sea are discussed.
