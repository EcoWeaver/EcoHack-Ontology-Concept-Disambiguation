Proteomic analysis of the venom and venom sac of the woodwasp, Sirex noctilio - Towards understanding its biological impact
Significance: The woodwasp Sirex noctilio is an invasive species in many parts of the world, including Australia and North America, where it is considered within the top 10 most serious forest insects. Where they have been introduced, the female woodwasps attack living pine trees, causing significant economic losses. Central to this destruction is the woodwasp's life cycle requirement to bore a hole to deposit eggs and a toxic mucus that disables the tree's network for transporting water and nutrients, yes aids in larval survival. Here we specifically examine the mucus gland apparatus and its contents, revealing the protein components that together with 'noctilisin' facilitate this complex association. The identification of chemosensory binding proteins further supports a role for the woodwasp ovipositor as an instrument for early stages of host tree selection. These findings could provide important clues toward the development of novel control tools against this pest.
