Competition and facilitation between the alien mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and indigenous species: Moderation by wave action
As the alien species that most dominates space along the South African coast, the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis has radically altered community composition on invaded shores. We experimentally assessed interspecific interactions between this invasive species and dominant indigenous species in conjunction with considering how wave action moderates such interactions. The density of both M. galloprovincialis and the limpet Scutellastra granularis increased with wave action. Conversely, the tube-building polycheate Gunnarea capensis was negatively affected by wave exposure, being most abundant on sheltered shores. The influence of wave action on the indigenous mussel Aulacomya ater, however, remains unclear. M. galloprovincialis outcompeted both G. capensis and A. ater at moderate to high exposure levels, whereas it had both positive and negative effects on S. granularis. It outcompeted adult limpets on primary rock space on semi-exposed and exposed shores, reducing densities of this portion of the population. However, recruitment of S. granularis was facilitated by M. galloprovincialis, as greater numbers recruited to the secondary substratum offered by mussel shells. Again this interaction intensified with wave action. Due to the extremely high density of recruits on secondary space, the net effect of M. galloprovincialis on S. granularis was positive. Thus, wave action not only influences the abundance of individual species, but also mediates both positive and negative interspecific interactions in rocky shore communities, including the impact of alien species such as M. galloprovincialis.
