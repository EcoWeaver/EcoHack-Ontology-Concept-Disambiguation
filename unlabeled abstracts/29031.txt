Invasive Marine Seaweeds: Pest or Prize?
Seaweeds were among the first harvested human food supplies in several parts of the world and are today valuable natural resources. They are, however, part of one of the most pressing conservation issues of our time: biological invasions. Global patterns of biodiversity are changing by relocations of organisms at the species and subspecies levels, with the latter often remaining cryptic. The increasing occurrence of marine invasions is mainly due to intensifying maritime traffic and global environmental changes. Following introduction, if suitable conditions for survival occur in the "recipient" environment, seaweeds will establish and spread. Many high-profile invasive seaweeds are commercially used in their native range and have biological traits similar to high-yield terrestrial crops, e.g., high growth rates. The incentives to introduce potentially invasive taxa for commercial use are significant. However, the associated environmental risks are high and robust strategies to prevent and control intentional and accidental seaweed introductions remain essential. For industrial and commercial use, preference should be given to the harvesting and culture of native seaweeds.
