Indirect food web effects of Bythotrephes invasion: responses by the rotifer Conochilus in Harp Lake, Canada
As a recent invader of North American lakes, Bythotrephes longimanus has induced large changes in crustacean zooplankton communities through direct predation effects. Here we demonstrate that Bythotrephes can also have indirect food web effects, specifically on rotifer fauna. In historical time series data, the densities of the colonial rotifer Conochilus unicornis significantly increased after Bythotrephes invasion in Harp Lake, Ontario. No such changes were observed in a non-invaded reference lake, the nearby Red Chalk Lake. Evidence for two mechanisms explaining the Conochilus increase was examined based on changes to the crustacean zooplankton community over time. Rapid and severe declines in several herbivorous species of cladoceran zooplankton after Bythotrephes detection indicated a decrease in exploitative competition pressure on Conochilus. Secondly, a later and significant decline to virtual extinction of native invertebrate predators (Mesocyclops and Leptodora) could account for the observed Conochilus increase which also began 1-2years after invasion by Bythotrephes. Ultimately, it appears that both reduced competition followed by a loss of native invertebrate predators were necessary to lead to the large Conochilus densities observed following invader establishment. From this analysis of long-term community data, it appears that Bythotrephes has important indirect, as well as direct, food web effects in newly invaded North American lakes with implications for trophic relationships.
