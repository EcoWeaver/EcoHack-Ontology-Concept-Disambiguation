Biological introductions or native ranges: two curious cases of new distributional records in the Panama Canal
We report two new, curious records of freshwater worms collected in the Panama Canal, Panama: the ribbon worm, Apatronemertes albimaculosa Wilfert and Gibson, 1974, and the leech, Placobdella parasitica (Say, 1824). Identification of these specimens relied on morphological examinations and, more heavily, on molecular barcoding using the mitochondrial COI locus. Both phylogenetic and genetic distance analyses were employed to robustly establish the identities of the specimens. Whereas the native range of A. albimaculosa is currently unknown, P. parasitica was first described from Minnesota, USA and is possibly native to southern Canada and most of the USA. Neither species has previously been recorded from Central America. We briefly discuss possible scenarios for the dispersal of both species, and conclude that the introduction of P. parasitica into Panamanian waters was likely human-mediated in association with the introduction of its turtle host. Insofar as ours is the first record of wild-caught A. albimaculosa worldwide, we do not exclude the possibility of Panama being within the native range of the species. However, it is also possible that the species has been transported with ballast water into the Panama Canal; a relatively common phenomenon.
