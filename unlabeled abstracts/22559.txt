Ecophysiological studies of the non-indigenous speciesGracilaria vermiculophylla(Rhodophyta) and its abundance patterns in Ria de Aveiro lagoon, Portugal
Gracilaria vermiculophylla is the dominant macrophyte in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, Portugal (40380N, 8430W), which is a highly urbanized estuary impacted by oyster cultivation and finfish aquaculture. This study aimed to understand the success of G. vermiculophylla in estuaries by monitoring its abundance and phenology throughout an annual cycle. This species thrives in soft-bottom communities, mostly entangled in the substrate amongst dead bivalve shells and tubes of the polychaete Diopatra neopolitana but it may be also found free-floating; it is present year-round. Carposporophytes were found throughout the year and at all sampling locations. The life history of this taxon was completed in the laboratory. Spore germination and growth success were investigated in a fully factorial designed array of temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25C), photoperiods (8, 12 and 16 h day-lengths) and photon flux densities (40 and 100 mmol photons m2 s1). Germination occurred under all conditions, being highest at 20C under the long day treatment. Germination was lowest at 5C, with no spore survival. The growth rates of the sporelings were affected by the interaction of the three factors tested. These were minimal at 10 C (2.21%  1.14 in 8-h days for tetrasporophytes and 2.60%  0.57 in 12-h days for gametophytes) and maximal at 20 C and long day treatments for both gametophyte and tetrasporophyte phases (9.96%  0.62 and 16.86%  0.73, respectively). No differences were found in the growth rates of the mature haploid or diploid phases. Gracilaria vermiculophylla is reproductive throughout the year. It attains high rates of germination and growth success under a wide range of environmental conditions. With such broad tolerances to environmental factors, G. vermiculophylla has a high invasive potential, which helps to explain its current dominance in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon.
