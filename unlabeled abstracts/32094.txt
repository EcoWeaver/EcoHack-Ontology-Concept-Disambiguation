The role played by citizen scientists in monitoring marine alien species in Greece
Environmental issues are best handled with the participation of all concerned citizens at the relevant level. Engaging citizen scientists to survey local biota and detect non-native marine species incursions is expected to result in the collection of significant data sets, which could potentially be used for an early-warning system inter alia. Our results suggest that such citizen support is beginning to develop in Greece, for invasive species such as the pufferfish Lagocephalus sceleratus; local newspapers often run a frontpage headline on the subject. Approximately 86 observations of 28 alien species (validated by taxonomic experts) were reported in 2012. Special mention is given to the following species, which until now had a very restricted distribution: Atherinomorus forskalii, Callionymus filamentosus, Smaragdia souverbiana and Cylichnina girardi. Concerned and informed citizens can participate personally in identifying incipient invaders and preventing them from spreading.
