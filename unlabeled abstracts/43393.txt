Scale dependency in native-exotic richness relationships revisited
In their seminal paper, Shea and Chesson (Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 2002, 17, 170) developed a highly cited model (S&C model) showing scale dependency in the native-exotic richness relationships. Two decades later, extensive additional data have been accumulated, leading to new findings and insights. Accordingly, two updates were made here to the original S&C model: (1) changing the "negative" richness relationship between natives and exotics to "non-consistent" or "non-significant"; and (2) modifying the original diagram to correctly represent native and exotic species richness and their correlations across both small and large scales.
