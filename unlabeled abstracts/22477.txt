Which stem parts of Slender speedwell (Veronica filiformis) are the most successful in plant regeneration?
Regeneration of Slender speedwell (Veronica filiformis) from small parts of stem without using stimulative agents was the focus of the investigation. Four different short fragments of shoot (main terminal, secondary terminal, nodal segment and internodal segment) were cultivated under greenhouse and natural conditions. All tested vegetative segments induced roots, rooted in a soil substrate and in a semi-natural lawn, survived winter, and flowered. Multiplication of clonal plants was confirmed for both the main and secondary terminal segments. These terminal segments had the best response in number of growing individuals, flowering stems, and weight of dried biomass. The manipulative experiment revealed that clonal success of speedwell is connected with possibilities to hive off of all tested above-ground segments. Establishment of plantlets from the segment in natural condition was not successful when accompanied by certain grass species.
