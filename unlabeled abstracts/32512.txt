Seasonal Distribution and Movement of the Invasive Pest Delottococcus aberiae (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) Within Citrus Tree: Implications for Its Integrated Management
Delottococcus aberiae (De Lotto) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is the most recent species of mealybug introduced to Spain that is affecting citrus. The feeding behavior of D. aberiae causes severe direct damage to citrus fruits, distorting their shape and/or causing reduction in size. There is no information available regarding its distribution within the citrus trees. The main objective of this study was to describe the seasonal distribution of D. aberiae within citrus trees and its migration patterns on the plants. Ten citrus orchards from eastern Spain were periodically sampled during 3 yr. In each orchard, the mealybug was sampled in different infested strata (canopy, trunk, and soil) and canopy structures (flower, fruit, leaf, and twig). Results showed that, within the sampled strata, D. aberiae was mostly in the canopy. Within the canopy, the feeding location of D. aberiae changed throughout the year. D. aberiae overwintered in the twigs and moved to the flowers and fruits in spring. Once there, its populations started to increase exponentially until August. From February to September, 5-30% of the mealybugs migrated to the trunk and soil. These results will facilitate an early detection of the pest in the areas where it is spreading and improve sampling protocols and pesticide applications.
