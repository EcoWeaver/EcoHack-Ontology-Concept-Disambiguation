Chilo partellus(Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) a new invasive species in Israel
Chilo partellus, the spotted stem borer (SSB), is reported for the first time from the fields of sorghum and corn in Israel. Spotted stem borer larvae were first discovered in July 2010 on sorghum and corn plants in the Western Galilee. The new pest had spread all over northern Israel by the end of 2011. The identity of the new pest was confirmed using the morphology of the dissected male genitalia and its attraction to SSB sex pheromone.
