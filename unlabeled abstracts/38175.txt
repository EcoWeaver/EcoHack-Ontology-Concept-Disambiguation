DNA barcoding as a useful tool for identifying non-native species of freshwater ichthyoplankton in the neotropics
The objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of DNA barcoding as a tool to identify non-native fish in their early stages of life. Specimens were collected from 14 sites in the lower and middle regions of the Paranapanema River--the main tributary of the Upper Parana River basin in southern Brazil. Over three reproductive periods from 2012 and 2015, 75 eggs and 170 larvae from 13 non-native fish species were identified. The most abundant species were Plagioscion squamosissimus (75 specimens) and Serrasalmus marginatus (68 specimens). The highest abundance was found near the Rosana hydroelectric plant reservoir. The removal of the natural physical barrier is the main reason that fish are introduced into the Paranapanema River basin with higher occurrence in the Rosana reservoir. P. squamosissimus was found in all reservoirs. DNA barcoding is a useful tool for identifying non-native fish during their reproductive phase. Furthermore, recording the presence of potentially invasive species in their early development stages may provide information useful for the rapid and effective control.
