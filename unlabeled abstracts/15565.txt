Current status of the non-indigenous molluscs in Chile, with the first record ofOtala punctata(Muller, 1774) (Gastropoda: Helicidae) in the country and new records forCornu aspersum(Muller, 1774) andDeroceras laeve(Muller, 1774)
A new introduced species, Otala punctata (Muller, 1774) and new records in Chile for Cornu aspersum (Muller, 1774) and Deroceras laeve (Muller, 1774) are documented based on surveys carried out in northern and central areas of the country. The presence and distribution of these alien species are complemented with a comprehensive compilation of all 34 non-indigenous species of marine, freshwater and terrestrial Mollusca in Chile; until 1999, only 16 alien species were known in Chile. Most of these alien species are found exclusively in transformed habitats, few exist in natural environments. The mechanism of introduction for the majority of these non-indigenous species is unknown; however, horticultural development, urban and suburban transformation of original natural habitats, and the aquarium trade are the most likely pathways of introduction. The highest threat of alien species is direct competition and predation of native molluscs, especially the small native land gastropods. Education and continuous field surveys are vital to detect and prevent their propagation as well as to avoid introduction of additional alien taxa.
