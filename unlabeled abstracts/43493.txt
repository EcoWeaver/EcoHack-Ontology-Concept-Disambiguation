Reinvasion of Native Invasive Trees After a Tree-Thinning Experiment in an African Savanna
Woody plant encroachment has serious negative consequences for ranchers because of the reduction in herbaceous fodder for domestic livestock. A long-term monitoring of a tree-thinning experiment was established near Magudu (northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) in 1990. The objective of this experiment was to determine the optimal tree density that would maximize grass production while benefiting grasses from nitrogen fixation, hydraulic lift, and/or shade from the leguminous trees. The initial dominant species was the nitrogen-fixing tree, Dichrostachys cinerea. There were 12 plots (6 pairs) with trees removed to approximate 0, 179, 277, 428, and 625 trees ha-1, with 1 pair left as a control (unmanipulated). One plot of each replicate (except the controls) was treated with short-acting herbicide (picloram) once in 1990. We collected data on herbaceous cover and species composition, tree species composition, sizes, and mortality. We also used remote sensing to examine the patterns of herbaceous cover. Herbaceous biomass decreased as tree density increased. After 30 yr, the same dominant tree species (D. cinerea) had reinvaded all the removal plots despite the fact that several encroaching species (Vachellia karroo, V. tortilis, V. nilotica) occurred in these plots. These D. cinerea trees were mostly less dense and contained many more juvenile individuals in the cleared and partially cleared plots than those in the control plots after 30 yr. Should maximizing herbaceous cover be the goal, repeated brush management would be necessary to maintain adequate control of woody plants in these savannas.
