Phenotypic and genomic characterization of vine cactus collection (Cactaceae)
Hylocereus (Berger) Britton et Rose, Selenicereus (Berger) Britton et Rose and Epiphyllum Haw. species have commercial potential as exotic fruit crops in semi-arid and arid lands. The high genetic variability among these species offers an opportunity for commercial cultivation. Toward this end we investigated genomic and morphological characteristics including: nuclear DNA content (2Cvalues), stomatal length and density, potential yield and reproductive parameters in 64 Hylocereus, Selenicereus and Epiphyllum accessions. Nuclear DNA content ranged from 3.21 pg for S. grandiflorus (L.) Britton et Rose spp. grandiflorus to 8.77 pg for H. megalanthus (Vaup.) Bauer. All species were diploid except the tetraploids H. megalanthus and S. vagans (Bgek.) Britton et Rose. Stomatal length and density, fruit weight, potential yields, number of viable seeds per fruit and fruit maturation times were highly variable among accessions. No significant correlations were found between stomatal length, density, and nuclear DNA content, nor between fruit weight and seed number. The high genetic variability found between the accessions here provides further support for the excellent prospects of conserving and domesticating these exotic species.
