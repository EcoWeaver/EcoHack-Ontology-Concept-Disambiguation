The Indo-Pacific oysterSpondylus spinosusSchreibers, 1793 in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea: reproductive features
Populations of the Indo-Pacific invasive bivalve Spondylus spinosus in the Eastern Mediterranean occur at high densities and occupy vast areas of the rocky habitats along the Israeli coast where they are cemented to hard substratum in an oyster-like fashion. We studied the reproductive features of this bivalve in part of the area where it has invaded and found it to be gonochoric, featuring a reproducing population with a sex ratio of 1:1, annual gonad development and an inferred spawning period coinciding with the seasonal rise in seawater temperature. It is suggested that these reproductive features support high fertilisation rates and fecundity, thus contributing to the maintenance of its populations in the new environment.
