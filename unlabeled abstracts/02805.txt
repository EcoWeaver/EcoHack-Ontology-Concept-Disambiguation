Scale-dependent impacts of invasive species: a reply to Chase et al. (2015)
Chase et al. [1] concluded that our criticism [2] of the universal scale-dependent impacts of invasive species on plant communities advocated by Powell et al. [3] was inappropriate because of confounding factors not accounted for in our analyses. Admittedly, our procedure was not the most powerful way to show what we wanted to stress: that there is a broad continuum of scale-dependent impacts and results of Powell et al. [3] are just one possible outcome facilitated by highly non-random sampling. The range of possible outcomes of plant invasions can be summarized in figure 1. Many, and perhaps most invasions will result in species-area curves (SAR) indistinguishable from SAR of uninvaded communities (a). This is because invaders' cover in most of the randomly sampled plots over all landscapes is very low [2]. As invaders' cover increases, first the intercept of SAR may decrease and its slope increase (b); and later, both intercept and slope may decrease (c). On the other hand, there may be also an increase of native species associated with plant invasion (d), but such cases are apparently very rare.
