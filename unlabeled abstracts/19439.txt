Influences of vegetation status on seedling survival of a river-endemic plant Aster kantoensis in the floodplain
To assess the vegetation status and substrate condition on seedling survival and flowery of an endangered plant species Aster kantoensis, I carried out an in situ seed-sowing experiment in the gravelly/sandy floodplain of the Kinu River, central Japan. The coverage of plant species, especially that of an alien species Eragrostis curvula, increased, and the subsequent reduction in the relative photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD) (%) after the large-scale flood in 1998 caused a decline in the percentage of seedling survival and flowery of A. kantoensis. Performances of A. kantoensis were compared under four types of seminatural conditions, i.e., combinations of existence or absence of E. curvula combined with gravelly or sandy substrates. The highest percentage of survival and flowery were observed on the gravelly substrate under the E. curvula,-free conditions, but values were low in areas invaded by E. curvula. Aggressive invasion of E. curvula was the principal cause of loss of safe sites for colonization of river-endemic plants.
