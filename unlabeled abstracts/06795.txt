Arthropod intermediate hosts of Abbreviata antarctica (Nematoda: Physalopteridae) in Australia
Abstract This novel research examines possible arthropod intermediate hosts for the nematode Abbreviata antarctica. Five species of arthropod (the tropical native cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus, native roach Drymoplaneta communis, native termite Nasutitermes exitiosus, and two introduced species, the east African roach Naupheta cinerea and the Asian cricket Acheta domesticus) were fed feces from a skink Tiliqua rugosa containing larvated eggs of Abbreviata antarctica. The insects were dissected at four intervals (one day, four days, 8-16 days and 25-26 days). Viable third-stage larvae were recovered from cysts on the external wall of the mid and hindgut of 62.5% nymph and adult Teleogryllus oceanicus crickets at 25-26 days post-infection, and from a single nymphal Acheta domesticus cricket. No roaches contained eggs or first-stage larvae after 48 hr, and neither eggs nor larvae were found in termites.
