Salt Marsh Claviceps purpurea in Native and Invaded Spartina Marshes in Northern California
The fungal pathogen Claviceps purpurea (subgroup G3) has a worldwide distribution on salt marsh Spartina spp. In Northern California (United States), native Spartina folioso sustains high rates of infection by G3 C. purpurea in marshes north of the San Francisco Estuary. Invasive populations of S. alterniflora and S. alterniflora x foliosa hybrids are virtually disease free in the same estuary, although S. alterniflora is host to G3 C. purpurea in its native range (Atlantic Coast of the United States). Greenhouse inoculation experiments showed no differences in susceptibility among S. foliosa, S. alterniflora, and Spartina hybrids. Under field conditions, S. foliosa sustained a higher incidence of disease in coastal marshes than in marshes within the bay. This geographic effect may be attributable to environmental differences between the coast and the bay proper, with the former being more conducive to infection by C. purpurea. Seed set of S. foliosa spikelets was 40 to 70% lower on infected than on uninfected inflorescences, but seed germination was not affected. The C. purpurea epidemic on S. foliosa on the coast north of the San Francisco Estuary further reduces the meager competitive ability of this declining native plant species.
