Biological Invasion in the Tropics
Perturbation in an ecosystem is an important prerequisite for successful invasion. Both frequency and intensity of perturbations are important. There are a few reports on invasion of intact ecosystems. Invasion may also occur in ecotonal zones under sub-optimal site conditions for the natives. A high reproductive effort, a wide ecological amplitude, differential responses to soil nutrients and to interspecific competition that would ensure coexistence, and allelopathic properties are important invasive strategies, which have ecosystem level consequences. Invasion impacts result in alteration in biomass, productivity and nutrient cycling patterns. Coping with biological invasion through an integrated management strategy should have utilization of the large biomass of the exotic species as the focal point, along with biological and chemical control measures for limited objectives. -from Author
