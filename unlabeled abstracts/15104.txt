Local soil, but not commercial AMF inoculum, increases native and non-native grass growth at a mine restoration site
Soil communities are often degraded in mined sites, and facilitating the recovery of soil mutualists such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) may assist with the restoration of native plants. At a grassland mine restoration site, I compared a commercial AMF inoculum with soil collected from beneath native grasses as a source of inoculum, as well as a control treatment. Field plots were broadcast-inoculated and seeded with native grasses, and biomass of native and non-native species was measured in three consecutive years. In addition, greenhouse-grown seedlings of a native bunchgrass (Stipa pulchra) were inoculated with similar treatments, transplanted into the field, and assessed after 18 months. When broadcast inoculation was used, the local soil inoculum tended to increase non-native grass biomass, and marginally decreased non-native forb biomass in the second year of study, but did not significantly affect native grass biomass. Broadcast commercial inoculum had no detectable effects on biomass of any plant group. Stipa pulchra transplants had greater N content and mycorrhizal colonization, and marginally higher shoot mass and K content, when pre-inoculated with local soil (relative to controls). Pre-inoculation with commercial AMF increased AMF colonization of the S. pulchra transplants, but did not significantly affect biomass or nutrient content. The findings indicate that at this site, the use of local soil as an inoculum had greater effects on native and non-native plants than the commercial product used. In order to substantially increase native grass performance, inoculation of transplanted plugs may be one potential strategy.
