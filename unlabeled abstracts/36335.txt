Northern Range Expansion and Invasion by the Common Carp, Cyprinus carpio, of the Churchill River System in Manitoba
Recent fisheries data from northern Manitoba indicates that the Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) has extended the northern limit of its range. Additionally, it also appears that carp have invaded and established viable populations in the Manitoba portion of the Churchill River. Habitat degradation and altered flow regimes as result of hydroelectric development in northern Manitoba may have facilitated the expansion of carp in the region.
