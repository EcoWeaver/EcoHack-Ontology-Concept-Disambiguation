Reproduction and early life history of an invasive ascidian Styela clava Herdman in Prince Edward Island, Canada
In the past decade, many aquatic invasive species have been introduced into Prince Edward Island, Canada, coastal waters, and they have had adverse effects on the aquaculture and fisheries industry. For instance, the mussel aquaculture industry has been overwhelmed by extremely high abundances of the invasive ascidian Styela clava in some areas. To understand and minimize the risk of spread of S. clava to other shellfish aquaculture sites, basic information on the reproductive biology of the ascidian is needed. This study investigated Styela gonad development, larval abundance and recruitment. Gonad development, using histological methods, indicated ovaries were ripe from late June through late October, 2004. Weekly water samples indicated larvae were present from 24 June to 29 October, with a distinct abundance peak in mid-August. Recruitment occurred from 24 June to 21 October. Timing of larval sampling was judged to be a crucial part of evaluating recruitment potential for monitoring purposes and a field experiment was carried out to document spatio-temporal larval concentrations. Data were gathered over 30 h sampling periods on 4 August and 14 September 2004. Water samples were taken simultaneously on an hourly basis at three depths: surface, 2 m and 4 m below the surface. Results indicated peaks in larval abundance were, in most cases, limited to a 3 h time interval in the early afternoon. Larval concentrations increased with water depth.
