Effects of cutting and sowing seeds of native species on giant ragweed invasion and plant diversity in a field experiment
AbstractBackgroundAmbrosia trifidais a highly invasive annual plant, but effective control methods have not been proposed. Among various eradication methods, cutting is a simple measure to control invasive plants, and sowing seeds of native plants may effectively increase biotic resistance to invasion. In this study, we conducted a field experiment with two treatments: cutting and sowing seeds of six native or naturalized plants.ResultsWe found a significantly lowerA. trifidaabundance after cutting than in the control (77% decrease). Sowing seeds of native species did not provide any additional benefit for the control ofA. trifida, but increased the importance values and diversity of other native vegetation. The abundance ofA. trifidawas negatively correlated with that of other plant taxa based on plant cover, biomass, and density. However, biotic resistance of sown plants was not effective to control invasion becauseA. trifidawas so competitive.ConclusionsWe concluded that cutting is an effective measure to controlAmbrosia trifidawhile sowing seeds of native plants can increase native plant diversity.
