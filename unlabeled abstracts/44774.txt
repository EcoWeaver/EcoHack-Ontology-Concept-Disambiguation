The nature of economic costs of biological invasions
The management of invasive alien species (IAS) is complex and requires consideration of intertwined ecological and economic dimensions. Given the wide variety of costing purposes and practices, and the associated risk of misunderstandings and/or miscommunication of their impacts which may jeopardize perceptions and management, there is an urgent need to disentangle the nature of IAS costs. We provide a synthesis of the nature and diversity of the economic costs associated with IAS and the potential limits of their assessment. This work promotes a common understanding of costs of IAS across disciplines, which is essential for improving the estimation, interpretation, selection, and uptake of costs when designing IAS management policies or raising societal awareness of their threats. By conceptualizing the monetary costs of IAS in a broader framework of economic costs, we highlight their complementarity with non-monetary costs when assessing the impacts of IAS on humans and biodiversity. Our study provides a novel, clear understanding of the nature of costs which should serve as a basis for sound decision and policy making.
