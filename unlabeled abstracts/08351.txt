Northward invasion of the parasitic deer ked (Lipoptena cervi), is there geographical variation in pupal size and development duration?
SUMMARYThe deer ked (Lipoptena cervi) is a common ectoparasite of cervids. During the last decades the species has rapidly invaded in northern Europe, especially in Finland, towards the north and increased its prevalence on the moose population. Consequently, during this rapid invasion the deer ked has faced more severe climatic conditions. We studied whether pupal size (measured as pupal weight) and pupal development duration of the deer ked varies along historical invasion zones and temperature zones towards north in Finland. Moreover, we explored possible size- and gender-dependent variation in pupal development duration. We divided wild-collected pupae in respect to their origin in two ways: (1) temperature zones (from south-west to colder north-east) and (2) invasion history (from early to late establishment). We reared pupae in the controlled laboratory conditions in identical temperature and light conditions. Pupal size decreased towards north and the smaller pupae developed faster. However, the results do not show differences in pupal size or developmental characteristics between the invasion zones. This supports the idea of rapid developmental plasticity of the deer ked and that not the invasion history but the current temperature regime determines the life history of the deer ked when invading towards a colder environment.
