Spatial and Temporal Variation in Guild Structure: Parasitoids and Inquilines of Andricus quercuscalicis (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) in Its Native and Alien Ranges
The communities associated with the invading gall wasp Andricus quercuscalicis vary considerably in species richness and species composition throughout its native and invaded ranges. Seventeen species of inquilines and parasitoids were identified as coinhabitants of the agamic galls of Andricus quercuscalicis throughout Europe. The life-histories of the parasitoid species are described; one is a solitary endoparasitoid, one a gregarious endoparasitoid and the remainder are solitary ectoparasitoids. A tortricid moth which develops as an inquiline in the agamic galls of A. quercuscalicis kills the gall causer; this is the first description of such an interaction between moths and cynipids. While some parasitoid species appear to be restricted in their attack to the native range of A. quercuscalicis, others were found throughout the range. Geographic variation in the species composition and the possible role of the invasion history of the host are discussed. Food web parameters calculated for the community from the native range and six regions across the invaded range appear to be correlated with the residence time of the invading host, in accordance with studies of successional communities. However, it might be impossible to separate effects of time from those of species richness.
