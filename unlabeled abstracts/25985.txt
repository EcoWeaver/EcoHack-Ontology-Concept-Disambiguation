Pollen morphology of Hosta Tratt. in China and its taxonomic significance
In this study, pollen morphology of 11 taxa of Hosta in China, three Chinese species, five introduced species, and three cultivars, was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and compared with that of related genera (Hemerocallis, Agave, and Yucca). Pollen grains of Hosta were long-ellipsoidal or ellipsoidal, 20-65x52.5-142.5mm in size, bilaterally symmetrical, and monosulcate on the distal face. Reticulate and rugulate exine ornamentation was observed in different taxa, and the rugulate type can be further divided into rugulate, rugulate-baculate, and rugulate-granulate subtypes. The exine ornamentation may have evolved in the order: reticulate-rugulate-rugulate-baculate-rugulate-granulate. Furthermore, the rugulate exine ornamentation was the predominant ornamental type in Hosta except for one species with the reticulate type; this is markedly different from that of Hemerocallis, Agave and Yucca. Thus, our data support the proposal by Dahlgren and Clifford (The Monocotyledons: a comparative study. Academic Press, London, 1982) that these Hosta species constitute an independent family-Hostaceae. KeywordsPollen morphology- Hosta Tratt.-Exine ornamentation-Taxonomic significance
