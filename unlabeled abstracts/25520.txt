Plant community attributes 12 to 14 years following precommercial thinning in a young lodgepole pine forest
We investigated plant community responses (abundance, species diversity, and structural diversity) to a range of precommercial thinning densities in young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) stands 12 to 14 years after thinning, with both unthinned and old-growth stands for comparison. Abundance of understory plants, especially herbs, appeared to increase dramatically in the thinned stands. The moss layer was significantly more abundant in old-growth stands than in the young pine stands. Of a total of 108 species sampled, only three were introduced species, all of which occurred more frequently in the low-density stands than in any of the other stands. Thinning treatments appeared to increase the abundance of late-seral species. Our results suggest that by disrupting canopy closure, thinning decreased the dominance of tall trees and increased the abundance of herbs, shrubs, and trees in the understory height classes. As a result, thinning to low densities significantly increased the structural richness of the tree layer and caused an increase in total structural diversity, which, although only marginally significant (p = 0.06), was likely biologically important. Our results suggest that thinning will enhance the abundance, species diversity, and structural diversity of the plant community 12 to 14 years postthinning.
