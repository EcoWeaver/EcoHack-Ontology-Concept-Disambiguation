Isolation and characterization of microsatellite loci in the avocado thrips Scirtothrips perseae (Thysanoptera: Thripidae)
The recent invasion of California by avocado thrips, Scirtothrips perseae, has had a serious economic impact on the Californian avocado industry. Here we report the isolation and characterization of six microsatellite loci for S. perseae, four of which were highly polymorphic (number of observed alleles ranged from three to 13 and expected heterozygosity from 0.31 to 0.87). These markers will be used to investigate the invasion history and route of entry into California of S. perseae. Three of the six loci successfully amplified in other Scirtothrips and Neohydatothrips species.
