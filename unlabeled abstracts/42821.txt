Invasive species in the biocenosis of the cooling reservoir of Belovskaya power plant (Southwest Siberia)
The invasion of species unusual to the biocenoses of the southern part of West Siberia was caused by a constant long-term input of discharge water from the Belovskaya thermal power plant. Crustaceans (Gmelinoides fasciatus Steb.), mollusks (Pomacea canaliculata Lamarck), and macrophytes (Vallisneria spiralis L.) were found in the areas of the heated water discharge. These species presumably entered the cooling reservoir from aquariums, and their distribution was limited to the areas of maximal and moderate water heating.
