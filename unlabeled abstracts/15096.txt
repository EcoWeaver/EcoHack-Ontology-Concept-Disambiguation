Impacts of Soil Nitrogen and Carbon Additions on Forest Understory Communities with a Long Nitrogen Deposition History
Rates of nitrogen (N) deposition have been historically high throughout much of the northeastern United States; thus, understanding the legacy of these high N loads is important for maintaining forest productivity and resilience. Though many studies have documented plant invasions due to N deposition and associated impacts on ecosystems, less is known about whether invasive plants will continue to increase in dominance with further shifting nutrient regimes. Using soil N and carbon additions, we examined the impact of both increasing and decreasing soil N on native and invasive understory plant dynamics over 4 years in a northeastern deciduous forest with a long history of N deposition. Despite applying large quantities of N, we found no difference in soil nitrate (NO3) or ammonium (NH4+) pools in N addition plots over the course of the study. Indicative of the potential N saturation in these forest soils, resin-available NO3- and NH4+ showed evidence that the added N was rapidly moving out of the soil in N addition plots. Accordingly, we also found that adding N to soil altered neither invasive nor native plant abundance, though adding N temporally increased invasive plant richness. Carbon additions decreased soil N availability seasonally, but did not alter the total percent cover of invasive or native plants. Rather than being suppressed by excess N availability, native plant species in this ecosystem are primarily inhibited by the invasive species, which now dominate this site. In conclusion, understory plant communities in this potentially N-saturated ecosystem may be buffered to future alterations in N availability.
