Ability of Megacopta cribraria (Hemiptera: Plataspidae) to Cling to Different Surfaces against Extreme Wind
The kudzu bug, Megacopta cribraria (Fabricius), is native to Asia but recently invaded the US and is expanding its distribution rapidly. To assess the probability of this bug traveling by attaching to the exteriors of fast-moving vehicles, we investigated the ability of M. cribraria adults to cling to stages with different surfaces (cloth, metal, or glass) against extreme airflows in a transparent acrylic tube connected to a vacuum cleaner. On the stages with cloth and metal, insects remained on the stages at 100 km/h wind speed. Estimated wind velocities required to blow 50 % of insects from the stages within 1 min were more than 100 km/h (cloth); 60 km/h (metal); and 40 km/h (glass) for males and 100 km/h (cloth); 50 km/h (metal); and 30 km/h (glass) for females. Together with frequent observations of attached M. cribraria on vehicle exteriors in the field, our results indicate a fairly high probability of range expansion of this species by attachment to vehicles.
