Ecology of North American Triatominae.
In all, 40 native triatomine species and subspecies occur in NA, belonging to six genera from the Triatomini (Triatoma, Paratriatoma, Panstrongylus, Dipetalogaster, Belminus, Eratyrus), and one genus from the Rhodniini (represented by one non-native species Rhodnius prolixus, formerly occurring exclusively in domestic habitats); 28 species are found exclusively in Mexico (and/or Central America), eight are shared between the United States (US) and Mexico, and four occur exclusively in the US. The genus Triatoma is the most diverse with 26 species belonging to the species groups protracta, including the species complexes protracta and lecticularia, and rubrofasciata, which includes the species complexes rubida, phyllosoma and dimidiata. Triatomine species richness declined both at higher (south US) and lower (south of the Istmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico) latitudes. Triatoma species are found predominantly in cropland, grassland, wooded grassland and woodland landscapes. Land cover types were most similar among the lecticularia, protracta, and rubida complexes, in contrast to the phyllosoma and dimidiata species complexes. The land cover types having highest suitability for most species were wooded grassland, followed by woodland for the phyllosoma and dimidiata species complexes, and open and closed shrubland and cropland for the remaining three species complexes. A principal component analysis was used to demonstrate differences in the potential range for use of environmental conditions: protracta and phyllosoma complexes occupy the broadest niches. The present study represents a primary stratification of potential triatomine dispersal areas, based on species and species complexes, and based on predicted niche, a method which has already proven to be highly significant epidemiologically.
