Necropsies of Reptiles: Recommendations and Techniques for Examining Invasive Species
Captures and postmortem examinations, or necropsies, of invasive or nonnative animals may provide insight into the ecological impact of these invaders. Researchers should be able to perform necropsies when an opportunity arises to examine nonnative species for study. While the techniques described serve as a guide to necropsy of all reptiles, we focus on exotic species found in south Florida. South Florida provides prime habitat for invasive reptiles such as Argentine black and white tegu and Burmese python, and these species are used to describe our techniques.
