The colonization by the tsetse, Glossina Pallidipes Austen, of a unique habitat--exotic coniferous plantation--with special reference to the Lambwe Valley, kenya
In West and Central Africa attention has recently been drawn to the role of commercial crop plantations in the creation of new tsetse habitat, and the problems this poses to trypanosomiasis control. Reported here is the colonization by the tsetse, Glossina pallidipes Austen, of a plantation of a very different kind--exotic coniferous forest. This has been observed in two localities in Kenya: the Lambwe Valley in the west, and the Shimba Hills near the coast. The features of this habitat, and the factors associated with its exploitation by tsetse, are described, with particular reference to the Lambwe Valley situation. While extension of tsetse fly-belts by afforestation practise is unlikely to be a problem of widespread significance in Kenya, afforestation policy ought, in particular circumstances, to take into account the tsetse and trypanosomiasis situation, the Lambwe Valley being a case in point.
