Reproductive biology of the introduced mayan cichlid, cichlasoma urophthalmus, within an estuarine mangrove habitat of Southern Florida
We investigated the reproductive biology of the Mayan cichlid, Cichlasoma urophthalmus, for twenty consecutive months in a southern Florida mangrove creek and compared it to that of available published accounts where this species is native. Mayan cichlid reproduction occurred during a period of the year when physical conditions facilitated the best growth and survival of the young, and was influenced more by changes in water level and salinity than by temperature. Most nests were observed along mangrove shorelines in April. The majority of reproduction and parental care of the young followed in May, and was completed by June when rising water levels flooded shallow habitats and dispersed young-of-year fish. Mayan cichlids in Florida became reproductively mature at a greater size than in native regions, but produced roughly the same number of eggs at a given body mass. The similarity of environmental conditions between southern Florida and areas where Mayan cichlids naturally occur imparts a very favorable reproductive potential for this species in southern Florida, and facilitates their continued presence within the ichthyofauna of the region.
