Effects of Environmental Heterogeneity and Disturbance on the Native and Non-native Flora of Desert Springs
Vegetation often is used as a decision variable for conservation and resource management. Because time and money are limited, it is useful to identify predictable relationships between measures of vegetation diversity or status, the physical environment, and disturbance; native and non-native plants may have different functional responses. Working towards development of effective, practical strategies for management and ecological restoration in the Spring Mountains, an isolated mountain range in the eastern Mojave Desert (Nevada, USA) that is a focus of regional conservation planning, we examined whether native and non-native assemblages of spring-associated perennial plants have predictable relationships with elevation, springbrook length, and various land uses. We also tested whether elevation, springbrook length, and overall disturbance were associated with the degree of predictability of local species presence and absence. Consistent with work in other systems, species richness and cover of native plants tended to decrease as intensity of disturbance increased, whereas species richness (but not cover) of non-native plants tended to peak with intermediate disturbance. Our results may suggest that invasions of non-native plants at springs in the Spring Mountains are relatively recent, and that rapid restoration and management actions may help protect ecological processes and viability of native plants. Ability to predict the order in which individual species are likely to be extirpated from or colonize springs was limited, perhaps reflecting considerable environmental heterogeneity among springs.
