The introduced Oreochromis niloticus is spreading on the Kaufe floodplain, Zambia
The Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, escaped from a fish farm in Mazabuka, probably in 1987, and was found in September 1992 on a 75 km stretch of the river, mainly downstream from the site of release. In most areas, except near Mazabuka, O. niloticus was relatively uncommon and so far does not seem to have hybridized with the local tilapias.
