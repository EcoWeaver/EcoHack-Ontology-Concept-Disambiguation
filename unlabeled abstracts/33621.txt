Eurythermic Sprint and Immune Thermal Performance and Ecology of an Exotic Lizard at Its Northern Invasion Front
Thermal performance of immunity has been relatively understudied in ectotherms, especially in the context of invasive species or in relation to other fitness-related traits and thermoregulatory patterns in the field. For reptiles, thermal biology is a primary factor determining physiological performance and population viability, and suboptimal thermal conditions may limit the expansion of exotic species along the edges of their invasion fronts. This study examined thermoregulatory ecology and thermal performance of immunity and sprinting in a population of Mediterranean geckos (Hemidactylus turcicus) at the northern edge of their invasion front in a temperate zone of the United States. In the field, we quantified temperatures of geckos of varied age classes in relation to air, wall, and refugia temperatures. We also quantified temperature-dependent sprint performance and immune function in field-collected geckos to detail thermal performance patterns that may contribute to the capacity for this species to invade cool climates. Although body temperature (Tb) of wild-caught geckos correlated with wall temperature, average Tb exhibited wide distributions, suggesting eurythermy. Furthermore, the thermal performance of immune swelling responses to phytohemagglutinin injections and sprinting was optimized over a similarly wide temperature range that overlapped with the field Tb's that suggest eurythermy in this species. The wide thermal performance breadths in these traits could buffer against variation in factors such as pathogen exposure and environmental temperatures that could otherwise suppress functional performance. Thus, eurythermy of sprint and immune performance may facilitate the invasive potential of H. turcicus.
