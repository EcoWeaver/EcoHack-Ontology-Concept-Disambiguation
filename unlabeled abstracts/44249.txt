New records in the alien flora of Romania (Artemisia argyi, A. lavandulaefolia) and Europe (A. lancea)
New records in the alien fl ora of Romania (Artemisia argyi, A. lavandulaefolia) and Europe (A. lancea) Abstract: Artemisia lancea Vaniot, A. argyi H.Lev. & Vaniot, and A. lavandulaefolia DC., all native from eastern Asia, are reported as new alien taxa from Romania. A. lancea has not been recorded so far in Europe, while A. argyi and A. lavandulaefolia are naturalised in the European part of the former USSR. All 3 species were collected in the Socola railway yard in northeastern Romania; the specimens were deposited in the IASI Herbarium, at the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Iasi. Th eir introduction was accidental, through the rail transport from the former USSR. Th e 3 species are perennial herbs, with white, glandular punctate leaves. All of them spread clonally, by stoloniferous rhizomes; A. argyi and A. lavandulaefolia produce fertile seeds, but only barren seeds were found in A. lancea, perhaps due to fertilisation failure. Th ey grow on disturbed ground associated with railways, together with other ruderal species, most of them characteristic to the class Artemisietea vulgaris. Th e description and distribution of the species, as well as some data related to their taxonomy, biology (including seed germination and chromosome numbers), ecology (habitats, plant communities), and general uses, are given in this paper. An identifi cation key for these species and other 2 related taxa is provided.
