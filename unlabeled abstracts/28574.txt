Mapping Fire Risk in Mediterranean Ecosystems of California: Vegetation type, Density, Invasive Species, and Fire Frequency
California ecosystems and climate have characteristics that promote to wildfire, particularly in the dry late summer and fall seasons. Over recent decades, fire severity and number of fires has increased. In many cases, the changing fire regimes have been concurrent with the spread of invasive annual grasses into shrub and woodland habitats that provide dry fuel in the late summer/fall season. Remote sensing data, especially high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral data has contributed to better mapping of vegetation types and characteristics and assessment of the biophysical condition of the vegetation, mostly related to drought status. These data can provide inputs to improved wildfire risk models. The temporal 1-day and 8-day resolution of the weather satellites contributes information on vegetation dynamics, particularly MODIS, which provides spatially distributed changes in canopy water content as the vegetation in these fire prone ecosystems dries and fire risk increases. Lastly, we describe a new multitemporal classifier to monitor early detection of near real-time fire ignitions using the half-hourly geostationary satellite.
