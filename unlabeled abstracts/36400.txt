'One is the loneliest number'; are we witnessing the death throes of the single-author research paper in the field of biological invasions?
Single-author papers are the lowest relative contributors to the research output of international open access journals BioInvasions Records (BIR), Aquatic Invasions (AI) and Management of Biological Invasions (MBI), accounting for 5% or less of published papers. In contrast, papers by four or more authors are the highest contributors, accounting for over half of the research output for the three journals. Papers by two or three authors are intermediate between these extremes, accounting for 15-23% of research ouputs. The relative contributions of research papers by single-authors to the output of AI and MBI has also significantly declined over time, while concurrently those by four or more authors has significantly increased. Although not significant, a similar pattern is also evident in BIR. Considering invasion ecology research, factors such as increasing globalisation, the increasing use of transboundary data-sets for invasive species and the proliferation of collaborative multidisciplinary author teams with multiple skill-sets, may be driving single-author papers to extinction.
