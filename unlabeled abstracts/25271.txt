The Harlequin ladybird continues to invade southeastern Europe
The ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) is considered one of the most serious invasive species around the globe. It has spread all over North America and Western Europe, while data from southeastern Europe, especially in the Mediterranean region, are scarce. In this study we present the first confirmed data of the spread of H. axyridis throughout Croatia. Specimens were sampled and identified during the period 2008-2010. The species was recorded at 18 localities in all three colour forms in various habitat types. Light trapping was found to be a satisfactory method for collecting H. axyridis. Since there is no evidence to suggest the deliberate introduction of H. axyridis in Croatia, it can be assumed that it has spread southwards from Central and Eastern Europe, and that it will probably continue to spread. Further investigations should focus on monitoring and detailed mapping of H. axyridis in Croatia and neighbouring countries, especially in the Mediterranean region, to determine whether stable populations are present.
