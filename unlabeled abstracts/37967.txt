Consequences of introducing the invasive amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus into large shallow Lake Peipsi: present distribution and possible effects on fish food
The objective of the study was to assess the effect of the Baikalian amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus, a successful invader into Europe, as a fish food source in Lake Peipsi to where it was introduced in the 1970s. In 2002-2006, the littoral macrozoobenthos was studied along 17 transects (0.1-4 m depth, 384 quantitative samples) to determine the recent distribution of G. fasciatus and its share in the benthic community. Earlier records on the littoral macrozoobenthos from the years 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000 were also used for comparison. Our results indicate that the invasive G. fasciatus is the dominant species (about 43% of total macrozoobenthos abundance) in the littoral zone of Lake Peipsi, while the native gammarids Gammarus lacustris and Pallasea quadrispinosa appear to be extinct and oligochaetes seem to have declined. G. fasciatus preferred hard substrates and it was mainly distributed close to water shallow beach areas (water depth <0.2 m), where its abundance reached locally up to 29 000 ind. m-2 (97% of total macrozoobenthos abundance). This distribution pattern of the invader in summer makes it mostly inaccessible for adult fish and increases its survival rate. Being highly mobile, G. fasciatus is not sensitive to water level fluctuations in shallow lakes. These behavioural characteristic increase its population success.
