Recent moon jelly (Aurelia sp.1) blooms in Korean coastal waters suggest global expansion: examples inferred from mitochondrial COI and nuclear ITS-5.8S rDNA sequences. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 443-452. The moon jelly Aurelia was found recently in Korean coastal environments, and its dense blooms caused economic losses for fisheries and power plants. The species is tentatively recognized as Aurelia aurita; yet, its identity and origin remain elusive. To find reliable molecular evidence for its identity, we determined the DNA sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene and nuclear ITS-5.8S rDNA of specimens collected from different Korean locations. We compared the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA data among specimens and demonstrated that all Korean Aurelia have an identical genotype. BLAST searches demonstrated that the Korean Aurelia matched the previously designated Aurelia sp.1. Parsimony and relevant phylogenetic analyses of the genus Aurelia demonstrated that the genotypes of Korean, Japanese, and Californian Aurelia sp.1 were nearly identical (>99.6% similarity), whereas they were significantly different (<84.1% similarity) from other Aurelia. This suggests that Aurelia sp.1, which occur in the three regions, are descendants of a single population and may have dispersed from one location. However, the dispersal time and origin of Aurelia sp.1 still remain uncertain.
