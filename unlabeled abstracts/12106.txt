Changes in water quality variables at a mid-depth site after proliferation of dreissenid mussels in southeastern Lake Michigan
Studies evaluating the impacts of dreissenid mussels in Lake Michigan have largely focused on changes in phytoplankton dynamics in the offshore region (i.e., > 100 m depth) even though mussel biomass is actually highest in mid-depth coastal regions of Lake Michigan (i.e., 30-50 m). Here we report on changes at the base of the food web during 1995-2014 at a mid-depth site located in southeastern Lake Michigan. Specifically, we evaluated trends in Secchi depth, surface mixed layer chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus (TP), sub-epilimnetic deep chlorophyll layer concentrations, and near bottom chlorophyll-a concentrations and whether there have been shifts in the seasonal patterns of these variables. Median chlorophyll-a concentrations declined over 63 % during the spring isothermal period following the sharp increase in mussel abundance between 1996-2002 and 2007-2014. Chlorophyll-a concentrations in the spring were generally between 2 and 3 mg m-3 in 1996-2002, but almost never exceeded 1 mg m-3 in 2007-2014. Secchi depths increased in all months between 1996-2002 and 2007-2014, with the greatest changes being observed in the spring. Total phosphorus in the surface mixed layer declined over the study period, but not at as fast a rate as chlorophyll-a, a change consistent with mussel invasions. There was a 90 % decline in the median depth integrated deep chlorophyll-a concentration between 1995-2000 and 2007-2014 in June when this feature was at its peak. Chlorophyll-a concentrations in the near bottom zone also decreased over time, likely due to their constant contact with dreissenid mussels. The declines in chlorophyll-a and changes in nutrient dynamics at the mid-depth site are consistent with dreissenid induced impacts that have also been documented at deeper, offshore sites in Lake Michigan.
