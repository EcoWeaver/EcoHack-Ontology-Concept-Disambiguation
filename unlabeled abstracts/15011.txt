Genetic structure and unique origin of the introduced blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in the north-western Pacific: clues from mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) sequences
As an introduced species, the Mediterranean blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is widely distributed in the north-western Pacific. However, the mussel's introduction pathway, colonisation route and source of introduction are unclear. In the present study, genetic variation among 11 colonised populations of M. galloprovincialis in the northwestern Pacific was analysed using fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) detected no significant differences at any hierarchical level, and all fixation index (FST) values were non-significant, reflecting a founder event and potential high dispersal ability. Phylogenetic analysis showed that populations of M. galloprovincialis in the north-western Pacific were introduced from the middle Mediterranean Sea and that the Dalian population was the first colonised population in the coastal waters of China. By assessing the origin of introduced populations of M. galloprovincialis, the present study provides new insights into the biogeography of M. galloprovincialis. Journal compilation.
