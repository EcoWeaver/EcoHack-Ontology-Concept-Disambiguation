Site-based and remote sensing methods for monitoring indicators of vegetation condition: An Australian review
Native vegetation around the world is under threat from historical and ongoing clearance, overgrazing, invasive species, increasing soil and water salinity, altered fire regimes, poor land management and other factors, resulting in a degradation of natural ecosystem services. Consequently, maintaining and improving native vegetation condition is a target frequently adopted by natural resource managers and government agencies world-wide. Adequate monitoring of vegetation condition remains a prerequisite for environmental decision-making and for tracking progress towards management goals. Throughout we consider vegetation condition to include the compositional, structural and functional attributes of vegetation relative to undisturbed vegetation of the same type.
