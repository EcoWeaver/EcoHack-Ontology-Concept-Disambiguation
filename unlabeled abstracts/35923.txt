Do vegetal communities dominated by invasive exotic plant species affect the structure of bird communities in an Atlantic Forest area?
Invasive exotic plants can modify the structure of the environment, producing a cascade of effects on different animal populations, such as birds, which tend to decrease in quantity and diversity of species. The objective of this study was to evaluate how the bird assemblage responds to an invasion by exotic species of plants in an Atlantic Forest area in northeastern Brazil. Data were collected on the richness, abundance, frequency of occurrence, trophic groups, dependence on forest habitats, and conservation status of bird species in two forest areas: one with no invasive plant species and one with a predominance of invasive plant species, mainly trees. The results showed that the presence of invasive exotic vegetation influenced the bird assemblage, and in the area where the invasive exotic species were predominant, the richness and abundance of birds were significantly lower than in the area with natural vegetation. In addition, the composition of the bird assemblage was significantly different in areas where exotic plant species prevailed, with no species dependent on forest habitats or threatened with extinction. We concluded that the habitat dominated by invasive exotic plants modified the local bird assemblage. Thus, the control and management of alien plant species must be undertaken.
