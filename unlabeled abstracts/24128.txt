Does herbicide weed control increase livestock production on non-equilibrium rangeland?
Herbicides have been applied extensively on rangelands to reduce forbs that were considered undesirable, which has been assumed to lead to an increase in grass production and ultimately to an improvement in livestock performance. While scores of research studies support the premise that forb suppression can increase desirable forage on plot-level studies, only a few studies have attempted to quantify the effect on livestock production within experimental units equivalent in area to production-scale pastures. We therefore tested the effect of herbicide on mixed prairie vegetation and on livestock gain on pastures typical in area, stocking rate, and composition to working ranches in the region. Picloram and 2,4-d at 0.15 and 0.56kg/ha, respectively, were applied aerially in spring of 2001 and again in spring of 2004 to two pastures. Two untreated control pastures were managed identically, including grazing management, but were not treated with herbicide. Canopy cover by species and cover of bare ground and litter were estimated in permanently located plots, and stocker cattle performance (average daily gain per head; ADG) and total cattle gain (kgha-1) were measured from 2000 to 2005. Forb cover was less (P
