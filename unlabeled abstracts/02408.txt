First European records of an alien paper wasp: Polistes (Aphanilopterus) major Palisot de Beauvois, 1818 (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) in northern Spain
The frequency and speed of the transport of goods and passengers have been on the increase for decades, involving a higher rate of introductions of animals and plants to new regions that they were not able to colonise unassisted. In particular, a large number of Hymenoptera have become introduced, either deliberately (for crop pollination purposes or pest control) or unintentionally. No global data are available, but a few regional examples may outline the size of the problem: 286 hymenopteran species are known to have been introduced into Europe (Rasplus et al. 2010), 148 into New Zealand (Landcare Research 2009), 35 into the Galapagos Islands (Causton et al. 2006) and 28 into the Canary Islands (Baez & Oromi 2010). The introduction of vespids has become relatively common worldwide: 33 species are known as introduced, with Hawaii (15 species) and North America (8) as the main host regions (Beggs et al. 2011). Although some vespids have been translocated from certain European countries to others (Rasplus et al. 2010), only one exotic vespid, Vespa velutina Lepeletier, is known to have become established in Europe (Beggs et al. 2011). The cosmopolitan genus Polistes Latreille is one of the most diverse among vespids (ca. 220 species: Carpenter 2008, updated). There are 10 native Polistes spp. in Europe, all in the nominotypical subgenus (Carpenter 1996a, updated), while no European records of exotic Polistinae have been published (Rasplus et al. 2010). Here we report the occurrence of a reproductively active population of the American paper wasp Polistes major major Palisot de Beauvois in northern Spain, constituting the first record of an introduced Polistes in Europe. Also, we present a diagnosis of P. major and discuss the potential pathways for introduction into Europe and the possible impacts that it may generate at its new location.
