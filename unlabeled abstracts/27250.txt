U.K. winter egg survival in the field and laboratory diapause ofTyphlodromips montdorensis
 Typhlodromips montdorensis has potential for release as a glasshouse biological control agent in the U.K. against thrips and spider mites. This study investigates the field survival in the U.K. of T. montdorensis when released as eggs, and the diapause response when reared in a regime related to its location of origin. All acclimated and nonacclimated eggs of T. montdorensis die in the field within 7 days of exposure. It is not possible to induce diapause in T. montdorensis reared at 21 degC under a LD 11 : 13 h photoperiod. The results presented here support the view that T. montdorensis is unlikely to survive a U.K. winter outside of the glasshouse environment, and contribute to the understanding of the biology of this little known species.
