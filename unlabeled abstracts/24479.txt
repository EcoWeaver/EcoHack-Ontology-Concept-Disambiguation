Spatial organisation and intra-specific relationship of the raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides in Central Europe
During October 1999 - October 2003, we monitored 26 adult raccoon dogs Nyctereutes procyonoides using radio-telemetry in an area of Germany which has been occupied by this invasive alien species since the early 1990s. No adult animals dispersed from the area during the study period and home ranges tended to be used for several years, probably for life. The average annual home-range size, calculated using 95% fixed kernel, was 382.2 ha+-297.4 SD for females (N=30 seasonal home ranges) and 352.4 ha+-313.3 for males (N=32 seasonal home ranges). Paired raccoon dogs had home ranges of similar size (P=0.203), with pairs sharing the same area all year round (P<0.001). Raccoon dogs occupied large core areas (85% kernel) covering 81.2% of their home ranges. The home ranges were at their smallest during the mating season. The slightly larger size of home ranges in winter suggests that, due to the temperate climate, raccoon dogs do not hibernate in Germany. Males and females formed a long-term (probably lifelong) pair bond. Same-sex neighbours ignored each other and even adjacent males/females showed neither preference nor avoidance. Thus, based on the results of home-range overlap analysis and interaction estimations, it can be assumed that the raccoon dog in Central Europe is monogamous without exclusive territories.
