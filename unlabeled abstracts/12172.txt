Nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities in invasive legume nodules and associated soils are similar across introduced and native range populations in Australia
Understanding the interactions between invasive legumes and soil biota in both native and introduced ranges could assist in managing biological invasions. We analysed the diversity of putative nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB, i.e. nifH gene present) associated with five invasive legumes, four Acacia spp. and a sister taxon Paraserianthes lophantha in introduced and native range populations in Australia. We predicted that, because these host species are widely distributed, they are likely to encounter different nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities in soils and nodules across their introduced and native ranges.
