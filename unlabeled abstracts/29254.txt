STATUS OF DIONDA DIABOLI AND REPORT OF ESTABLISHED POPULATIONS OF EXOTIC FISH SPECIES IN LOWER SAN FELIPE CREEK, VAL VERDE COUNTY, TEXAS
Sampling from April 2001 to March 2003 revealed San Felipe Creek, Val Verde Count) Texas, still supported a breeding population of the threatened Devils River minnow (Dionda diaboli). The species was restricted to creek habitats and was not found in the outflow channels of San Felipe Springs. We determined that breeding populations of introduced tropical fish species Hypostomus (a South American armored catfish) and Oreochromis aureus (an African cichlid) also were present in San Felipe Creek. We obtained evidence to suggest that presence of exotic species, particularly Hypostomus, might have a negative effect on the Devils River minnow. We recommend periodic monitoring of fish populations in San Felipe Creek to document future changes in the population of Devils River minnow and other endemic species, and to facilitate design and implementation of conservation plans in San Felipe Creek.
