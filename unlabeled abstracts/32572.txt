Trade-Offs in Cold Resistance at the Northern Range Edge of the Common Woodland Ant Aphaenogaster picea (Formicidae)
Geographic variation in low temperatures at poleward range margins of terrestrial species often mirrors population variation in cold resistance, suggesting that range boundaries may be set by evolutionary constraints on cold physiology. The northeastern woodland ant Aphaenogaster picea occurs up to approximately 45degN in central Maine. We combined presence/absence surveys with classification tree analysis to characterize its northern range limit and assayed two measures of cold resistance operating on different timescales to determine whether and how marginal populations adapt to environmental extremes. The range boundary of A. picea was predicted primarily by temperature, but low winter temperatures did not emerge as the primary correlate of species occurrence. Low summer temperatures and high seasonal variability predicted absence above the boundary, whereas high mean annual temperature (MAT) predicted presence in southern Maine. In contrast, assays of cold resistance across multiple sites were consistent with the hypothesis of local cold adaptation at the range edge: among populations, there was a 4-min reduction in chill coma recovery time across a 2deg reduction in MAT. Baseline resistance and capacity for additional plastic cold hardening shifted in opposite directions, with hardening capacity approaching zero at the coldest sites. This trade-off between baseline resistance and cold-hardening capacity suggests that populations at range edges may adapt to colder temperatures through genetic assimilation of plastic responses, potentially constraining further adaptation and range expansion.
