IMPLICATIONS OF INVASIVE SHRUB GORSE (ULEX EUROPAEUS L.) ERADICATION PROGRAMS IN HORTON PLAINS NATIONAL PARK, SRI LANKA: A CASE STUDY FROM A TROPICAL ISLAND
Alien invasive species are a significant threat to biodiversity and ecosystems in nonnative geographical ranges. Ulex europaeus is one such shrub introduced to the montane grasslands of Sri Lanka. We conducted this study with the objective of evaluating the U. europaeus removal programs focusing on both positive and negative impacts that arose. Three months of pre-removal and three months each of two post-removal time periods were selected for sampling. We evaluated the changes in the density of U. europaeus, Calotes nigrilabris, spatiotemporal variation of vegetative structure and pollinator abundance. Initially, the removal of U. europaeus was mostly successful in terms of reduced shrub density. However, the prevalence and emergence of live shrubs after the removal program raises concerns regarding the viability of the project. Furthermore, the drastic population density reduction of endemic and threatened lizard C. nigrilabris following the removal of U. europaeus can be considered a negative impact of high conservation concern. However, we observed an increase in pasture availability and re-establishment of natural vegetative structure. It can be concluded that proper knowledge regarding the invasive species and understanding their ecological linkages is important for the success of management programs. Continuous and long term, control and monitoring are recommended.
