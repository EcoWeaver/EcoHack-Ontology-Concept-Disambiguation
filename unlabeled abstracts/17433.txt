Factors associated with the success of native and nonnative species in an unfragmented arid-land riverscape
Native fish persistence is threatened by the establishment and spread of nonnatives. Identifying environmental and biotic factors associated with the success of co-occurring native fishes and nonnative taxa is central to identifying mechanisms responsible for native declines and nonnative expansion. We related physicochemical variables, food resources, and community composition to the success (secondary production) of native and nonnative fishes, tadpoles, and crayfish across six sites in three reaches (tributary, canyon, and valley) during 2008-2011 in the Gila River, New Mexico. Native fish success was greater than nonnative success across a range of physicochemical conditions, basal resource supply rates, and nonnative communities, although nonnative fish, tadpole, and crayfish success could approach or exceed that of native fishes in canyon habitats, a warm-water tributary, or in downstream valley sites, respectively. Native fish success was lowest in canyon reaches, when flathead catfish (Pylodictis olivaris) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were highly productive. These results demonstrate the potential for native fish persistence in the presence of nonnatives in physically unmodified streams, highlighting the importance of habitat preservation for native conservation.
