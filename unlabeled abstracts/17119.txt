Innovative snow harvesting technology increases vegetation establishment success in native sagebrush ecosystem restoration
Aims In cold-arid systems, moisture availability is often a limiting factor to vegetation establishment and growth. Consequentially, manipulating soil moisture dynamics may help to improve restoration practice. Application of snow fencing, for microclimate manipulation in cold-arid regions, improves native species establishment and restoration success following disturbance by improving soil moisture retention. Methods Research was conducted in the Jonah Natural Gas Field, an area subjected to intensive gas development, in southwest Wyoming, USA, to assess roles of snow fencing in altering snowpack characteristics, and soil moisture, for improving re-establishment of native vegetation. Results Application of a customized snow fence design (the Hollow Frame Fence System, HFFS) significantly increased vegetation establishment of the framework taxon, Artemisia tridentata Nutt. spp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young, and other native sagebrush-steppe species. The HFFS exhibited significantly fewer invasive species than control blocks; establishment of A. tridentata was significantly higher within the HFFS, as compared to both control blocks, and commercial fence types. Significant increases in spring soil moisture are likely drivers of increased restoration success with use of HFFS. Conclusions The Hollow Frame Fence System provides increased water harvesting capacity necessary to improve habitat restoration in cold-arid environments subjected to disturbance.
