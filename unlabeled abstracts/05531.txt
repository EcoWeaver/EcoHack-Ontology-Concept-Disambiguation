Biology, ecology and management of the invasive parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus L.).
Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus L.) is one of the most aggressive invasive weeds, threatening the natural and agro-ecosystems in over 30 countries worldwide. Parthenium weed inflicts losses to crops and pastures, degrading the biodiversity of natural plant communities, causing human and animal health hazards and seriously inflicting economic losses to people and their interests in many countries around the globe. Several of its biological and ecological attributes contribute towards its invasiveness. Various management approaches (viz. cultural, mechanical, chemical and biological control) have been used to minimize losses caused by this weed but most of these approaches are ineffective, uneconomical and/or have limitations. Although, chemical control using herbicides and biological control utilizing exotic insects and pathogens has been found to contribute to the management of the weed, nevertheless the weed remains a significant problem. An integrated management approach has been proposed here for the effective management of parthenium weed on a sustainable basis.
