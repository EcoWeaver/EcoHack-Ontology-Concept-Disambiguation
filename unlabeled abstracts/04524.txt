Land-use intensification effects on functional properties in tropical plant communities
There is consensus that plant biodiversity and ecosystem processes are negatively affected by land-use intensification (LUI), but at the same time there is empirical evidence that a large heterogeneity in the responses can be found. This heterogeneity is especially poorly understood in tropical ecosystems. We evaluated changes in community functional properties across five common land use types in the wet tropics with different land-use intensity: mature forest, logged forest, secondary forest, agricultural land, and pastureland, located in the lowlands of Bolivia. For the dominant plant species, we measured 12 functional response traits that are related to their life history, acquisition and conservation of resources, plant domestication and breeding. We used three single-trait metrics to describe community functional properties. Community abundance-weighted mean (CWM) traits values, coefficient of variation, and kurtosis of distribution. The CWM of all 12 traits clearly responded to LUI. Overall, we
