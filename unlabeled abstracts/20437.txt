Condition status and parasite infection of Neogobius kessleri and N. melanostomus (Gobiidae) in their native and non-native area of distribution of the Danube River
The success of introduced species is often facilitated by escape from the effects of natural predators and parasites. Introduced species can profit from this favourable situation, attaining higher population densities and greater individual sizes in novel areas. In this study, somatic condition and parasite infection were compared between native and non-native populations of Neogobius kessleri Gunther; introduced only within the interconnected Danube and Rhine River system, and N. melanostomus (Pallas); widely introduced throughout several river systems in Europe and North America. Higher values of Fulton's condition factor were observed in non-native populations of both goby species. Neogobius melanostomus attained higher gonadosomatic index values in non-native populations, indicating potential increased investment in reproduction in its new area. A lower splenosomatic index was observed in non-native populations, especially in N. melanostomus. Parasite infracommunity richness and mean abundance were higher in N. kessleri in both native and non-native populations, suggesting higher susceptibility of N. kessleri to these parasites. Non-native populations of both hosts showed higher infra-community richness as a result of acquiring parasites native to the new area, but lower parasite abundance. Differences in success of the introduction and establishment in new areas between the two fish species may be associated with a relatively low parasite infection rate and a higher gonadosomatic index in non-native populations of N. melanostomus in comparison to N. kessleri.
