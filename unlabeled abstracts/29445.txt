In search of an operational lexicon for biological invasions
I have presented here an optimistic view of the CM model and its potential as a unifying framework for both ecological theory and management practices. However, this model is only in an early stage of development, and there is still much work to be done. In particular, it is, I think, largely impossible to come up with a general scheme for the operationalization of invasion terminology. Instead, research is needed to develop specific criteria to apply the CM model to particular systems of study. It is likely that a number of unforeseen difficulties will become apparent during this process. Such problems can only be addressed as they arise, but I am confident that the CM model, as elaborated here, is an important first step in the elimination of ecological phlogiston and the operationalization of invasion concepts. I strongly believe that the use of a stage-based model as an integrative framework will help to unite the rift between invasion ecology and resource management to the benefit of both disciplines.
