Evidence of reproductive activity of the invasive common carp Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus, 1758) (Teleostei: Cyprinidae) in a subtropical coastal system in southern Brazil
The common carp Cyprinus carpio is an omnivorous, highly fertile fractional spawner and a generalist species that can live in a wide range of biotic and abiotic conditions. The combination of these features contributes to their high invasiveness potential allowing its rapid spread and increased biomass. The species has already established in 91 out of 120 countries where it has been introduced, especially due to aquaculture and ornamental activities. This work, based on the presence of C. carpio inhabiting the Patos-Mirim system, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, provides the first evidence of advanced stages of gonadal development in both sexes, reinforcing the view that the species can adapt to regional environmental conditions and suggests high potential for establishment of self-sustaining populations in this system.
