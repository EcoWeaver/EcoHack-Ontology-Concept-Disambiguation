Effects of salt marsh invasion by Spartina alterniflora on sulfate-reducing bacteria in the Yangtze River estuary, China
To investigate how plant invasion affects sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) responsible for sulfate reduction, we conducted a comparative study of diversity and composition of SRB in rhizosphere soils of invasive exotic species (Spartina alterniflora) and two native species (Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter) on Jiuduansha Island located in the Yangtze River estuary, China. Throughout the growing season, profiles of DGGE fingerprints of SRB had distinct variations in relation to phenological stages of these three plant species. The higher richness and abundance of SRB in the rhizospheres of native plants mainly occurred when the plants were in vegetative growth and reproductive stages. However, the higher richness and abundance of SRB also occurred in the late growing season (senescent stage) of S. alterniflora rhizosphere, during which Desulfobulbus, Desulfuromonas, Desulfovibrio, and Firmicutes were dominant. Our results adding to our previous studies suggested that abundant SRB in late stage might have close relationships with decomposition of soil organic matters produced by S. alterniflora.
