Phoma glomerata, a potential new threat to Italian inland waters
Non-indigenous crayfish species, carrier of the oomycete Aphanomyces astaci, are the most important threats to European crayfish species. However, other ectoparasite species have been reported to be the pathogen of aquatic organisms. As little is known about other potential pathogens carried by the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii, a total of 86 individuals of this species was collected in Lake Trasimeno from June 2007 to 2008. Phoma glomerata, never recorded in Italy, colonised more than 65% of the captured crayfish. No significant differences in prevalence were recorded between sexes, among life stages and between soft- and hard-shelled crayfish. This Coelomycetes is the causal agent of many diseases in plants, animals and humans. These results may contribute to a better understanding of the implications of epibiontic microfungi on the invasive crayfish P. clarkii, for both ecological and sanitary purposes.
