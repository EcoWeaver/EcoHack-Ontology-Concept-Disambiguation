Taxonomic Considerations of a Foliose Grateloupia Species from the Straits of Messina
Grateloupia turuturu Yamada is the currently accepted name for the invasive red alga that is present on coasts of the North Atlantic. Previously considered as G. doryphora (Montagne) M.A. Howe, populations of this invasive species were examined and their taxonomic position revised using molecular and morphological techniques. It was also thought that similar invasive populations in the Mediterranean should be identified as G. turuturu. This investigation used rbcL based molecular analyses to clarify the taxonomic position of Grateloupia "doryphora" from the Straits of Messina. Our results indicate that this population is neither G. doryphora nor G. turuturu. It was placed separately in all analyses and grouped consistently with other Grateloupia species from the Pacific. On the basis of molecular data from this and previous investigations, it is evident that the status of the foliose Atlantic and Mediterranean entities is still unclear and a re-evaluation of the old names connected to them should be undertaken.
