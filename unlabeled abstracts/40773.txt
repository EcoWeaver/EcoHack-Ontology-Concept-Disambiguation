Pyrolysis technology for Cortaderia selloana invasive species. Prospects in the biomass energy sector
Cortaderia selloana (CS), is an invasive and exotic species that is generating significant invasive problems in the Iberian Peninsula ecosystems. The objective of this research was to study this plant potential thorough a pyrolytic process helping to reduce its expansion. Stems and leaves were subjected to conventional and flash pyrolysis. These processes were carried out in an original design oven using a 25degC/min heating ramp at a 750degC temperature and during 60 min at the pyrolysis temperature for conventional pyrolysis and with 750degC and 850degC pyrolysis temperatures for flash. Gas-fraction obtained by flash pyrolysis had higher HHV data when compared with conventional ones (~~17 MJ/kg vs ~ ~5 MJ/kg) due to their less CO2 and higher CO, CH4 and H2. The greater bio-oil yield was obtained for CSS-P (33.58%). The composition of conventional pyrolysis bio-oils had an overbearing of nonaromatic and monoaromatic hydrocarbons nature whereas bio-oils from flash pyrolysis were composed mainly of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Bio-char fraction was higher in CSL than CSS with HHV similar to lignite and bituminous coals (22.74 to 29.12 MJ/kg). After done the quantification and characterization of the fractions, it was concluded that a possible energetic valorization of Cortaderia selloana biomass was possible.
