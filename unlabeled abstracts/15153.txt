Using management to determine drivers of alien plant invasion and limits to native restoration
Ascertaining whether invasive species are the drivers or passengers of ecological change is crucial for restoration and for optimizing management. Smith et al. (this issue) show that failed control of an invasive forb limits restoration, regardless of whether native species are actively planted. Management-based experiments that target the complementary processes of invasion and community assembly can help optimize restoration.
