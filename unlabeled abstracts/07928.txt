Relative attractiveness of some volatiles to the introduced pine bark beetles, Hylastes ater and Hylurgus ligniperda (Curculionidae: Scolytinae)
Raw turpentine, a- and b- pinene, and ethanol were tested as attractants to Hylastes ater and Hylurgus ligniperda. These volatiles were tested alone and in combination with ethanol using multiple funnel traps in cutover Pinus radiata forest. In comparison with combinations of a- and b- pinene, and ethanol, raw turpentine alone was a poor attractant for H. ligniperda and H. ater. With the addition of ethanol, raw turpentine was the most attractive volatile combination to H. ater, while a-pinenc and ethanol and b- pinene and ethanol were the most attractive volatile combinations to H. ligniperda.The addition of ethanol had a synergistic effect for all attractants, except a-pinenc to H. ater. Raw turpentine and ethanol is a suitable, low cost volatile combination for use in programmes to monitor populations of these bark beetles, and is a particularly effective attractant for use in H. ater trapping programmes.
