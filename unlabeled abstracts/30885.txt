Evolutionary Demography: The Invasion Exponent and the Effective Population Density in Nonlinear Matrix Models
The invasion exponent plays a critical role in life history theory. It measures the rate at which a new phenotype would grow if introduced at low densities into a population of a resident phenotype, which is on an attractor (equilibrium, cycle, invariant loop, or strange attractor). Only if the invasion exponent is positive will selection favor the phenotypic change represented by the difference between the invader and the resident. The selection gradient on the trait is measured by the sensitivity of the invasion exponent to a change in that parameter. This chapter reviews results on invasion exponents calculated from linear and nonlinear matrix population models. In addition to changing the parameter, a successful invasion will also lead to a new attractor, and thus affect population density. When the resident phenotype is at a stable equilibrium, the sensitivity of the invasion exponent is equal to the sensitivity of an effective equilibrium density, which is a weighted sum of the equilibrium stage densities. The weights measure the effect of the stage on density dependence and the effect of the density dependence on population growth rate. This chapter presents a new analysis, extending these results to invasions when the resident is on a periodic attractor, an invariant loop, or a strange attractor. In each case, the selection gradient is equal to the sensitivity of an effective average density, which is a weighted average over the attractor. The weights reflect the effect of each stage on the vital rates and on density dependence.
