Reproductive ecology of the invader species gekkonid lizard Hemidactylus mabouia in an area of southeastern Brazil
Hemidactylus mabouia Moreau de Jonnes, 1818 is a "fixed" clutch size exotic species well established in Brazil. In this paper we investigate some reproductive strategies adopted to minimize the costs of invariant clutch size to this invader species living in an environment with marked climatic seasonality in Southeastern Brazil (22deg56'S; 46deg55'W). The study was carried out from April 2002 to March 2003. Females and males attain maturity at 47.9mm and 46.9mm SVL, respectively. Larger females tended to produce larger eggs. The reproduction occurred throughout the year, but only at the wet season the females increase the clutch frequency. There was a significant variation in mean testis volume among the months throughout the year and the largest means were recorded between August and December. Maternal investment on egg size, increase on clutch frequency and seasonal increase on testis volume can represent important reproductive strategies of this invader species living in an non-urban habitat whit climatic seasonality (dry and cold weather season).
