Disturbance, resource pulses and invasion: short-term shifts in competitive effects, not growth responses, favour exotic annuals
1. Increased resource availability and resource pulses often promote invasion by exotic invasive plants, but the relative importance of increased resource supply for invaders with different life histories is likely to vary. It is also unclear whether increased resources allow invaders to outgrow their native neighbours or alter the outcome of competition. Understanding mechanisms by which different invasive life histories respond to resource supply will help to target the most important species to control.
