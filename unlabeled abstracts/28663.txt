Establishment success in introduced passeriforms of New Zealand: evidence for a Franklin Delano Roosevelt effect
Blackburn et al. (Biol Invasions doi:10.1007/s10530-013-0451-x, 2013) have proposed a series of tests that are purported to evaluate the motivations and decisions of early acclimatization societies that introduced passeriform birds to New Zealand. We show that the data are not consistent with their predictions and, moreover, their predictions are consistent with our alternative hypothesis. Thus, species they identify as being apparently successful species were released in significantly higher numbers than those they claim as unequivocal failures; the apparently successful species were released significantly fewer times and in significantly lower numbers than those designated as unequivocally successful species; persistence time of unsuccessful species was significantly and positively correlated with number of releases; and among species released just a single time there was no difference in propagule sizes of unsuccessful versus successful species. Thus, despite their counter claims, the results of Blackburn et al. (Biol Invasions doi:10.1007/s10530-013-0451-x, 2013) clearly show that patterns in establishment are consistent with the historical record and what they have termed a "Franklin Delano Roosevelt Effect".
