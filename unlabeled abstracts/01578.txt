Characterization of novel microsatellite markers for Eschscholzia californica (Papaveraceae), an invasive species in central Chile
Premise of the study: We isolated and characterized microsatellite markers for the California poppy, Eschscholzia californica, which is an invasive species in central Chile. Methods and results: A total of eight polymorphic and six monomorphic loci were developed for the species. Between one and 12 alleles were observed per locus. Polymorphic loci showed heterozygosity ranging from 0 to 0.875 in a sample of 96 individuals obtained from four populations. Only one locus showed significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at all sites. Conclusions: The successful microsatellite amplification makes this set of primers an important tool for understanding the recent and future patterns of invasion and adaptation of E. californica into the new Chilean geographic area. The variation detected is currently being used in a more inclusive study that assesses population expansion in central Chile.
