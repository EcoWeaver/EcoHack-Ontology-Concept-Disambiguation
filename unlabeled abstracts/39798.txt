First record of the red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) on Socotra Island (Yemen), an exotic pest with high potential for adverse economic impacts
We report on the first finding of a widespread exotic pest species, the red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) on date palms Phoenix dactylifera L. (Arecaceae) on Socotra Island, Yemen. Our initial surveys reveal that the pest species is present in date palm plantations on the north-eastern coast of the island, within 5 km of the capital Hadiboh. More surveys are needed to determine the wider distribution of this palm pest on Socotra, and what impact current invasions are having on date production. This invasion, together with the impact of the dubas bug, Ommatissus lybicus de Bergevin (Hemiptera: Tropiduchidae), which seems well established on the island, is likely to have a significant negative impact on livelihoods, since dates are the most important locally produced food, after milk and meat. The invasion provides ample evidence of the risks associated with trade, and the need to strengthen biosecurity measures to protect traditional food production and biodiversity from further pest incursions in this UNESCO World Heritage Site.Graphic abstract
