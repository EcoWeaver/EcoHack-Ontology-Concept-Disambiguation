Hybridization can facilitate species invasions, even without enhancing local adaptation
Significance Species colonizations frequently occur in regions already occupied by other species of the same genus, or by other genotypes of the same species. When hybrid genotypes become more invasive than their parents, improved local adaptation is inevitably assumed. Here, we show that there is another way that hybridization could facilitate invasions, by temporarily overcoming pollen limitation when populations are small. We verify this conclusion using two contemporary sequential invaders, a plant analog of the Neanderthal-modern human system. Our findings indicate that it may be misleading to assume that all cases of invasive hybrids result from enhanced phenotypic suitability. Our hypothesis may be even more relevant to animal species because, unlike plants, animals can rarely escape mate limitation by self-fertilization.
