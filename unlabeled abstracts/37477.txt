Hirsutella sp. (Hypocreales: Ophiocordycipitaceae) Affecting the Invasive Social Wasp Vespula vulgaris (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) in Southern Chile
In Chile, the invasive and noxious pest Vespula vulgaris (L.) (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) was first reported in 2011 in the Araucania region and is currently distributed between Araucania and Magallanes regions. In Mar 2015 (autumn), during an ongoing monitoring of funnel traps by the Servicio Agricola y Ganadero, a fungus-infected individual was collected. The fungus was identified morphologically as a species of Hirsutella (Hypocreales: Ophiocordycipitaceae). This is the first report of any Hirsutella species on V. vulgaris in Chile. No in vitro cultures were successfully established from the infected insect.
