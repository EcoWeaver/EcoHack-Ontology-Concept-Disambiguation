Status of the exotic ant Nylanderia flavipes (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in northeastern Ohio
In 2005, the non-native Nylanderia flavipes was first recorded from Ohio. Here, we present the results of a baseline study designed to assess the status of this exotic species in northeastern Ohio and to explore its potential impacts on local ant communities and the extent to which it has been incorporated into the diet of a native predator, the red-backed salamander. At the sites where N. flavipes occurred, we found a sixfold increase in total ant abundance, with 87% of all ants collected being N. flavipes. The high numerical dominance of N. flavipes did not lead to observable changes in the species richness and abundance of the native ant community. At baits, N. flavipes did not engage in interspecific combat and did not exhibit aggression towards native ants. Thus, aggression and interference competition are not likely factors explaining the high local abundance of N. flavipes. Red-backed salamanders have incorporated N. flavipes into their diet, but further research is needed to understand the interactions of N. flavipes within the forest-floor food web. Although we did not detect changes in the local ant communities in the presence of N. flavipes, we argue that this species' high local abundance and ability to forage at cooler temperatures may give it a competitive advantage and thereby affect native ants through exploitative competition.
