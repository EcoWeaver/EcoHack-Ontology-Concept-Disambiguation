Using YY supermales to destabilize invasive fish populations
A plausible biocontrol strategy for the eradication of invasive species involves augmenting wild populations with genetically modified supermales. Supermales contain double chromosomes. When they are augmented into a wild population, destabilization and eventual extinction occurs over time due to a strongly skewed gender ratio towards males. Here, we employ a mathematical model that considers an Allee effect, but we have discovered through simulation that the presence of supermales leads to an increase in the minimal number of females needed for survival at a value higher than the mathematically defined Allee effect. Using this effect, we focus our research on exploring the sensitivity of the optimized supply rate of supermale fish to the initial gender ratio and density of the wild populations. We find that the eradication strategy with an optimized supply rate of supermales can be determined with knowledge of reproductive rate and survival fitness of supermale fish.
