Using analogous climates and global insect distribution data to identify potential sources of new invasive insect pests in New Zealand
Global regions climatically analogous to Auckland, New Zealand were identified by an eco-climatic assessment model, CLIMEX, to determine possible sources of new insect pest invasions. World distribution maps of recognised insect pest species were used to record the presence or absence of each species within the identified analogous regions. South-east Australia, western Europe and the east coast of the United States are climatically very similar to Auckland, New Zealand, and furthermore, New Zealand shares many insect pest species with these regions. Since these regions also have close trade and tourism links with New Zealand, any new insect incursions recorded within these analogous climates should be of concern to biosecurity authorities in New Zealand. Consequent risk analysis could be more efficient at identifying potentially harmful organisms and reduce the chances of a new pest establishing in New Zealand.
