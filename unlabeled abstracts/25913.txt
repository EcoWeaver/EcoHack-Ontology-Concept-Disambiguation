Prospects for the cultivation of economically important carrageenophytes in Southeast Mexico
Carrageenan, a hydrocolloid used in the food and pharmaceutical industry mainly as a thickener and stabilizer, has an annual global market of US $450 million. In Mexico, carrageenan imports doubled during the last years, reaching 4,400t in 2008. Any carrageenan industrial project demands a regular supply of raw material from reliable sources capable to meet and maintain required volumes and qualities. Some carrageenophytes have been exploited traditionally in Baja California Peninsula (i.e., Chondracanthus canaliculatus). The recent demand, however, for carrageenan has increased the development of cultivation of economically important seaweeds mainly in the tropics. In the Yucatan peninsula, experimental cultivation of native and exotic species has been carried out during the last 10years. Eucheuma isiforme, Solieria filiformis, Halymenia floresii, and the introduced Kappaphycus alvarezii represent potential raw material sources for the production of carrageenan. Demand for iota carrageenan-producing species which could be sourced from native species is not a market priority. On the contrary, the most in demand are kappa and lambda carrageenan-producing species. In this study, we analyze the prospects for the commercial cultivation of tropical economically important seaweeds in the Yucatan peninsula.
