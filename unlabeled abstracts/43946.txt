Alien Plant Invasions in India: Current Status and Management Challenges
Invasive species are a major driver of global environmental change contributing to the loss of biodiversity, altering of ecosystem structure and functioning, and affecting provision of ecosystem services worldwide, including in India. In view of globalization of Indian economy and consequential increase in international travel and trade, introduction, establishment and spread of alien species is likely to escalate in India with serious ecological and socio-economic consequences. A recent study has reported the occurrence of 1,599 alien plant species belonging to 841 genera in 161 families in India, and the alien flora thus represents 8.5 % of the total Indian vascular flora. While the taxonomic inventory of alien species represents the first important step, but more detailed studies on characterization of alien species on the basis of their stage of invasion, identification of potentially invasible habitats/ecosystems, detection of introduction pathways and vectors of alien species, assessment, mapping and monitoring of invasive species using modern geo-spatial technology such as hyperspectral remote sensing, impact assessment, containment, control and restoration are still lacking in India and hence impede effective management of plant invasions in the country. It is in this context that an integrated research and policy framework for the management of alien plant invasions in India is proposed.
