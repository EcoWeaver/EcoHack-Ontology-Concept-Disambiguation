Interactions of cadmium and zinc in high zinc tolerant native species Andropogon gayanus cultivated in hydroponics: growth endpoints, metal bioaccumulation, and ultrastructural analysis
Cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) toxicity causes physiological disorders and harms plants, interfering with the rehabilitation of areas affected by mining activities. This study evaluated how the exposure to Zn and/or Cd affects the growth of native andropogon grass (Andropogon gayanus Kunth) plants originally found in areas contaminated with Cd and/or Zn due to zinc mining activities. Plants were cultivated for 7 weeks in a nutrient solution treated with Zn (142.3-854.0 mM) or Cd (0.9-13.3 mM) separately or combined with a molar ratio of 64:1 (Zn:Cd). A control treatment was grown in a complete Hoagland and Arnon solution (without Cd). Plant height, stem diameter, internode length, dry weight, Cd and Zn concentration, and accumulation in shoots/roots, as well as ultrastructure of roots and leaves were analyzed at the end of the experiment. The root dry weight was not significantly affected by the addition of the metals. Moreover, Zn provided higher shoot dry weight (up to 160%) relative to control. Andropogon grass tolerated both metals better separately than when applied together. Transmission electron microscopy analyses showed modifications such as vesiculation and vacuolation in the ultrastructure of andropogon tissues by Cd and/or Zn. The andropogon grass was tolerant to the doses tested, evidencing that it has potential for recovering areas contaminated with Zn and/or Cd.
