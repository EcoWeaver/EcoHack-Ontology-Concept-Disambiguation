Physiological measurements from native and transplanted mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) in the canals of Venice. Survival in air and condition index
The Venice Lagoon has been the focus of many environmental studies due to its heavy contaminant load derived from a variety of sources, including industrial activity, oil tanker traffic, and waste runoff from the mainland. In recent years, there has been increasing concern about water quality in the urban areas of Venice related to the discharge of untreated sewage directly into canals, adding to the pollutant load already existing in these areas. One way of gauging the impact of these chemicals is monitoring the local fauna. In the search for good indicators of water quality in the Venice urban area, two physiological indices for mussels-survival in air and condition index-have been evaluated. In 2002, a seasonal study was undertaken; mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were collected in three sites located in the canals of the city and a clean reference site. At the same time, two transplantation experiments were performed, deploying farmed mussels for 1,2, 4, and 12 weeks in the historic centre of Venice and also at a reference site. Data from survival in air test and the condition index of native and transplanted mussels are reported. The results suggest an impact of the complex mixture of pollutants on mussel health status. Both native mussels and those transplanted to the urban area showed reduced survivability in air and decreased condition index values, indicating a less healthy status in animals from the canals of the city. Data are discussed in relation to pollutant bioaccumulation.
