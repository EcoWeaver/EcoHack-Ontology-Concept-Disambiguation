Age, growth, and ontogenetic variation in the sagitta otolith of Opsanus beta (Goode & Bean, 1880), a non-native species in a wetland of international importance
Invasive species are among the most important problems for biodiversity conservation worldwide, particularly in megadiverse countries such as Brazil. However, there is no biological information to develop policies for managing invasive species populations in many cases. The life history parameters and otolith variations are essential to understanding the adaptations of the species introduced in marine environments. This study aimed to identify the age structure and ontogenetic variation in the sagitta otolith of Opsanus beta. Fish samples were obtained monthly in the Paranagua Estuarine Complex (PEC), south of Brazil. The shape indices verified ontogenetic variations in the otoliths (PERMANOVA; F = 110; P < 0.0001), but no sexual variations were observed in the shape of the otoliths (PERMANOVA; F = 3.65; P > 0.05). Specimen aged between 1 to 9 years were observed in the PEC, with the highest occurrence of individuals between 3 and 6 years (78%). No sexual differences were observed between the ages by the Kimura test. Our results confirm that the O. beta population is well established with age groups similar to that observed in the region where the species is native.
