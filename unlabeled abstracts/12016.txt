Spatial patterns and spread of exotic earthworms at local scales
Given the substantial impacts of non-native species on invaded systems, an understanding of the rates and spatial patterns of invasive spread is critical. Spread may vary across spatial scales, with dispersal of invasive species occurring both via diffusive spread at local sites and long-distance jump dispersal at larger scales. Research on earthworm invasions in North American forests has focused on patterns of spread across landscapes, with less examination of spread at local sites. We sampled the exotic earthworm Dendrobaena octaedra (Savigny, 1826) on 500 m x 500 m grids at three sites in the boreal forest of northeastern Alberta in 2006 and again in 2012-2013 to examine distributional changes over time. Earthworms spread farther from roads (the presumed site of initial introduction) over time, and spatial patterns at our sites suggest transport by vehicles and waterways are key vectors of dispersal at the local level. Spread was estimated to be occurring at a rate of at least 17.9 m/year. Our study indicates that both diffusive spread and jump dispersal of earthworms can be important at local scales and that local diffusive spread may be substantially higher than previously estimated.
