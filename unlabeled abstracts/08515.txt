Photoperiodic effects on diapause-associated gene expression trajectories in European Leptinotarsa decemlineata populations.
Behavioral and physiological changes during diapause, an important strategy of insects for surviving harsh seasonal conditions, have been intensively studied. The genetic and molecular mechanisms underpinning diapause development are less well known. We took a candidate gene approach to study pre-diapause gene expression patterns in the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), an invasive insect which has rapidly spread northwards to high seasonality environments. Newly eclosed beetles originating from southern (Italy) and northern (Russia) Europe were reared under short- (12L:12D) and long-day (18L:6D) photoperiods for 10 days. This time period includes the sensitive period for the photoperiodic induction and initiation of diapause. Gene expression trajectories of 12 diapause related genes (regulatory, metabolic and stress-resistance) were analyzed from 0, 5 and 10 day-old beetles. Gene expression differences increased with age, deviating significantly between populations and photoperiods in 10 day-old beetles. The gene expression profiles, particularly related to energy metabolism and stress-resistance, indicate that beetles originating from Russia prepare for diapause also under the long-day photoperiod and show qualitative differences in the diapausing phenotype. Our study shows that population dependent differences seen in behavioral and physiological traits connected with diapause in L. decemlineata are evident also in the expression trajectories of diapause-related genes.
