Invasion, genetic variation and species identity of the calanoid copepodSinodiaptomus valkanovi
1. Although Sinodiaptomus valkanovi [sensu Ueda & Ohtsuka (Hydrobiologia, 379, 1998, 159)] is one of the most common freshwater calanoid copepods in Japan, it was originally described from specimens collected in Sofia, Bulgaria, as a subspecies of S. sarsi. This original description raises two issues requiring further investigation. One is whether or not S. valkanovi should be differentiated from S. sarsi at a species level, and the other is whether or not records of S. valkanovi from outside of Japan are the result of biological invasions.
