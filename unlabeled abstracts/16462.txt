Byssal hairs in the invasive Asian freshwater bivalveLimnoperna fortunei(Mytilidae) in the Parana River system with comments on this species in South America
We recorded, for the first time, byssal hairs in the Asian freshwater bivalve Limnoperna fortunei from the Parana River system. We analysed the presence of hairs and their distribution on the shell in relation to habitat and shell size in 12 sites. Hairs were present in lentic habitats associated with macrophytes or organic matter, but were absent in lotic environments. The proportion of mussels with hairs was negatively correlated with current velocity. Hairs were more frequent and abundant in larger mussels. In general, the hairs are a similar length over the bivalve and almost entirely cover the shells in>=60% in lentic habitats. The projections allow L. fortunei to be camouflaged among the roots of macrophytes or coarse organic matter, assisting in avoiding visual predators. The clear-cut separation of L. fortunei populations into two different groups could be associated with phenotypic plasticity in this species.
