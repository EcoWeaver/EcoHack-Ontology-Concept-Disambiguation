Plant community dynamics relative to the changing distribution of a highly invasive species, Eichhornia crassipes: a remote sensing perspective
Eradicating or controlling invasive alien species has frequently had unintended consequences, such as proliferation of other invasive species or loss of ecosystem function. We explore this problem using a case study of a highly invasive floating aquatic macrophyte, water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California. We used 5 years of remote sensing data to perform change detection analysis to study plant community dynamics contemporaneous with changes in water hyacinth cover. Our results show that as water hyacinth cover decreased, submerged aquatic plant (SAP) cover increased and vice versa. This effect was strongest in large patches of water hyacinth. We found no evidence that the native floating aquatic species, pennywort (Hydrocotyle umbellata), benefitted from reducing cover of water hyacinth. In most years, pennywort cover either showed no trend or followed the same trajectory as water hyacinth cover. In this study a decrease in cover of water hyacinth most often resulted in colonization by SAP species with some habitat returning to open water.
