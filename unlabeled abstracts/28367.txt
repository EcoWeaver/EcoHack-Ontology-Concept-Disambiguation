New records of alien species on the Levantine coast of Turkey
Zoobenthic investigations carried out along the Turkish Levantine coast resulted in identification of nine previously unrecorded alien species: Macrorhynchia philippina (Hydrozoa), Oculina patagonica (Antho-zoa), Branchiomma luctuosum (Polychaeta), Aplysia dactylomela (Gastropoda), Synaptula reciprocans (Echinodermata), Phallusia nigra, Pyura (=Herdmania) momus, Symplegma brakenhielmi (Tunicata) and Parupeneus forsskali (Osteichthyes). Except for the shipping-transported O. patagonica, which originat-ed in the Atlantic Ocean, the species are recognized as Erythrean aliens that entered the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal. Some ecological and distributional details are briefly discussed.
