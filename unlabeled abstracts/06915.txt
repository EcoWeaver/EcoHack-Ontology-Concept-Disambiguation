The Effect of Gender, Tone, and Sound Location on the Response Behavior of Neogobius melanostomus (Round Goby) and the Possibility of Future Trapping of this Invasive Species in Lake Superior
Neogobius melanostomus (round goby) are a benthic dwelling invasive species of fish in the Great Lakes. This study was done to determine if a tone that mimics the frequency (175 Hz) of mating call of a male round goby would have an effect on male and female response. A testing tank and a simulated trap in front of a speaker at each end were used. Each fish was then placed individually into the small holding box that was in the center of the tank. A video camera was then turned on to record fish movement once the door was opened. Next, the artificial sound was turned on for 1 min (175, 300, 500 Hz, and no sound); 175 Hz mimics the conspecific mating call. This process was done for each frequency for each fish. The individual fish was then allowed to roam for 5 min. The video camera recorded fish location and behavior. From the videos, a continuous measure was collected according to when the fish crossed the center line. The hypothesis, if (N. melanostomus) hears different frequencies of sound projected from a certain location in a fish tank habitat, then the females will be attracted and spend more time on the sound-emitting side of the tank, which mimics the frequency of mating call of a male round goby (175 Hz, 13 pulse), was supported; females spent more time on the sound-emitting side of the tank and males avoided the sound-emitting side of the tank, analysis of variance p < 0.012.
