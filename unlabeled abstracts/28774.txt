Threat of An Invasive Parasitic Fly, the Deer Ked (Lipoptena cervi), to the Reindeer (Rangifer Tarandus Tarandus): Experimental Infection and Treatment
Range expansion of ectoparasites can cause parasites to attack new host species. In these cases it is important for the parasite to be able to adapt to the new environment and to reproduce on the host. For the host, it is crucial to hinder successfully the development of long-lasting parasitic relationship. The deer ked ( Lipoptena cervi) is a novel ectoparasite for northern cervids. We investigated of the deer ked can use the reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) as a host and, if it can, wether antiparsitic treatment against this parasite would be available. Three groups of reindeer were monitored: two groups of 6 reindeerr were infected with 300 flies per each individual; a control group comprised 6 animals. One of the infected groups was treated with subcutaneous ivermectin. At the end of the experiment the infextation rate of the infected animals was low. The reindeer in the non-treated group had both live and dead deer keds and also a single pupa while the ivermectin-treated reindeer had only dead deer keds. As some deer keds survided and reproduced, thedeer ked can potentially use the reindeer as a host but antiparasitic treatment may be effective agains this parasite.
