Alien plant species and factors of invasiveness of anthropogenic vegetation in the Northwestern Balkans -- a phytosociological approach
We studied the anthropogenic vegetation of the Northwest Balkans in order to determine its susceptibility to invasion by alien plant species. We compiled a dataset of 3089 vegetation plots sampled between 1939 and 2009, recording a set of variables for each sample plot in order to determine which factors have the most effect on a habitat's vulnerability to invaders. We calculated the proportion of native species, archaeophytes and neophytes for each plot. We used regression tree models to determine the site conditions of the most invaded anthropogenic habitats. The sample plots contained an average of 12.7% alien plant species, with a low proportion of archaeophytes (4.3%) and 8.4% neophytes. Local habitat conditions proved to have the largest effect, rather than climatic variables or propagule pressure. The proportion of archaeophytes follows a different pattern than that seen in central and northern Europe, indicating that macroecological factors are more important. Neophytes show a similar distribution to other European locations.
