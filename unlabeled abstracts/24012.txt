Wildlife Research in a changing world
Wildlife populations on both land and in the sea are under increasing pressure from both direct and indirect anthropogenic impacts. Threats to wildlife, such as over-exploitation, habitat loss, invasive species, infectious disease and climate change persist; yet in some situations, wildlife populations are the subject of management to reduce their unwanted impacts on economic, agricultural and conservation interests. The contrasting requirements of declining and overabundant populations, sometimes existing as part of the same ecosystem, mean that wildlife management needs to be viewed increasingly as part of an integrated social-ecological system. Moreover, solutions to wildlife-management problems may require new combinations of ecological knowledge, technological innovation and an understanding of the social and economic factors involved. The disciplinary scope of Wildlife Research will be broadening to reflect these changes. Wildlife Research has tended to focus on terrestrial systems in the past, but research approaches and findings are increasingly relevant across different environments, and consequently, we will also be expanding our coverage of freshwater and marine systems. We are planning to publish at least one Special Issue each year, to highlight new areas of research and the increasing internationalisation of wildlife management, and we welcome suggestions for these. We are also pleased to be able to offer fast-track publication of papers that contain results of high topical significance or policy relevance. We hope that the increased topical, disciplinary and geographical coverage of Wildlife Research will enhance its position as one of the leading international journals in applied ecology and environmental management.
