Non-native species in reservoirs: how are we doing in Brazil?
The Brazilian Environmental Ministry (MMA) released a report in 2016 listing 163 non-native species into Brazilian inland waters. Reservoirs are among the freshwater habitats most frequently associated with the release of non-native species. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the occurrence and distribution of the non-native species listed by the MMA, in large Brazilian reservoirs (>= 30 km2). Further, we have tested the hypothesis that beta diversity of non-native species within reservoirs from the same basin is lower than those among reservoirs from distinct basins. A literature search was performed for 70 Brazilian reservoirs, resulting in the records of 91 non-native species. Reservoirs from the Parana basin showed the highest number of occurrences, with 33 non-native species recorded only in the Itaipu reservoir. Beta diversity of non-native species showed higher variability among reservoirs from different basins than those within the same basin. Some basins were also distinguished by their composition of non-native species, as supported by the IndVal index. Non-native species were widespread along Brazilian reservoirs, and their distribution can be even higher than reported.
