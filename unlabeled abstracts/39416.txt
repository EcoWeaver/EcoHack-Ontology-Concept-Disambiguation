Invasive ant establishment, spread, and management with changing climate
Ant invasions and climate change both pose globally widespread threats to the environment and economy. I highlight our current knowledge of how climate change will affect invasive ant distributions, population growth, spread, impact, and invasive ant management. Invasive ants often have traits that enable rapid colony growth in a range of habitats. Consequently, many invasive ant species will continue to have large global distributions as environmental conditions change. Distributions and impacts at community scales will depend on how resident ant communities respond to local abiotic conditions as well as availability of plant-based carbohydrate resources. Though target species may change under an altered climate, invasive ant impacts are unlikely to diminish, and novel control methods will be necessary.
