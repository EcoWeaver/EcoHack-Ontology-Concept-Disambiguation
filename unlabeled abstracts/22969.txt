Analyses of Thinopyrum bessarabicum, T. elongatum, and T. junceum chromosomes using EST-SSR markers
Wild Thinopyrum grasses are important gene pools for forage and cereal crops. Knowledge of their chromosome organizations is pivotal for efficient utilization of this important gene pool in germplasm enhancement programs. Expressed sequence tags derived simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers for Thinopyrum bessarabicum, T. elongatum, and T. junceum chromosomes were identified among amplicons produced from three series of wheat-Thinopyrum addition lines using 193 primer pairs designed from the Leymus EST unigenes. The homology of T. junceum chromosomes in 13 wheat addition lines was tentatively established to reveal that homologous groups 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were represented by HD3515, HD3505, AJDAj11, AJDAj1, and HD3508, whereas groups 1 and 2 were represented by AJADj7-AJDAj9 and AJDAj2-AJDAj4, respectively. AJDAj5 and AJDAj6 had complexly reconstituted T. junceum chromosomes that might have resulted from fusion or translocations of large chromosomal segments from two or more chromosomes, that is (1+5) and (2+5+1), respectively. The identified EST-SSR markers will be useful in comparative gene mapping, chromosome tracing, taxonomic studies, gene introgression, and cultivar identification.
