Evaluation system for management measures of invasive alien species
The introduction and spread of invasive alien species is a serious threat to ecosystem structures, functions and services worldwide. At enormous cost and effort, attempts are being made to stop and reduce the ongoing appearance of alien species in ecosystems to protect the regional and native biodiversity. Still, management of invasive alien species in particular is often not successful. One reason is a lack of robust toolkits for the management of these species. Guidance on measures which are efficient and effective and which have no negative impact on the environment and human health is urgently needed for decision-making. As a result of an expert workshop, we present a set of three evaluation criteria: effectiveness, ecological impact, and impact on human health. These criteria allow an evaluation of management measures for the prevention, eradication, control and utilisation/disposal of invasive alien species for nature conservation purposes. We applied this evaluation system for 168 invasive and potentially invasive alien species of five taxonomic groups (fungi, non-vascular plants, vascular plants, invertebrates and vertebrates) involving 3619 different management measures. The evaluation of management measures and resulting recommendations for their application are a necessary basis for appropriate, ecologically necessary and professionally sound management. This new approach provides an essential framework for future decisions on management measures, for example in accordance with the provisions of the new Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species.
