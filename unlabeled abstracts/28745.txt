Hypoxic wetland tributaries as faunal refugia from an introduced predator
Abstract- The introduction of Nile perch (Lates niloticus) into the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa has coincided with the decline or disappearance of hundreds of indigenous species. To mitigate additional biodiversity loss, we must learn what limits the spread of Nile perch and what habitats serve as refugia for prey species. Heavily vegetated wetlands may protect fishes from Nile perch predation by providing both structural and low-oxygen refugia for prey species tolerant of hypoxia. To examine the potential of wetlands as refugia we quantified the composition, persistence, and stability of fish assemblages in a wetland tributary of Lake Nabugabo, a satellite lake of Lake Victoria in which Nile perch have been introduced. Nile perch were extremely rare in the wetland, and nine of the 18 species that have disappeared from the open waters of the satellite lake were captured in the tributary in this study. Dissolved oxygen was chronically low in the river and may be important in shaping fish community characteristics. Faunal attenuation occurred as the dry season progressed and oxygen levels dropped; however, the most common species remained through seasonal changes. The chronically low oxygen conditions in the werland tributary may permit persistence of only hypoxia-tolerant species. However, wetland conditions seem to limit exploitation by Nile perch providing critical refugia for a subset of the basin fauna.
