An exotic species spreads through Europe: Tygarrup javanicus (Chilopoda: Geophilomorpha: Mecistocephalidae) is reported from the Slovakia and the Czech Republic
Geophilomorph centipedes, due to their soil life style, are frequently transported with plants. This report tries to underline some adaptations that facilitate them being introduced and becoming alien species. Tygarrup javanicus (Attems, 1907), tropical species reported recently from different greenhouses in Central Europe, is used as an example of such a spreading species.
