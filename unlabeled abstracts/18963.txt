First record of the invasive brackish water mytilid Limnoperna securis (Lamarck, 1819) in the Bay of Biscay
The occurrence of the non-indigenous species Limnoperna securis belonging to Mytilidae family is recorded for the first time in the Bay of Biscay. Numerous individuals were collected in intertidal and shallow waters in the inner part of Nervion estuary (Bizkaia, Basque Country, SE Bay of Biscay). In the present paper, notes about the history of this small brown mussel invasion, vectors of introduction and dispersal, as well as consequences of invasion are discussed.
