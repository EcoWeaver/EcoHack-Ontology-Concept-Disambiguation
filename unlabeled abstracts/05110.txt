Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to Aspergillus lentulus: Successful treatment of a liver transplant patient
We report a patient with severe invasive pulmonary fungal infection caused by Aspergilllus lentulus, which was identified by genetic analysis, following liver transplantation. The patient was initially suspected to have Aspergilllus fumigatus infection, but worsened clinically despite antifungal therapy appropriate for that species. The patient survived after accurate diagnosis, and detailed drug susceptibility testing led to adequate therapy, demonstrating the importance of performing these investigations for severely immunocompromised patients, including organ transplant recipients.
