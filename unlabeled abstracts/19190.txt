Transgressive character expression in hybrid zones between the native invasives Tithonia tubaeformis and Tithonia rotundifolia (Asteraceae) in Mexico
Natural hybridization frequently promotes gene introgression among closely related species in sympatric populations, producing complex patterns of morphological variation. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the dynamics of interspecific gene flow and its morphological patterns is of widespread interest. We tested if introgressive hybridization promotes an increase in transgressive characters in comparison with the parental species. A sunflower species complex occurring in Mexico formed by two native invasive species, Tithonia tubaeformis and Tithonia rotundifolia, was analyzed using 46 morphological characters (leaf, flower and fruit) in five hybrid zones (N = 150 individuals) and two pure sites for each parental species (N = 80 individuals). In general, T. tubaeformis differed significantly from T. rotundifolia in all the examined characters, except six foliar and one inflorescence character. Morphological characters support the hypothesis of hybridization in this complex, even though both species remain morphological distinct in mixed stands. Individual hybrids appear to be a mosaic of parent-like (24.8 % of traits), intermediate (26.1 %) and transgressive (37.8 %) phenotypes (the remaining 11.3 % of the traits did not differ significantly from both parental species). Our results suggest that individuals from the same parental species were more similar among themselves than to putative hybrids, indicating occasional hybridization with segregation in hybrid types or backcrossing to parents. Evidence indicates a unidirectional pattern of gene flow toward T. rotundifolia.
