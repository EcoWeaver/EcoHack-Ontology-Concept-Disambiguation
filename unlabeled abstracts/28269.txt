The Oriental drosophilid Cacoxenus (Gitonides) campsiphallus, a predator of invasive mealybugs: First record for Palearctic region and female's description
Cacoxenus (Gitonides) campsiphallus Chassagnard and Tsacas, 2003 is a poorly studied Oriental drosophilid, with larvae preying on mealybugs. This species was originally described based on a male specimen from India. The female is currently unknown. In this research, we found twenty individuals of C. (G.) campsiphallus preying the invasive mealybug Maconellicoccus hirsutus in southern Iran. The C. (G.) campsiphallus female was described, followed by a redescription of the male. Our study is the first record of this Oriental drosophilid for the whole Palearctic region. Further knowledge is needed about the biology and ecology of this drosophilid species, a potential biocontrol organism against invasive mealybugs.
