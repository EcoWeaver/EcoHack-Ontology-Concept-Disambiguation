The Erythrina Gall Wasp Quadrastichus erythrinae (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Eulophidae): Invasion History, Ecology, Infestation and Management
The Erythrina gall wasp Quadrastichus erythrinae Kim (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is an invasive insect that induces galls on coral trees (species of Erythrina, Fabaceae) in urban and suburban landscapes. Weakening and death of the tree were both observed after the infestation by this insect, wherein feeding and consequent draining of nutrients by a large population of Q. erythrinae could be playing a key role. In this article, we consolidate and summarize the information on the distribution, invasion route, ecology, infestation level, and management of Q. erythrinae populations in the last two decades and analyze the challenges in their management.
