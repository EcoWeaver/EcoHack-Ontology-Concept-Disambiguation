Size-dependent flight capacity and propensity in a range-expanding invasive insect
For capital-breeding insects, all resources available for adult metabolic needs are accumulated during larval feeding. Therefore, body size at adult eclosion represents the total energetic capacity of the individual. For female capital breeders, body size is strongly correlated with lifetime fecundity, while in males, body size correlates with fitness are less understood. In capital-breeding species with wingless, flightless, or dispersal-limited females, flight potential for male Lepidoptera has important implications for mate-finding and may be correlated with body size. At low population densities, failure to mate has been identified as an important Allee effect and can drive the success or failure of invasive species at range edges and in species of conservation concern. The European gypsy moth (EGM), Lymantria dispar (L.), a capital breeder, was introduced to North America in 1869 and now ranges across much of eastern North America. In EGM, females are flightless and mate-finding is entirely performed by males. We quantified male EGM flight capacity and propensity to fly relative to morphological and physiological characteristics using fixed-arm flight mills. A range of male body sizes were produced by varying the protein content of standard artificial diets while holding other dietary components constant. Wing length, a proxy for body size, as well as relative thorax mass and forewing aspect were all important predictors of total flight distance and maximum speed. These results have important implications for mate-finding and invasion dynamics in gypsy moth and may apply broadly to other capital-breeding insects. This article is protected by copyright.
