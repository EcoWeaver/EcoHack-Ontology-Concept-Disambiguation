The effect of temperature, water level and burial depth on seed germination of Myriophyllum spicatum and Potamogeton malaianus
The effects of temperature, water level and burial depth on seed germination of two submerged species, Myriophyllum spicatum and Potamogeton malaianus, were investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. There was no significant difference in final germination of M. spicatum among water level treatments, but P. malaianus germinations at 1 cm and 12 cm water levels were better than at 0 cmwater level at temperatures of 20 8C and 30 8C. Little to no germination was observed for either species at the temperature of 10 8C. At 15 8C, however, germination increased significantly to 66.3-70.6% for M. spicatum and to 29.4-48.1% for P. malaianus under all three water level treatments. Increased temperature from 15 8C to 30 8C had no significant effect on the final germination of M. spicatum except at the 1 cmwater level, but enhanced significantly the germination of P. malaianus. Analysis of the mean time to germination revealed that M. spicatum was a faster germinator relative to P. malaianus. The two species' germination differed markedly in response to burial depth. Germination percentage of M. spicatum was 71.3% at 0 cm burial depth, but decreased to 5.0% and to 2.5% at depths of 1 cm and 2 cm, respectively; whereas germination percentages of P. malaianus were 40.0%, 23.8%, 12.5%, 7.5% and 1.3% at depths of 0 cm, 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm and 5 cm, respectively. We concluded that the two species respond differently to germination strategies. The findings provided further insight into how germination strategy contributes to the seed bank formation and species invasion.
