Vegetation recovery in a desert landscape after wildfires: influences of community type, time since fire and contingency effects
1. Theories of plant succession are poorly developed in arid lands, hindering our understanding of how long communities may take to recover after disturbances such as fire. In desert landscapes vulnerable to fire, information about vegetation recovery is important when deciding whether land managers should facilitate vegetation recovery. The deserts of the southwestern USA are increasingly subject to unprecedented fires, facilitated by fuel from exotic grasses, yet management strategies are unclear.
