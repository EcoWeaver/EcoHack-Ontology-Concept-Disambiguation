Growth performance of five different strains of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) introduced to Tanzania reared in fresh and brackish waters
Five introduced strains of Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus ) were tested for growth performance both in fresh- and brackish-water (2 salinity units) environments for 56 days. The BIG NIN, GIFT, Chitralada, "Ruvu Farm" and Silver YY strains with initial mean average weight (+- standard error) of 96.4 +- 6.90 g, 104.1 +- 7.19 g, 137.2 +- 7.21 g, 53.2 +- 6.98 g and 95.3 +- 7.11 g, respectively were used. Individuals were tagged and pooled in hapas (12 m x 8.5 m x 2 m each), aligned into different ponds (20 m x 20 m each). Stocking density of 5 fish/m 2 and 350 g/kg crude protein diet were used. Overall, the average weight gain for GIFT strain was 7.5%, 32%, 45% and 86.5% higher than BIG NIN, Chitralada, "Ruvu Farm" and Silver YY strains, respectively, across both environments. All strains performed significantly better (p < 0.05) when reared in brackish-water than their respective counterparts in freshwater, except for the BIG NIN strain. The morphometric correlations for all strains in both environments ranged from moderate (0.50) to strong positive (0.92). The GIFT strain demonstrated superior growth and genotype by environment interaction was weak and not important to be prioritized in breeding programs.
