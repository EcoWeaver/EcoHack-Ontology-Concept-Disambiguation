Interspecies transmission of Edwardsiella ictaluri in Brazilian catfish (Pseudoplatystoma corruscans) from exotic invasive fish species
Infections caused by Edwardsiella ictaluri are one of the biggest problems for the catfish industry in North America and was reported in other fishes around the world. An occurrence of E. ictaluri was detected in farmed pintado juveniles (Pseudoplatystoma corruscans), a Brazilian catfish, in Parana state. The diseased animals showed ascites and neurological signs, with more than 50% mortality. Some species susceptible to this bacterium are reported as invasive in the area. Also, we assessed the susceptibility of pintado against E. ictaluri in an experimental infection via intraperitoneal and immersion, as well as a cohabitation experiment with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and African walking catfish (Clarias gariepinus), two exotic invasive species. All pintados challenged by intraperitoneal and immersion routes and cohabiting with infected C. gariepinus died within 17 days of the challenge. Nile tilapia had 71.42% mortality in the intraperitoneal challenge and 35.71% in immersion within 28 days, whereas African walking catfish showed zero mortality. Observed clinical signs were compatible with those in the farm, and the described in the literature as Enteric Septicemia of Catfish. With this, we demonstrated the susceptibility of P. corruscans to E. ictaluri, as well as interspecies transmission of this bacterium.
