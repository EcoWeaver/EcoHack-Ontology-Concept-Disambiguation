Nonindigenous invertebrates in the periphyton and benthos of upper Volga reservoirs: A review
The mechanisms, ways, and traits of acclimatization of aquatic animals within and outside their historical ranges are reviewed. It is shown on the example of the upper Volga basin that formation still continues of the fauna in reservoirs that began after their impoundment during 1930s-1950s. It is also shown that Ponto-Caspian invaders and intentionally introduced Baikal amphipods play a great role in this process. The data on the traits of biological cycles of mass nonindigenous invertebrates in upper Volga reservoirs are presented. The main ecological factors facilitating expansion of new species in reservoirs are demonstrated. It is shown that the assessment of the functional role of dreissena in waterbodies should include determination of the abundance of the larvae of this species in plankton.
