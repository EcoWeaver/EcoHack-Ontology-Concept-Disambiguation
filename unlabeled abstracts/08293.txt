Relatedness and environment affect traits associated with invasive and noninvasive introduced Commelinaceae.
Understanding the traits of invasive species may improve the ability to predict, prevent, and manage invasions. I compared morphological and performance traits of five congeneric pairs of invasive and noninvasive Commelinaceae across a factorial experiment using a range of water and nutrient availabilities. Invasive species had greater fecundity and vegetative reproduction than their noninvasive relatives. The invasive species also had higher relative growth rates, greater specific leaf area, and more plastic root-to-shoot ratios than noninvasive species. However, whether a trait was associated with invasiveness often depended on both environment and relatedness. Invasives had greater sexual and vegetative reproduction, higher specific leaf area, and greater relative growth rates than noninvasive congeners, but only in some environments. Differences between invasive and noninvasive taxa were greatest at high nutrient availabilities. These results suggest that studies of invasive species' traits must incorporate information on conditions under which the trait was measured. In addition, incorporating information on relatedness improved our ability to detect associations between species traits, such as specific leaf area and relative growth rate, and invasiveness, suggesting that such information may be required for a complete understanding of what makes a species invasive.
