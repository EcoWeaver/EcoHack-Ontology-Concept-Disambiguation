Past anthropogenic influence on European forests and some possible genetic consequences
Present population structure and patterns of genetic diversity in forest trees have been influenced by past anthropogenic activities and the major aim of this review is to assess the scale and timing of this influence within Europe. Very little 'natural' forest (defined as areas that have not experienced a break in forest continuity because of cultural activities since conditions became suitable for tree growth) remains in Europe. Yet many contemporary European forests have developed by natural regeneration from local stock, so despite a massive anthropogenic impact, one can predict a survival of the 'natural' patterns of genetic diversity despite a general reduction in total diversity.
