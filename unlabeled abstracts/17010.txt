Recently introduced invasive geckos quickly reach population genetic equilibrium dynamics
Invasive species are spreading at high rates, yet fundamental processes allowing them to progress through the stages of invasion are unclear. The establishment stage is a critical point because this is when exotic species can survive, reproduce, and begin to spread. Unfortunately, inference of population dynamics during this stage may be impossible if historical and observational data are incomplete. Nonetheless, critical inferences on population dynamics during the establishment stage can be acquired indirectly by characterizing demographic history via the population genetics of recently introduced populations. Geckos have been introduced at a global scale and are one of the most successfully establishing families of alien reptile known. Here we conduct a series of population genetic analyses among five close subpopulations of the introduced Mediterranean gecko Hemidactylus turcicus. We tested for non-equilibrium genetic signatures, a pattern expected during early stages of invasion if there were few founders or repeated introductions led to population turnover. Genetic analyses showed no evidence of non-equilibrium dynamics such as genetic bottlenecks. Moreover, we found strong support for population genetic equilibrium dynamics. The observed results may have been generated via an introduction that involved high propagule pressure. However, given the life history of H. turcicus including generation time and dispersal potential, we favor the hypothesis that the invasive metapopulation has rapidly reached the establishment stage as indicated by relatively constant effective sizes and migration rates among introduced subpopulations. The ability to rapidly pass through the establishment stage may in part explain the invasion success of these geckos.
