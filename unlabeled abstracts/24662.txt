Zoobenthic diversity-gradients in the Baltic Sea: Continuous post-glacial succession in a stressed ecosystem
The Baltic Sea, formed after the latest glaciation, is an enclosed, low-saline, non-tidal ecosystem and has steep latitudinal and vertical gradients from sub-arctic conditions in the north to temperate in the south. The sea has undergone rapid changes since the glaciation, and the "ecological age" of the present ecosystem is only about 8000 years. Primary successional processes are still ongoing, and numerous ecological niches (e.g. large-bodied sediment bioturbators) remain available for immigration. The system is species-poor and vulnerable to the threat of exotic invasive species, and to date about 50 zoobenthic species have established populations in the Baltic Sea. The present biota is a mixture of species of different ecological and zoogeographical origin (marine to limnic; northern Arctic marine and limnic, to North Sea and Atlantic marine). The current distribution patterns of zoobenthos are illustrated, using marine, limnic and non-indigenous examples of structure and ecosystem functions. The species richness decreases from over 1600 marine benthic species in the open Skagerrak to about 500 in the western parts of the Baltic Sea, approximately 80 in the southern regions, to less than 20 in the northern regions. On the other hand, limnic species increase diversity in the inner reaches of the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia. Polychaetes, molluscs and echinoderms are dramatically reduced in numbers from the south to the north.
