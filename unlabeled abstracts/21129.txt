Trichoferus campestris(Faldermann) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), An Asian Wood-Boring Beetle Recorded in North America
Two adult specimens of Trichoferus campestris (Faldermann, 1835), a newly detected alien wood-boring beetle native to Asia (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), were collected in Repentigny, Quebec, Canada in 2002 and 2006. Adults, pupae, and mature larvae of this species are described, illustrated and diagnosed to facilitate its recognition among other North American Cerambycidae. The mtDNA sequence of the COI "barcoding" region of a Canadian specimen was obtained and analyzed. We discuss taxonomic affinities of T. campestris, its native distribution, host plants, and significance as a quarantine pest in North America. The importance of solid wood-packaging material as a potential pathway for invasive wood-boring species is highlighted. Seven other non-native Cerambycidae species first recorded in North America since 1980 [Tetropium fuscum (Fabricius, 1787), Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky, 1853), Tetrops praeusta (Linnaeus, 1758), Callidiellum rufipenne (Motschulsky, 1860), Phoracantha semipunctata (Fabricius, 1775), Phoracantha recurva Newman, 1842, and Sybra alternans (Wiedemann, 1825)] are briefly discussed.
