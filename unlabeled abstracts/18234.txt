Habitat and food utilization of the Siberian chipmunk, Tamias sibiricus, in Korea
Compared to European countries where the Siberian chipmunk (Tamias sibiricus) is an invasive species, there is a paucity of information on the ecology and natural history of Korean populations. T. sibiricus is a native species with large populations in Korea. We conducted field research during January to December 2012 in a forest habitat located in Hongcheon-gun, Gangwon-do (37deg 45' 50'' N, 127deg 50' 52'' E) in central Korea. We used both radio-tracking and capture-recapture techniques to determine home range size and nocturnal shelters. We also excavated and measured burrows and analyzed food items from caches. The mean 95 % of kernel home range size for males was 16,586 m2 (100 % of MCP = 14,129 m2) and 4,432 m2 (100 % of MCP = 4,512 m2) for females. Burrow systems typically had a nest, latrine, and food caches with tunnels. Nocturnal shelters were uncommon and co-habiting for summer sleeping and winter torpor were also rare. The primary food items in caches were chestnuts (77.0 %), Mongolian oak acorns (12.1 %), and bird's-foot trefoil (2.1 %). The information on the ecology and natural history of the Korean subspecies of Siberian chipmunks reported in this research shows significant differences from the ecological information for the subspecies in Hokkaido Japan.
