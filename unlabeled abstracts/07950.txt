Three introduced species of Mycetophilidae (Diptera: Sciaroidea) established in New Zealand
The presence of introduced fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) in New Zealand has gone largely unnoticed due to a lengthy period with little research on this group, and a lack of generalised collecting in urban areas. Leia arsona, Sciophila parviareolata, and S. ocreata are reported in New Zealand for the first time.The first two species are widespread in anthropogenic habitats and have been established for more than 20 years. The third species is known from a single urban locality, suggesting it is a more recent introduction.
