The Invasive Species Risk Assessment and Prediction System Based on GIS
With the international economic and trade exchanges, biological invasion has become an important factor in the threat of biological diversity and ecological environment. In order to prevent and control exotic species invasion, using of GIS-based geospatial technology to the potential distribution of invasive species risk assessment can provide the basis for ecological management of invasive alien species better, thus reducing the economic losses due to invasive alien species caused to our country. To this point, the study had done a secondary development based on ArcGIS Engine component. It used niche model to analysis and study potential suitable distribution of alien pests in China, conduct a risk assessment to them. The receiver operating characteristic curve was applied to access the prediction accuracy Analyzed the impact of the distribution of invasive alien species main environmental variables. It provided a theoretical basis for ecological management of invasive alien species.
