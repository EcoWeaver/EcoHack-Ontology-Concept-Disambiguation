Species introductions, diversity and disturbances in marine macrophyte assemblages of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea
In the process of species introduction, the traits that enable a species to establish and spread in a new habitat, and the habitat characteristics that determine the susceptibility to intro- duced species play a major role. Among the habitat characteristics that render a habitat resistant or susceptible to introductions, species diversity and disturbance are believed to be the most important. It is generally assumed that high species richness renders a habitat resistant to introductions, while disturbances enhance their susceptibility. In the present study, these 2 hypotheses were tested on NW Mediterranean shallow subtidal macrophyte assemblages. Data collection was carried out in early summer 2002 on sub-horizontal rocky substrate at 9 sites along the French Mediterranean coast, 4 undisturbed and 5 highly disturbed. Disturbances include cargo, naval and passenger har- bours, and industrial and urban pollution. Relationships between species richness (point diversity), disturbances and the number of introduced macrophytes were analysed. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) there is no relationship between species introductions, diversity and disturbance for the macrophyte assemblages; (2) multifactorial analyses only revealed the biogeographical relation- ships between the native flora of the sites.
