Germination ecology of invasive alien Anthemis cotula helps it synchronise its successful recruitment with favourable habitat conditions
Anthemis cotula is a widespread invasive alien species in Kashmir Himalaya. Being a winter annual, the species reproduces entirely by achenes and synchrony between germination requirements of the species and the habitat conditions must be of critical importance in its invasiveness. To examine how the achenes of different ages respond to different environmental cues, two laboratory experiments were performed wherein effects of different nitrogen applications and growth hormones under continuous light and dark conditions were explored. Results show that the achenes are positively photoblastic and have requirement for after-ripening. Nitrogen applied either as potassium nitrate or as thiourea significantly improved achene germination both under continuous light and dark conditions. Although kinetin (6-furfurylaminopurine) did not influence achene germination, gibberellic acid (GA3) applied at 1.0 mM concentration had the most significant effect on the final percentage germination under both light and dark conditions. These results suggest that the achenes have an elaborate mechanism of sensing the habitat conditions that helps them to synchronise their germination with favourable environmental conditions - a strategy that aids the species in ensuring recruitment, survival and its spread in Kashmir Himalaya.
