Chronology and causes of the extinction of the Lava Mouse,Malpaisomys insularis(Rodentia: Muridae) from the Canary Islands
AbstractUnderstanding late Holocene extinctions on islands requires accurate chronologies for all relevant events, including multiple colonisations by humans and the introduction of alien species. The most widely held hypothesis on the causes of Holocene island vertebrate extinctions incorporates human impacts, although climatic-related hypotheses cannot be excluded. Both hypotheses have been suggested to account for the extinction of the endemic Lava Mouse,Malpaisomys insularisfrom the Canary Islands. Here we present the first accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS)14C ages from collagen ofM. insularisbones from ancient owl pellets collected at Fuerteventura (Canary Islands, eastern Atlantic Ocean). These new dates contribute to an understanding of the extinction of this species. We are able to exclude climatic causes, predation by invasive species, and competition with the house mouse,Mus musculus. The arrival of Europeans in the Canary Islands correlates with the extinction ofMalpaisomys. The introduction of rats,Rattusspp., together with their parasites and diseases, emerges as the most reasonable hypothesis explaining the extinction ofM. insularis.
