Aphids and associated natural enemies on Ile Amsterdam and Ile Saint-Paul, Southern Indian Ocean
Ile Amsterdam (37 degrees 50'S, 77 degrees 30'E, 55 km(2)) and lie Saint-Paul (38 degrees 43'S, 77 degrees 31'E, 7 km(2)) are very isolated volcanic islands which were originally colonized by a few invertebrate fauna and flora. Invasive species richness has then increased along with human activity. A three-year monitoring programme (1997, 2000, 2001) and a summer campaign (2007) allowed species diversity, host plants, abundance and phenology of introduced aphids and natural enemies to be described. Seven cosmopolitan aphid species have been found on Ile Amsterdam (Aulacorthum solani, A. circumflexum, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, Myzus ascalonicus, M. cymbalariae, M. oranatus and Rhopalosiphum padi) and three on Ile Saint-Paul (A. solani, M. cymbalariae and R. padi). On Ile Amsterdam, these aphids were found on 28 host plants (out of 57 sampled plants), mainly introduced species. Phylica arborea was the only native plant much colonized by one aphid species, A. circumflexum. Aphids were mainly present on the base or in this vicinity. One Hymenopteran parasitoid, Aphidius matricariae, and two hyperparasites (Dendrocerus aphidum and Phaenoglyphis villosa), probably introduced along with their host, were collected. Aphid activity is very low during the autumn (March May) and at a maximum in spring and summer. Their density and diversity decrease with distance from the research station. From these results, the possible impact of aphids on native plants is discussed.
