Displacement of native Patagonian freshwater silverside populations (Odontesthes hatcheri, Atherinopsidae) by introgressive hybridization with introduced O. bonariensis
The Patagonian silverside Odontesthes hatcheri is a native fish restricted to streams and lakes of Patagonia (Argentina and Chile). Stocking programs to enhance recreational fisheries in man-made reservoirs have introduced a nonnative, closely-related species (the pejerrey O. bonariensis) in Patagonia almost a century ago, and yet little is known about the invasiveness of this species. To evaluate the impact of these introductions we analyze genetic data (microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA) to quantify the incidence of hybridization between these two species and assess potential effects on native population structure. Phylogeographic analyses reveal weak geographic differentiation among populations of O. hatcheri, in agreement with previous studies for other freshwater fishes in Patagonia strongly influenced by Quaternary glaciations and hydrographic basin changes since the last glaciation. However, many populations have unique genetic pools. In several areas, introductions resulted in extensive hybridization, with high frequencies of F2 and backcrossed hybrids in natural populations, and in some cases O. bonariensis has completely displaced the native populations. The negative impact of these introductions on native populations is correlated to temperature, a critical parameter in the face of global warming, suggesting that invasiveness of O. bonariensis may increase in the future. Our results advise against continuing stocking programs to preserve the integrity of natural populations of the Patagonian silverside.
