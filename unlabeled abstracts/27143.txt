A century of avifaunal turnover in a small tropical rainforest fragment
Despite the alarming rate of tropical deforestation, the long-term conservation value of forest fragments remains poorly understood. We report on the avifaunal turnover in an isolated 4 ha tropical forest fragment in Singapore (i.e. Singapore Botanic Gardens rainforest fragment (SBGRF)) between 1898 and 1998. Over 100 years, the SBGRF lost 18 (49%) species and gained 20 species. More forest-dependent species (3) were lost from the SBGRF than survived (1) or colonised it (no species). Conversely, significantly more introduced species (4) colonised the fragment than were previously recorded (1 species). Significantly more nectarivores survived (8 species) or colonised (9 species) than were lost (two species). In essence, while the avian species richness in the SBGRF remained relatively constant after a century, its species composition underwent significant changes. The avian species composition in the SBGRF in 1998 appeared to be more similar to that of the contemporary smaller and younger Singaporean secondary forest patches than to either the larger and older forest reserves or to the SBGRF 100 years ago. Our study suggests that small isolated tropical forest fragments may have limited long-term conservation value for native forest bird species.
