Competitive success of the invasive species, Hydrilla verticillata, over Vallisneria neotropicalis in nature could be linked to differences in nitrogen metabolism
Invasive species are considered the second most important threat to biodiversity, only behind habitat loss across all ecosystems. Although much of the work characterizing the competitive success of invasive species has identified life-history traits such as vigorous vegetative growth, long flowering times, and substantial seed yields, that are common to invaders, research has not clearly elucidated mechanisms driving invasion in all plant species. Hence, the objective of this work was to examine invasive and native submerged aquatic plants at the molecular, biochemical, and physiological levels to identify metabolic processes that mechanistically promote the competitive success of invasive species. This was done by studying nitrate uptake and assimilation in two submerged aquatic plant species, Hydrilla verticillata (L.F.) and Vallisneria neotropicalis (Marie-Vict.). Examination of nitrate uptake, nitrate reductase activity, glutamine synthetase activity, and expression of nitrate uptake and assimilation-related genes indicate that H. verticillata has a higher capacity to take up and assimilate nitrate than does V. neotropicalis throughout the growing season. From this work, it can be concluded that the invasive species, H. verticillata, has a superior competitive strategy through the majority of the growing season that relies on rapid uptake and assimilation of nitrate.
