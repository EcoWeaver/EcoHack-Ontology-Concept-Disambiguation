Non-Native Plant Invasion of the Hawaiian Islands
The Hawaiian Islands hold a unique geographic position that has resulted in plant species with remarkable evolutionary adaptations to island life as well as the highest proportion of plant endemism (90%) in the world. Polynesians and Europeans significantly reduced the extent of native vegetation types, and Europeans introduced non-native plants that have become highly invasive. The Hawaiian Islands have been extremely susceptible to invasion due to the fact that they are oceanic islands; they contain low intensities of competition; they have altered disturbance regimes; and a relatively short time has passed since non-native plant introductions, suggesting that the situation can only get worse. African grasses, Leucaena leucocephala, Psidium sp., Miconia calvescens, and Schinus terebinthifolius, are some of the most aggressive invasive plant species in the Hawaiian Islands. Species databases, remote sensing methods, and geographic information system analyses are currently being developed and will be extremely important for identifying the extent and threat of invasive plants. The three main methods of invasive plant removal include manual/mechanical removal, herbicide application, and biological controls. A number of federal, state, and non-profit organizations are involved with the management of invasive plant species in the Hawaiian Islands. However, much more attention must be paid to protecting some of the most unique and endangered ecosystems on the planet.
