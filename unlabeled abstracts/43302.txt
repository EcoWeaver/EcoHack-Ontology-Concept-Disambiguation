Comparative proteomics suggests the mode of action of a novel molluscicide against the invasive apple snail Pomacea canaliculata, intermediate host of Angiostrongylus cantonensis
Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a zoonotic parasitic nematode that is the most common cause of human eosinophilic meningitis. The invasive apple snail Pomacea canaliculata is an important intermediate host of A. cantonensis and contributes to its spread. P. canaliculata control will help prevent its invasion and transmission of A. cantonensis. The new molluscicide PBQ (1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)urea) exhibits great potency against P. canaliculata and has low toxicity against mammals and non-target aquatic organisms. We studied the mode of action of PBQ using TMT-based comparative quantitative proteomics analysis between PBQ-treated and control P. canaliculata snails. A total of 3151 proteins were identified, and 245 of these proteins were significantly differentially expressed with 135 downregulated and 110 upregulated. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses identified GO terms and KEGG pathways involved in de novo purine biosynthesis, ribosome components and translation process were significantly enriched and downregulated. The results indicated that PBQ treatment had substantial effects on the synthesis of genetic material, translation process, and protein synthesis of P. canaliculata and were likely the main cause of snail mortality.
