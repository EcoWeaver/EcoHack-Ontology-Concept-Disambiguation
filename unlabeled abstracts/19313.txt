Manufactured wood trade to Europe: a potential uninspected carrier of alien fungi
Sets of mangrove wood utensils shipped to Italy from China were found to be colonised by a number of fungal taxa. The fungi were found proliferating and sporulating on utensil surfaces after despatch to the market. The same taxa have been found to be present as asymptomatic infections in inner tissues. Most of the taxa were not pathogenic to plants, whereas one of the taxa was an isolate of the plant pathogenic species Fusarium oxysporum. The data presented in this manuscript provide clear evidence of how the hidden movement of fungi by the unrestricted trade in uninspected woody products should be considered a common and high risk pathway of invasion.
