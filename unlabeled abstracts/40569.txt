Potential of habitat complexity for mitigating interference competition between native and non-native salmonid species
This study aimed to confirm the mitigation effect of structurally complex habitat on interspecific interference competition between native and non-native salmonid species. We evaluated the effects of habitat complexity (number and size of aggregates of large woody debris and length of undercut banks) and other habitat components that were related to the local abundance of salmonids (dimension and mean depth of pool, mean particle size, and mean current velocity) on the local abundance of native white-spotted char ( Salvelinus leucomaenis (Pallas, 1814)) in allopatry and sympatry with non-native brown trout ( Salmo trutta L., 1758). The field survey was conducted in a Japanese montane stream. The number of char in pool habitats in the allopatric area correlated positively with habitat size, i.e., pool dimension. The number of char in the sympatric area with trout was positively correlated with habitat complexity, while it was negatively correlated with number of trout. In this study, we found that structurally complex habitats might be effective in mitigating interspecific competition between native white-spotted char and non-native brown trout in a montane stream.
