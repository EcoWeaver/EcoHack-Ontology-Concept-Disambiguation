Long-Term Persistence of Hawaii's Endangered Avifauna through Conservation-Reliant Management
One-third of the bird species listed under the US Endangered Species Act are endemic to Hawaii. One requirement of delisting a species is the elimination or abatement of threats to that species. More than 95% of Hawaii's threatened and endangered species face multiple threats that cannot be eliminated (e.g., alien mammalian predators, invasive alien plants that alter habitat structure, disease). However, because we can manage many of the threats at scales at which the achievement of recovery goals is possible, these species could be delisted if conservation partners committed to the implementation of stewardship agreements to maintain viable populations following those populations' delistings.
