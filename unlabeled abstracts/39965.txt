Understanding Factors that Correlate or Contribute to Exotic Russian-olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) Invasion at a Wildland-Urban Interface Ecosystem
AbstractUnderstanding the ecological distribution range of exotic trees in an arboreal ecosystem is essential to managing natural forest resources sustainably. Forest resource mapping can be applied as a powerful tool in the identification of forest resource threat patterns, and in monitoring ongoing changes associated with a landscape. This study offers an insight on Russian-olive and its impact on a spatially bound ecosystem, namely, Bismarck-Mandan Wildland-Urban Interface (BMWUI). Data from the National Agricultural Imagery Program collected in 2005 and 2010 and in situ reference data were used to estimate the potential habitat of Russian-olive using ArcGIS ArcInfo(r) 9.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA). Russian-olive plants are discernible on aerial photographs with a fine spatial resolution because of silvery gray-green leaves in the upper strata of their canopies. Results showed that Russian-olive occupied 110 ha (272 acres) in BMWUI in 2005 and of that, 13 ha (12%) was in inundated habitats. In addition, Russian-olive in 2010 covered 125 ha within the BMWUI and of that, 25 ha (20%) was in inundated habitats. Russian-olive showed a close association with the silt loam and silty clay soil type, which occurs along the Missouri River floodplain. Our findings revealed that the species is well established in riparian habitats and other open habitats such as roadside and agricultural lands. There is a greater likelihood of lateral spread of Russian-olive throughout the BMWUI that may require active management to avert undesirable conservation impacts.
