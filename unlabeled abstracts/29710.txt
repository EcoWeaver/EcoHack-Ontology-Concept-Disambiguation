Introduced taro (Colocasia esculenta) and yams (Dioscorea spp.) in Podtanean (2700-1800years BP) deposits from Me Aure Cave (WMD007), Moindou, New Caledonia
Plant microfossil analysis was carried out on deposits bearing Podtanean (2700-1800 years BP) ceramics from Me Aure Cave, Moindou, New Caledonia. Starch residues of introduced Colocasia esculenta, Dioscorea esculenta and one or more, undifferentiated Dioscorea species were identified. The latter include Dioscorea alata, D. bulbifera, D. nummularia and D. pentaphylla. The data provide the first direct evidence of prehistoric horticulture in New Caledonia. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
