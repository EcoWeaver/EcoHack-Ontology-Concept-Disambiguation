Insect cell endocytosis of chikungunya virus adapted to Aedes albopictus, a mosquito recently introduced into southern France.
Since the first isolation of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) more than 50 years ago in Eastern and Central Africa, CHIKV epidemics have been repeatedly recorded from various countries. The 2005-2006 outbreak in Reunion Island, was characterized by a genome microevolution in the E1 envelope glycoprotein gene (E1-A226V mutation) that enhances CHIKV fitness for Aedes Albopictus vector. More recently, CHIKV caused explosive outbreaks in India and propagated to temperate areas in Southern Europe, including France in 2010. Along with Aedes albopictus colonization of new geographical areas and climate change facilitating vector proliferation, the epidemic risk for "tropical infectious diseases" represents a real threat for naive populations. It is therefore important to better understand the replication cycle of CHIKV in cells from Aedes albopictus.
