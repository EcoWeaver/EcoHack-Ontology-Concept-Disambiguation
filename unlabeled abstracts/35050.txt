Secondary dispersal, spatial dynamics and effects of herbicides on reproductive capacity of a recently introduced population of Bromus sterilis in an arable field
An arable field was subdivided and subjected to either deep inversion ploughing or non-inversion cultivation after viable seeds of Bromus sterilis had been sown into oilseed rape stubble. After sowing in isolated plots distributed within the field, sequences of cropping treatments for the establishment of two successive winter wheat crops were applied. Each subfield was split into an uphill and a downhill direction for soil cultivation. The field had a 10deg slope. In the season following seed introduction, 2.6% of the introduced seeds had successfully germinated and established in the non-inversion cultivation regime, when no effective graminicide was applied. Ploughing eradicated B. sterilis. Using differential global positioning system (DGPS) mapping of the whole field population, emerged plants were observed up to 8.7 m (uphill treatment) and 21.3 m (downhill treatment) of their initial source. The median distance seeds were transported was 2.3 m uphill and 4.8 m downhill. Post-emergence application of the herbicide propoxycarbazone slightly reduced weed density and seed weight, and almost halved weed seed production. Application of fenoxaprop-P-ethyl was followed by higher density of plants, tillers and seeds of B. sterilis. Seed viability was unaffected by herbicide use. Thus, in the second wheat crop following seed rain, the weed population was dispersed more widely in the field, such that 20-30% of seeds were dispersed more than 5 m distance from the first year's foci of infestation. The relevance of soil cultivation to secondary dispersal of B. sterilis is discussed.
