The potential of marine live-bait introductions into oceanic islands
The likely introduction of non-indigenous species into the coastal ecosystems of oceanic islands through live-bait utilizations was studied. A store survey identified the species that are traded as live fishing-bait. Only Polychaeta species were identified as imported live-bait on Sao Miguel Island and all specimens were identified as Perinereis linea. Reponses to surveys of 77 anglers showed that: 44 % harvest from native sources, 44 % buy live-bait and 12 % do both; 56 % of the anglers' fish on a weekly basis; 31 % dispose of the bait into the sea. A field survey at five sites where fishing rods are routinely utilized was developed to investigate if the non-indigenous polychaetes sold as fishing-bait are already established in the natural environment of the Azores archipelago. Three species of Nereididae were identified: the native Neanthes nubila and P. oliveirae and the cryptogenic P. cultrifera. The escalating utilization of live-bait argues for a change in the habits of fishermen with respect to the discarding of leftover bait, as the higher the volume of discards the higher becomes the probability of non-indigenous species establishment successes, especially on oceanic islands characterized by vulnerable ecosystems with simpler trophic webs.
