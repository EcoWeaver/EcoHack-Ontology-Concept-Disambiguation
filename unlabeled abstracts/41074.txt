Ecological correlates of species' roles in highly invaded seed dispersal networks
Significance Species invasions and introductions are reshaping ecosystems around the world. In such novel ecological scenarios, it remains unclear whether crucial ecosystem functions played by lost native species may be partially or fully replaced by introduced species. We show that introduced plants and seed dispersers may take over interaction networks, playing key roles and governing network structure, with potential implications for its dynamics. The roles species play in novel networks are, however, defined by similar mechanisms that shape native-dominated communities. This indicates that the impacts of introduced species on invaded ecosystems can be anticipated based on ecological characteristics. Our results provide valuable recommendations for ecosystem management and restoration of increasingly degraded biological communities worldwide.
