Insect Eradication and Containment of Invasive Alien Species
Insect eradication programmes are nearly always targeted at recently arrived invasive species with significant pest potential. The programmes attempt to contain a pest to a defined area and then completely eliminate the pest from that area. From a Federal regulatory standpoint, eradication programmes are undertaken principally to maintain product marketability and market access or protect natural ecosystems. Eradication can also be an economical, long-term management option because later pest damage and control costs can be avoided. However, eradication efforts are a complex and expensive undertaking and as such, care must be taken in assessing the costs, benefits and likelihood of success before resources are committed. Rarely is eradication achieved using a single pest control tactic. Rather, an integrated approach using complementary tactics and targeting different life stages is recommended. The human dimension of an eradication programme also cannot be overlooked. Failure to work with the people affected by the pest or the control programme can lead to complications or programme failure. This Chapter briefly reviews issues to consider before implementing an insect eradication programme; the tactics that can be used/combined to facilitate eradication including chemical controls, pheromones and other semiochemicals, the sterile insect technique and biological control; and some of the trends and challenges for future eradication programmes. Examples from the Painted Apple Moth, Light Brown Apple Moth, Gypsy Moth, Cactus Moth, Codling Moth, False Codling Moth, Pink Bollworm, Salt Marsh Mosquito, New World Screwworm, Asian Longhorn Beetle, Boll weevil, and several fruit fly programmes are used to illustrate various points.
