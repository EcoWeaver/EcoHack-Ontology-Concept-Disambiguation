First record of the Chinese sleeper, Perccottus glenii Dybowski, 1877 (Actinopterygii: Odontobutidae) in the Dnieper Estuary, southern Ukraine (Black Sea drainage)
We present the first record of the Chinese sleeper (Perccottus glenii), an Asian invasive fish species, in the Dnieper Estuary, southern Ukraine. This new locality is clearly distant from all previous known localities in the Dnieper drainage. As the new finding is situated close to a fish pond outlet, we suggest one possible route of introduction to be fish transfer for aquaculture.
