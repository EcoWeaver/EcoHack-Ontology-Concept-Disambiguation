Biotic resistance and invasional meltdown: consequences of acquired interspecific interactions for an invasive orchid, Spathoglottis plicata in Puerto Rico
Invasiveness of non-native species often depends on acquired interactions with either native or naturalized species. A natural colonizer, the autogamous, invasive orchid Spathoglottis plicata has acquired at least three interspecific interactions in Puerto Rico: a mycorrhizal fungus essential for seed germination and early development; a native, orchid-specialist weevil, Stethobaris polita, which eats perianth parts and oviposits in developing fruits; and ants, primarily invasive Solenopsis invicta, that forage at extrafloral nectaries. We tested in field experiments and from observational data whether weevils affect reproductive success in the orchid; and whether this interaction is density-dependent. We also examined the effectiveness of extrafloral nectaries in attracting ants that ward off weevils. Only at small spatial scales were weevil abundance and flower damage correlated with flower densities. Plants protected from weevils had less floral damage and higher fruit set than those accessible to weevils. The more abundant ants were on inflorescences, the less accessible fruits were to weevils, resulting in reduced fruit loss from larval infections. Ants did not exclude weevils, but they affected weevil activity. Native herbivores generally provide some biotic resistance to plant invasions yet Spathoglottis plicata remains an aggressive colonizer despite the acquisition of a herbivore/seed predator partly because invasive ants attracted to extrafloral nectaries inhibited weevil behavior. Thus, the invasion of one species facilitates the success of another as in invasional meltdowns. For invasive plant species of disturbed habitats, having ant-tended extrafloral nectaries and producing copious quantities of seed, biotic resistance to plant invasions can be minimal.
