Fish recolonization of a lowland river with non-buffered storm water discharges but with abated pollution from a large municipality
Water pollution from industrial Metro Lodz (ML), Poland, made the Ner River almost fishless in its middle-lower course for most of the 19th and 20th century. The new sewage treatment plant of ML and reduction of industry have caused pollution abatement there since the 1990s. As a result, the Ner became repopulated, which was shown by fish samples collected along its course in 2000-2012. Multivariate statistical methods helped distinguish unpolluted (I and II, in the upper course), and recovered (III, IV and V, in the middle-lower course) sections of the river. Historical and present data indicated that section III (downstream of ML) recovered least, both before and during the study. Section V (outflow one) recovered most and its fish fauna (almost exclusively native) now displays high and stable biomass, abundance and species richness, including those of obligatory riverine species. Non-native Prussian carp's dominance followed the river degradation gradient, i.e. was highest in section III, and in section V declined to almost absence. This study shows that the revival of native fish fauna seems to be a method of restricting the dominance of this highly tolerant species. Despite the abatement, storm events are very harmful to fish (mostly in section III), because the Ner discharge may then increase manifold and all storm water is drained by the ML combined sewer system to the Ner in several hours. Other stressors are numerous dams and desorption of pollutants from sediment in the middle Ner, and perhaps pollutant inflow from agriculture or local urban areas. Some moderation of storm impact on water entering the Ner from ML by constructing buffer reservoirs would probably cause further fish recovery in section III.
