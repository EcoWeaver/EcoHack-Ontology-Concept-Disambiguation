Suitability of five mealybug species (Hemiptera, Pseudococcidae) as hosts for the solitary parasitoidAnagyrussp. nr.pseudococci(Girault) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae)
Anagyrus sp. nr.pseudococci is an endoparasitoid which has been used as a biological control agent of mealybug pests. In this study, we compared the suitability of five mealybugs species with different phylogenetic relationships and geographical origins as hosts of this parasitoid. The selected mealybugs were: i) a Mediterranean native species, Planococcus ficus, sharing a long co-evolutionary history with the parasitoid; ii) three exotic species, the Afrotropical Pl. citri, the Australasian Pseudococcus calceolariae and the Neotropical Ps. viburni, with a recent history; and iii) the Neotropical Phenacoccus peruvianus, with no previous common history with the parasitoid. Host suitability was assessed based on different fitness parameters, such as body size, developmental time, emergence rate, and sex ratio. The parasitoid was able to complete development in all mealybug species. Nevertheless, its emergence rate significantly varied among mealybug species, with the highest values observed in Pl. ficus and Pl. citri, intermediate values in Ps. calceolariae, and the lowest ones in Ps. viburni and Ph. peruvianus. The body size of adult wasp females varied with host suitability and was positively correlated with other measures of parasitoid fitness, including the emergence rate and sex-ratio. The parasitoid developmental time differed among mealybug species, but did not correlate with any other measure of fitness. A female biased sex ratio was found in the parasitoid progeny emerged from all mealybug species, except in Ps. viburni and Ph. peruvianus. There was a direct relationship between the proportion of females in the parasitoid progeny and the emergence rate.
