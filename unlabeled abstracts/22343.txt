Long-term food web change in Lake Superior
Restoration and rehabilitation of native species in the Laurentian Great Lakes is a priority for fisheries management agencies. Restoration efforts are increasingly incorporating a perspective that considers species within a broader food web context. We used stable isotope analysis and museum-preserved specimens to describe and quantify 100 years of food web changes in the Lake Superior fish community. We validated stable isotope analysis of museum specimens by showing a positive correlation between isotope- and diet-based estimates of trophic position. While introductions have created a more trophically diverse food web than historically found in Lake Superior, two separate metrics revealed little community-wide change in the food web. Our species-specific analysis revealed trophic niche differences between shortjaw (Coregonus zenithicus) and shortnose (Coregonus reighardi) ciscoes, two species previously argued to be indistinguishable based on morphological characteristics. By providing a historical context, our findings show the ability of the Lake Superior food web to accommodate non-native species introductions over the last century while still supporting native species populations. This long-term information about food web structure can help guide management and restoration goals in Lake Superior. Furthermore, Lake Superior can serve as a basis for comparing food web changes in other, more highly altered Great Lakes.
