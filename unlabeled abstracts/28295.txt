Invasive Sap-Sucker Insects in the Mediterranean Basin
The chapter provides information on 15 species of invasive sacking insects on forest trees in the Mediterranean basin. Four Psyllids and one Thaumastocorid bug develop on Eucalyptus spp. and are native to Australia, although all of them possibly arrived in the Mediterranean area via South America. Among the five Cinara spp. those which develop on cedar trees spread inside the Mediterranean area, two of the aphids are North American species and one is probably from China. The discussed scale insects, two Matsucoccus spp. and Marchalina hellenica extent their range inside the Mediterranean basin. Finally, we report on two tingid species (Corythucha spp.) both originate from North America. We review their biology, the injury they inflect, their spread, as well as their natural enemies and the required management.
