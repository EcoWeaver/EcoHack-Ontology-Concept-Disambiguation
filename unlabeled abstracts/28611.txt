Resource partitioning between pelagic coregonids in a subarctic watercourse following a biological invasion
If a pelagic ecosystem is invaded by an efficient planktivorous fish, competition theory predicts that habitat and/or diet segregation should occur if the invader and native planktivores are to co-exist. We compared the diet and pelagic habitat use between invading vendace (Coregonus albula) and two native morphs of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) in three subarctic lakes located within the same watercourse. No clear vertical habitat segregation was found as vendace prevailed throughout the entire depth range. Zooplankton generally dominated the diet of all three coregonids. No obvious resource partitioning was found in two of the lakes, while in the third lake the diets of whitefish and vendace differed significantly from each other. Here, the predominant pelagic whitefish morph fed extensively on water mites whereas vendace mainly consumed surface insects and to some extent small fish, apparently as a result of highly depleted zooplankton resources. The results suggest that various levels of resource depletion following the vendace invasion caused the observed differences between the lakes, indicating that different levels of resource partitioning were associated with dissimilar competition intensities. At present, coexistence of these congeneric species seems to be possible, although the vendace invasion has apparently resulted in a challenging and unstable situation for the planktivorous whitefish.
