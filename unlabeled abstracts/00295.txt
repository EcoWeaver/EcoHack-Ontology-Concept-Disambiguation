Effects of Soil Resources on Plant Invasion and Community Structure in Californian Serpentine Grassland
Fertilization with N and P increased biomass of the resident vegetation substantially in the first season, and within 2 yr allowed the invasion and dominance of non-native annual grasses in patches originally dominated by native annual forbs. Species richness declined with fertilization, as the increased biomass production by invaders suppressed some native forbs. Increased macronutrient availability can increase production on serpentine-derived soil, even when other serpentine characteristics (such as low Ca/Mg ratios and high heavy-metal concentrations) have not been mitigated. -from Authors
