Initial detections and spread of invasive Spodoptera frugiperda in China and comparisons with other noctuid larvae in cornfields using molecular techniques
The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, is a species native to the Americas and has spread to many countries in Africa and Asia in recent years. Proactive actions for potential invasion of S. frugiperda to China coordinated by government agencies and agricultural extension systems resulted in timely detection in January 2019 in Yunnan Province neighboring to Myanmar. The extensive monitoring in southern provinces of China since February 2019 resulted in dynamic tracking of the S. frugiperda spreading to 13 provincial regions in China within four months by May 10, 2019, which is crucial for timely management actions in the fields. The first detections of S. frugiperda (corn strain) in China were confirmed using cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) and triosephosphate isomerase (Tpi) genes molecular marker method. In addition to S. frugiperda, larvae of three other noctuid species with similar morphological appearance (S. litura, S. exigua and Mythimna separata) can occur simultaneously and cause similar damage in cornfield in southern China. Thus, we can use both morphological and molecular marker methods to compare larval stages of four noctuid species. Further, we discussed the risk of potential spread of invasive S. frugiperda to other regions and impact on corn production in China. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved
