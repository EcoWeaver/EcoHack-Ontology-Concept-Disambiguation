The herbicides glyphosate and 2,4-D are the most applied worldwide. These herbicides are often found in surface waters close to agricultural areas. This study aims at evaluating the chronic effects caused by glyphosate + 2,4-D mixture in Boana faber and Leptodactylus latrans tadpoles. The combined solution of the glyphosate and 2,4-D, in 5 different concentrations, was applied for 168 hours. Herbicide mixtures did not affect the survival of the exposed tadpoles but growth and swimming activity were altered; besides causing several damages in the mouth and intestine. The erythrocytes showed micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities. There is an ecological risk in the exposure of tadpoles of B. faber and L. latrans from the mixture of glyphosate + 2,4-D. Therefore, the approach used in this study provides important information on how commonly used pesticides can affect non-target organisms.
