New Records of Native and Introduced Weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) for Nova Scotia from Cape Breton Island
Eleven species of weevils native to North America, Acalyptus carpini (Herbst), Tachyerges ephippiatus (Say), Bagous transversus LeConte, Ceutorhynchus omissus Fall, Ceutorhynchus squamatus LeConte, Auleutes nebulosus (LeConte), Perigaster liturata (Dietz), Stethobaris ovata (LeConte), Carphonotus testaceus Casey, Rhyncolus brunneus Mannerheim and Pissodes fiskei Hopkins, and seven species introduced to North America, Sitophilus oryzae (Linnaeus), Sitophilus granarius (Linnaeus), Gymnetron pascuorum (Gyllenhal), Gymnetron tetrum (Fabricius), Tychius meliloti Stephens, Phyllobius oblongus (Linnaeus), and Polydrusus sericeus (Schaller) are reported for the first time in Nova Scotia based on specimens from Cape Breton Island. New records for native species reflect increased collecting and attention to the fauna of Nova Scotia. Historically, many introduced insects first established populations in North America in the Canadian Maritimes and in fact about 40% of the species listed in the most recent checklist of weevils are introduced. The introduced species new to Nova Scotia reported here apparently established populations elsewhere and subsequently expanded their ranges into Nova Scotia.
