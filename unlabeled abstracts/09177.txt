Will the crab Hemigrapsus penicillatus invade the coasts of Europe?
A crab previously unknown in the European fauna was discovered in La Rochelle (France) in 1994. This shore crab was identified as Hemigrapsus penicillatus, a North-West Pacific species. It appears to be spreading rapidly. It has now been detected from Laredo, Spain (43 deg25'N, 03 deg20'W) to Fromentine, France (46deg53'N, 02deg09'W) in sheltered areas of the mid-littoral zone. It is locally abundant, with a density of up to 10-20 individuals per square metre. In its native area, its distribution ranges from a cold (northern Japan, south of the Pacific coast of Russia) to a tropical (Taiwan, Hong-Kong) habitat. Being tolerant to both high and low temperatures (even at freezing point), it will probably colonize most of the European and North-African coasts within a short period of time.
