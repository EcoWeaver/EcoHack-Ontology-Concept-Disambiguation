First record of the invasive North American gastropod Ferrissia fragilis (Tryon, 1863) from the Pripyat River basin, Belarus
The invasive North American gastropod Ferrissia fragilis (Tryon, 1863) has been recorded for the first time in August 2007 at three sites on the Pripyat River basin (the Belarusian part of the inland European "central invasion corridor"). This species occurs in the onshore shallow zone (depth 0.2-0.3 m) with dense aquatic vegetation and temperature from 21.8 to 23.7degC. Maximal abundances of this species have been observed in Mykashevichy port bay. Most likely, this invasive gastropod entered the River Pripyat basin from the Ukrainian territory where it was found early in cooling reservoir of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station; however invasion pathways through the western (Poland) and ornamental trade are also likely.
