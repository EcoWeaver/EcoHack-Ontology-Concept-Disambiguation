Order of inoculation affects the success of co-invading entomopathogenic fungi
The effect of order of inoculation of Pandora blunckii and Zoophthora radicans co-infecting Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) was investigated. After co-inoculation, the proportion of larvae infected by either species was greatly reduced compared to when they were inoculated singly. The order of inoculation influenced the final outcome; the isolate inoculated last always killed more larvae than the isolate inoculated first.
