Linkages of flow regime and micro-topography: prediction for non-native mangrove invasion under sea-level rise
Flow regime is a key driver of invasive aquatic organisms, and the invasiveness of mangrove species may be simultaneously attributed to plant traits and flowing hydrological conditions at the estuary scale. Sonneratia apetala is a non-native forestry mangrove species in China with a potential for dispersal and invasion. We focused on hydrological drivers, topographic conditions and their co-effects on the species' invasiveness in Zhangjiang Estuary of Fujian, China. A hydrological model and a micro-topographic model were used to predict its dispersal and early establishment, and field surveys and simulated experiments were integrated to estimate its future dispersal patterns. The mesohaline mudflat with a salinity of 8~10 PSU at the mangrove seaward edge was the most likely colonization area for S. apetala under current conditions. The south-western region of the estuary with native mangroves was the most likely area for its colonization according to the unstructured-grid finite-volume community ocean model (FVCOM) in September, when the largest tidal currents within a year and the maximum fruit maturity period occur. Moreover, approximately 42% of the mudflats throughout the whole estuary may be available for seedling establishment under the future sea-level rise (SLR) RCP 4.5 scenarios compared with 44% for current establishment; however, the RCP 8.5 scenarios would significantly decrease seedling establishment by 2100 due to serious tidal inundation according to the micro-topographical model. This study provides a conceptual framework for mangrove invasion for local-scale biological invasion modelling at a fine resolution by linking plant traits, flow regime and micro-topography.
