Crematogaster subdentata Mayr, 1877, a potentially invasive species of ant (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) new to the fauna of crimea
A population of a new to Crimea and potentially invasive ant species, Crematogaster subdentata Mayr, 1877, has been found in Mikhailovka Village of Saki District (the Crimean Peninsula). The species may have been introduced to Crimea from Central Asia. The study addresses the ecology and behavior of C. subdentata that inhabits the newly invaded region, including the time-dependent density of its colonies, the structure of foraging areas, the daily activity cycle, and control measures. The invasion began 9-12 years ago. There are 4 settlements discovered that differ in their age and the structure of the foraging area. C. subdentata can be considered a potentially dangerous invader that is capable of doing significant damage to the biocenoses of forests, parks, and gardens, as well as to wooden buildings.
