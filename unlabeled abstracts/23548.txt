Occurrence of the exotic leafcutter beeMegachile (Eutricharaea) concinna(Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) in southern South America. An accidental introduction?
Here we report for the first time the presence of the exotic leafcutter bee Megachile (Eutricharaea) concinna in South America, based on specimens collected in the northeast part of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. We believe that M. concinna accidentally entered the country probably together with the introduction of M. rotundata to different regions of the country for commercial purposes since the 1970's. A diagnosis, illustrations, flowers records, and nesting data are given
