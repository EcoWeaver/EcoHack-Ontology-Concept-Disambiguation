Checklist of indigenous and adventive bark and ambrosia beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae) of New Zealand and interceptions of exotic species (1952-2000)
A review of the New Zealand Scolytinae and Platypodinae has been carried out, revealing a relatively small fauna of at least 19 indigenous Scolytinae, of which 9 species are currently undescribed, and four Platypodinae. Despite the frequent interception of exotic species in imported timber and wooden items, there are only 11 introduced Scolytinae, primarily of Australian and European origin.We provide numerous corrections of incorrect synonyms and records of occurrence in New Zealand, and a new combination, Hypocryphalus longipennis (Browne), transferred from Cryphalus, is proposed. For each species we provide its known distribution and host plants in New Zealand. None of the indigenous species are economically important in New Zealand. Of the introduced species, only Hylurgus ligniperda (Fabricius) and Hylastes ater (Paykull), which breed primarily in woody debris available in pine plantations, are abundant, but their economic impact is limited. As a vector of Dutch elm disease, Scolytus multistriatus (Marsham) could potentially have a large economic impact, although the results of a disease eradication campaign are promising. Ninety Scolytinae species and eight Platypodinae have been intercepted in shipments to New Zealand from 1952-2000, with imports of timber and other wood products being the primary pathway. Many interceptions included live specimens but, despite this, the large majority of species have not become established.
