Reproduction success of the invasive Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea 1834) in relation to native mussel species
Invasions of non-native species are major threats for freshwater ecosystems. One of the most invasive freshwater mussels in Europe is the Asian Sinanodonta woodiana (Chinese pond mussel). It occurs in the same waterbodies as the endangered native species Anodonta cygnea and Anodonta anatina with unknown consequences for them. Thus, the analysis about the host-parasite relationship between the larvae of S. woodiana and host fish species in Europe is important to assess impacts on the native mussels regarding their competition for hosts. In this study, host suitability of ten different fish species (native and non-native to Europe) for the glochidia of S. woodiana was analyzed by simultaneous infestation of the fish. All fish species were identified as suitable hosts but differed significantly in initial infestation rate as well as duration and rate of juvenile mussel excystment. Surprisingly, the glochidia developed successfully on Rhodeus amarus (bitterling), which cannot use S. woodiana for its own reproduction, and which is an unsuitable host for native anodontines. Compared to both native Anodonta, S. woodiana glochidia developed more successfully resulting in a higher number of excysted juvenile mussels at similar larval exposure. Metamorphosis was also faster on all tested fish species. These factors, together with the faster growth and higher number of offspring in S. woodiana likely contribute to a competitive advantage over native anodontines. The great likelihood of spreading this mussel on a large number of different possible host fish species deserves attention in fisheries management and stocking programs.
