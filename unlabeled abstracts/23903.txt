Current status of Ireland's newest invasive species - the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774)
The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea was first discovered in Ireland in the Rivers Barrow and Nore in 2010. Scuba diving surveys were the primary sampling method used to determine the detailed distribution of this species in the two rivers. Sustainable populations of Asian clam were present in the tidal freshwater reaches of both rivers. No clams were present upstream of the tidal limit. A maximum density of 9,636 individuals m -2 was recorded in the River Barrow. This paper presents some basic metrics in relation to the populations present in these two connected river systems.
