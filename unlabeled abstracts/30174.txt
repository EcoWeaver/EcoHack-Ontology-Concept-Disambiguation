The Exotic Origins of Fishes Depicted on Prehistoric Mimbres Pottery from New Mexico
A variety of fishes is depicted on Classic Mimbres figurative pottery of ca. A.D. 950-1150. Bowl paintings show fishing scenes and equipment. We have tentatively identified depictions of 20 fish taxa, 18 of which are of marine origin. The suite of species suggests a provenience in the Gulf of California, near Guaymas, Sonora. Mimbres traders apparently traveled 1,500 km from New Mexico's Mimbres Valley to the Gulf and back, probably to obtain shells and other materials for home use and for commerce.
