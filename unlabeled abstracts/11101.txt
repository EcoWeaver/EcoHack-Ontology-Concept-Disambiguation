Growth and competition in a warmer ocean: a field experiment with a non-native and two native habitat-building seaweeds
Kelps and fucoids are important parts of temperate seaweed communities, but may be negatively impacted by climate change and non-native species. We used a field experiment to investigate the effect of higher temperatures and a non-native seaweed, Sargassum muticum, on the kelp Saccharina latissima and fucoid Fucus serratus. All three are canopy-forming species which may grow together in the infralittoral and upper sublittoral zones in southwestern Norway. Artificial assemblages with different combinations of the species were placed in the shallow sublittoral, and length changes, weight changes and survival of the thalli were measured. This was done over a hot summer and again over a cool summer. The results showed that the species and their competitive interactions were affected by the different thermal conditions. Saccharina latissima was the most successful species in the cool summer and had an impact on the other two species, but it was strongly negatively affected by the hot summer. Under these conditions, Fucus serratus became the most successful species, gaining the most weight. Compared to intraspecific competition, the non-native Sargassum muticum had no additional influence on the native species, and at the end of both summers it was in poor condition. Low seawater nutrients, resulting in low internal nitrogen, are hypothesised as a potential cause of this.
