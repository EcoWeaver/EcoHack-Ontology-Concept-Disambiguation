Molecular analysis of predation by carabid beetles (Carabidae) on the invasive Iberian slugArion lusitanicus
AbstractThe invasive Iberian slug,Arion lusitanicus, is spreading through Europe and poses a major threat to horticulture and agriculture. Natural enemies, capable of killingA. lusitanicus, may be important to our understanding of its population dynamics in recently invaded regions. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study predation onA. lusitanicusby carabid beetles in the field. A first multiplex PCR was developed, incorporating species-specific primers, and optimised in order to amplify parts of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene of largeArionslugs, includingA. lusitanicusfrom the gut contents of the predators. A second multiplex PCR, targeting12S rRNAmtDNA, detected predation on smallerArionspecies and the field slugDeroceras reticulatum.Feeding trials were conducted to measure the effects of digestion time on amplicon detectability. The median detection times (the time at which 50% of samples tested positive) forA. lusitanicusandD. reticulatumDNA in the foreguts ofCarabus nemoraliswere 22 h and 20 h, respectively. Beetle activity-densities were monitored using pitfall traps, and slug densities were estimated using quadrats. Predation rates on slugs in the field byC. nemoralisin spring ranged from 16-39% (beetles positive for slug DNA) and were density dependent, with numbers of beetles testing positive being positively correlated with densities of the respective slug species.Carabus nemoraliswas shown to be a potentially important predator of the alienA. lusitanicusin spring and may contribute to conservation biological control.
