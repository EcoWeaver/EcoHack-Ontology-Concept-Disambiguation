The current distribution and potential for future range expansion of feral ferret Mustela putorius furo in Ireland
Predicting the potential invaded range of a non-native species is an important tool for conservation biology. The ferret (Mustela putorius furo) is a known invasive species outside its native range and has recently been confirmed as a feral species in Ireland. To determine the current distribution of feral populations, an all-island survey was conducted during 2006-2008. Using the results of this survey, a landscape modelling approach, using presence-only data was applied to predict the potential future range of this species in Ireland, given the availability of suitable habitat. The results suggest that Ireland appears to be potentially highly suitable for ferrets and, therefore, the possible ecological impacts of this species in Ireland are discussed.
