Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis (Carriere) J. Houzeau) invasion affects soil phosphorus dynamics in adjacent coniferous forests in subtropical China
The invasion of moso bamboo ( Phyllostachys edulis (Carriere) J. Houzeau) into neighboring Cryptomeria japonica (L. f.) D. Don plantations significantly altered soil P status and dynamics. This alteration in phosphorus dynamics must be considered when assessing the ecological consequence of moso bamboo invasion in subtropical China.
