First record of the Australian guava moth Coscinoptycha improbana Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Carposinidae) in New Caledonia: Implication for quarantine and biosecurity surveys in insular territories
We recorded the Australian guava moth for the first time in New Caledonia. Given its biology and recent spread into New Zealand, this moth may be a pest risk for many fruit crops and native plant species if it is proved to have been introduced in New Caledonia. Indeed, this record challenges our capabilities to identify insect interceptions in the context of a high gap of taxonomic knowledge in New Caledonia. It also urges high endemism islands to implement early detection protocols to prevent establishment and spread of new invasive species.
