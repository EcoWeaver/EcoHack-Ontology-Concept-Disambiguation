The failure of the introduction of wild boar Sus scrofa in the island of Cyprus: a case study
Wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) were introduced in the island of Cyprus in 1990, when five animals were imported from Greece for game farming. In 1994, wild boars were illegally released in Lemesos (Limassol) Forest and in 1996 in the Troodos National Forest Park. Soon the population increased and dispersed throughout the park. In 1997, the government of Cyprus decided to eradicate wild boar because of the danger of transmitting diseases to livestock and to prevent possible environmental destruction. To control the wild boar, hunting was permitted and game wardens were instructed to eliminate the free-ranging animals. In 2004, no animals were observed in localities where they had been seen before. Surveys in September 2004 (Troodos National Park) and January/February 2005 (Troodos Forest, Pafos Forest, and Lemesos Forest) revealed no signs of recent wild boar presence. The reasons for the possible failure of wild boar to establish in Cyprus are discussed.
