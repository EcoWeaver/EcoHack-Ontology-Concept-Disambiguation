Effect of nitrogen, water and neighbor density on the growth of Hesperis matronalis and two native perennials
Disturbance is a well-recognized catalyst of exotic species invasion, depriving or releasing resources into communities and favoring the spread of some invaders. Hesperis matronalis (dame's rocket) is widespread in North America and has potential to become a major problem in natural communities due to anthropogenic influences. We used a target-neighbor design in a greenhouse to grow H. matronalis and native seedlings (Campanula rotundifolia and Muhlenbergia montana) at various levels of neighbor density, nitrogen and water. H. matronalis clearly reduced C. rotundifolia and M. montana aboveground growth and maintained its competitive advantage across all treatments. We expected H. matronalis to maximize its growth and have the greatest negative effect on native species under high resource conditions because ruderal species are able to take advantage of excess resources. H. matronalis demonstrated a clearly negative effect on native species, but a particular ability to outcompete native species at high resource levels depended on resource and native species identity. We also expected that the native species would not exploit excess resources as well as H. matronalis, instead growing better under ambient or low resource conditions because of local adaptation. Rather, M. montana benefited from high water inputs, inconsistent with plant strategies characteristic of stress tolerators. Information on the effects of H. matronalis on native plants in a controlled setting may aid land managers to understand its potential effects in natural communities.
