Lipid characteristics and essential minerals of native Turkish hazelnut varieties (Corylus avellana L.)
Five native hazelnut varieties from Turkey, namely, prime quality Tombul variety, and second grade quality Yassi Badem, Sivri, Karafindik, and Ham varieties were examined for their lipid characteristics (triacylglycerol, tocopherol, tocotrienol, phytosterol, and phytostanol composition) and 12 essential minerals. Among 12 triacylglycerols separated in all hazelnut varieties, OOO (61.0-77.5%) and OOL (10.5-22.8%) were the main components (where O = oleoyl and L = linoleoyl). Seven tocol isoforms (four tocopherols and three tocotrienols), seven phytosterols, as well as cholesterol, and one phytostanol were positively identified and quantified; among these, a-tocopherol and b-sitosterol were predominant in all hazelnut oils. Hazelnut varieties served as an excellent source of copper and manganese. Consumption of the recommended daily amount of 42.5 g of hazelnut from different varieties provides 44.4-83.6% of copper and 40.1-448% of recommended manganese intake for adults. These results suggest that second grade quality hazelnut varieties were as good sources of functional lipids and essential minerals as was prime quality Tombul hazelnut, with some exceptions (P < 0.05).
