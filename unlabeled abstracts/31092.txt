InBUy database of Invasive and Alien Species (IAS) in Uruguay: a useful tool to confront this threat to biodiversity
In Uruguay, as well as in other regions of the world, IAS cause negative impacts on natural and managed ecosystems. The use of databases is a helpful tool to elaborate different strategies for prevention and control, and to develop policies and scientific analyses related to IAS. The database of IAS in Uruguay (InBUy) was developed during two time periods (2006-2007 and 2009-2010). It currently contains information on 33 specialists of different taxonomic groups, 14 research projects, 185 references, 351 species and 4,715 records, with vascular plants having both the highest number of species and records. Among vascular plants, herbaceous life forms are the most strongly represented, followed by trees and shrubs. Within animals, the fishes and mollusks are the most important groups. Analysis of the native distribution areas of IAS showed that most are indigenous from Europe, followed by Asia and Oceania. Data showed that introductions of IAS into Uruguay are mainly intentional (67%), so efforts should be focused on policies and rules in order to control the entrance of exotic organisms and prevent new invasions. The geography of the compiled dataset shows the main impact is along the coastline, where the highest exotic species richness and records occurs, and also the most biological invasions. The InBUy database is up-to-date and has successfully contributed to the creation of an official IAS list for Uruguay and both a National and a Coastal Geographic Information System. It has also been used for developing consciousness about this important threat to biodiversity, at both national and regional scales.
