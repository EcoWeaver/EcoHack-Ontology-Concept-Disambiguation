An experimental test of colonization ability in the potentially invasive Didemnum perlucidum (Tunicata, Ascidiacea)
Exotic species invasions are one of the greatest threats to marine systems and ascidians have many characteristics that favor transport, colonization and establishment into new regions. Didemnum perlucidum is a widespread species that has been introduced into tropical ports around the world. Here we examine the colonizing ability of D. perlucidum by experimental use of artificial plates in a shellfish culture. The experiment comprised paired plates for colonization (bare and occupied) in 16 monthly replicates. Recruitment and space occupation were compared between bare and occupied plates and an estimation of reproductive effort was based on the number of larvae produced in each of ten colonies collected on the culture structures. D. perlucidum reproduced continuously but greatest reproduction occurred between December 2006 and May 2007. While recruitment was somewhat greater (number of new colonies) on bare plates, this species can colonize already occupied substrates and, surprisingly, colony area was always similar between treatments. Thus, while fewer colonies formed on occupied plates, once formed, colonies grew at rates similar to those on clean plates. Thus, D. perlucidum colonizes substrates very efficiently, especially when unoccupied space is available.
