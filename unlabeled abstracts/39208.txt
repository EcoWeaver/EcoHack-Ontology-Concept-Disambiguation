Effects of urbanization-climate interactions on range expansion in the invasive European pavement ant
Global changes, such as climate and urbanization, are strongly entwined and aggravated by the development of human activities, which also intensifies the human-mediated dispersal of species. However, few studies have explicitly considered the combined influence of urbanization and climate on species expansion. We investigated the combined roles of climate, urbanization and human-mediated dispersal in the expansion of Tetramorium immigrans (an invasive pavement ant in North America) in urban areas of South-eastern France. A total of 544 T. immigrans individuals were sampled from 16 urban gradients and genotyped at 14 microsatellite markers. Based on molecular ecology methods and statistical modelling, we evaluated the impact of climate and urbanization on its distribution patterns. Through the combined study of the occurrence probabilities of T. immigrans, its genetic structure and the founder effects within its populations, the effect of climate-urbanization interaction on species distribution was clearly evidenced, suggesting that in the north of its range, T. immigrans subsists under harsher climate by colonizing the most urbanized areas. Many taxa may conform to such pattern, making the combined study of climate and urbanization a necessary challenge for future studies. Distribution patterns concurred with similar observations in the American invasive range of T. immigrans, making it likely that it may not be native to the northernmost part of its European range. Cryptic invasions or discreet range shifts in response to increasing urbanization are likely to occur in many taxa, especially in ants, and deserve increased attention from researchers and managers alike.
