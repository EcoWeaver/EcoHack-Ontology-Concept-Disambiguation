Brazilian native species as potential new sources of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial agents
The antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of extracts of 12 plant species growing in Brazil were determined. Antimicrobial activity against 12 food-related bacterial species was studied using the disc-diffusion, MIC, and MBC methods. Campomanesia eugenioides extract was the most active against the tested Gram-positive bacteria, whereas Parapiptadenia rigida bark extract presented the highest activity against the evaluated Gram-negative bacteria (MIC and MBC of 0.075 and 0.62 mg ml-1, respectively, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Those two extracts also presented high phenolic content and high DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging ability. C. eugenioides extract presented high Fe2+ chelating capacity. The results of the present study demonstrate that, among the evaluated extracts, P. rigida bark and C. eugenioides, both Brazilian native species, presented the highest potential of application as natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agents. .
