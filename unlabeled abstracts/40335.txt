Effects of Spartina alterniflora Invasion on the Abundance and Community of Meiofauna in a Subtropical Wetland
To assess the effects of S. alterniflora establishment on benthic meiofauna, we compared the abundance and community of meiofauna between non-vegetated sandflats, native species (Phragmites australis and Bolboschoenus planiculmis) and S. alterniflora in the Kaomei wetland located on the central western coast of Taiwan in spring and summer. The sediment characteristics differed among vegetation types. The abundance of meiofauna was significantly greater in the dense vegetation of S. alterniflora (2.86 x 106 ind. m-2) than in the adjacent vegetation of B. planiculmis and P. australis (0.36 x 106 ind. m-2 and 0.49 x 106 ind. m-2, respectively) and non-vegetated sandflats (0.0045 x 106 ind. m-2). In both seasons, nematodes were the most dominant group, comprising > 90 % of the total abundance in the meiofaunal community, whereas foraminifera and copepods were the second and third most dominant taxa, respectively. Using rarefaction methods, the highest diversity of meiofaunal taxa occurred in the non-vegetated sandflats, whereas the lowest diversity was found in the dense vegetation of S. alterniflora. Our results suggest that the invasion of S. alterniflora leads to an abrupt increase in the total abundance and a decrease in the diversity of the benthic meiofaunal community in subtropical wetlands.
