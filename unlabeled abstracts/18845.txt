Cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica) Invasion and Eradication: Implications for Soil Nutrient Dynamics in a Longleaf Pine Sandhill Ecosystem
AbstractWe assessed pre- and posteradication nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics in longleaf pine sandhill stands severely affected by cogongrass. Across a 7-yr posteradication (glyphosate + imazapyr) "recovery chronosequence," which included untreated cogongrass, uninvaded reference, and treated plots, we analyzed soils for total N, potentially available P (Mehlich-1 [M1]), pH, and organic matter content. We also used resin bags to assess fluxes of plant available N and P in the soil solution. Additionally, we used litterbags to monitor the decomposition and nutrient mineralization patterns of dead rhizome and foliage tissue. Our results indicate similar total N and M1-P contents in both cogongrass-invaded and uninvaded reference plots, with levels of M1-P being lower than in cogongrass plots for 5 yr after eradication. Soil organic matter did not differ between treatments. Resin bag analyses suggest that cogongrass invasion did not affect soil nitrate availability, although a pulse of NO2+ NO3occurred in the first 3 yr after eradication. No such trends were observed for ammonium. Resin-adsorbed PO4was lowest 3 yr after eradication, and pH was highest 5 yr after eradication. Our litterbag study showed that approximately 55% of foliar biomass and 23% of rhizome tissue biomass remained 18 mo after herbicide treatment. Substantial N immobilization was observed in rhizomes for the first 12 mo, with slow mineralization occurring thereafter. Rapid P mineralization occurred, with 15.4 and 20.5% of initial P remaining after 18 mo in rhizomes and foliage, respectively. Overall, our findings indicate that cogongrass invasion has little to no effect on soil nutrient cycling processes, although some significant--but ephemeral--alterations develop after eradication.
