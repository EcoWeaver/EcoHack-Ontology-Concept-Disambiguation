New records of endoparasitic helminths in alien invasive fishes from the Carpathian region
Six non-native invasive fish species from the Slovak part of the Tisa River basin, namely Carassius gibelio, Pseudorasbora parva, Ameiurus melas, A. nebulosus, Lepomis gibbosus, Perccottus glenii, and three gobiid species from the Danube River, namely Neogobius melanostomus, N. fluviatilis and N. kessleri, were investigated for endohelminth parasites. The expanding Asian cestode Nippotaenia mogurndae (syn. Amurotaenia perccotti) (Nippotaeniidea) has been introduced to Europe with its invasive host P. glenii. Pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus, is a new definitive host of Proteocephalus percae and it is reported as the second intermediate host of the bothriocephalidean cestode Triaenophorus nodulosus in Slovakia.
