Protecting native biodiversity from high-impact invasive species through the protected areas of Parks Canada
Protected Areas (PAs) that maintain their natural ecological integrity are effective land management tools for resource conservation. In Canada, several factors concur to set the pathway for the introduction and establishment of high-impact Invasive Alien Species (IAS) into PAs, threatening regional biodiversity. In response to this threat, Parks Canada and Canadian Parks Council have developed a standard approach for the control of harmful invasive species (alien or native). This integrated ecosystem management standard relies on the Canadian IAS Strategy and recommends that, for PAs, IAS management action should be: i) strategic and operational; ii) efficient; iii) effective; and iv) engaging. In this review paper, we present the aforesaid standard and its use in three selected case studies: i) recovering endangered Garry Oak (Quercus garryana) ecosystems in Gulf Islands National Park Reserve (British Columbia), in Fort Rodd Hill (British Columbia) and in Fisgard Lighthouse (British Columbia) National Historic Sites; ii) preserving Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations at La Mauricie National Park (Quebec); and iii) managing Moose (Alces alces) hyperabundance at Gros Morne National Park (Newfoundland). These three case studies highlight the following: i) the effective management of IAS issues requires cross-jurisdictional, multi-sectorial partnerships and sustained collaboration among stakeholders within the greater ecosystem of each of the PAs; ii) integrated, risk-based (science-based), long-term management of established IAS, in lieu of eradication, is often the most viable option for PAs; iii) ongoing research and monitoring are necessary to validate and/or adapt implemented solutions, and to support public engagement; iv) public education, outreach and interpretation programs provide valuable support for raising awareness of IAS issues and engaging both visitors and the general public. This approach should prove useful where applicable.
