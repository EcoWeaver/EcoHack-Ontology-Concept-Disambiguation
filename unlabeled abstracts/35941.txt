Suitability of ecosystem determination through biology and marketing of exotic fish species, Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1757) from the Ganga River, India
The Oreochromis niloticus (Nile Tilapia) has of great socio-economic importance for the region and keeps active a population of about 700 to 900 fishers at Allahabad. The samples of Oreo-chromis niloticus were collected at random during the months of March 2008 to February 2009 from the middle stretch of the Ganga river at Allahabad, India. Preliminary information was generated on the age, growth, sex ratio and marketing of alien/ exotic fish species, Oreochromis niloticus from the middle stretch of the Ganga river. The samples of O. niloticus were varying from 94 to 415 mm size groups. In case of male, the mean length was recorded 15.99 mm, 22.99 mm, 29.27 mm, 34.92 mm and 40.8 mm in 1+ to 5+ years of the life while in case of female, 15.61 mm, 22.89 mm, 28.52 mm, 34.54 mm and 37.27 mm in 1+ to 5+ years of the life. The 5+ age groups indicated that the Ganga river ecosystem is most suitable and healthy for O. niloticus. Sex ratio of male was higher in 0+ and 1+ age groups and female ratio was higher in 2+, 3+, 4+ and 5+ age groups. In the stock, female sex ratio was higher than male. The economic values were maximum observed for large size fishes. The market values are also varying in respect of religious and non-religious days. It may be concluded that the O. niloticus well stable from the Ganga river at Allahabad, India.
