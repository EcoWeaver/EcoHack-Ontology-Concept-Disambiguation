Invasive mammals in Cuba: an overview
Invasive mammals in Cuba have a negative impact on the conservation of endemic fauna. Rats, mice, mongooses, cats, dogs, among others, pose a threat to the conservation of the Cuban solenodon, the capromyid rodents, and many species of birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates. The current state of introduced and invasive mammal species in Cuba, their impact, available information about their introduction, habits, field observations, distribution, etc., is reviewed. A total of 29 species of invasive mammals in 40 islands of the Cuban Archipelago are reported; the black rat, dog, cat, mouse, mongoose, pig, goat, brown rat, and cattle are the most important. A control policy on invasive species of mammals is urgently needed for the conservation of the fauna of the Cuban Archipelago.
