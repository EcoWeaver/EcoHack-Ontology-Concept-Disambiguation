Development of a mathematical model to evaluate the rate of aggregate risk of invasive alien plant species: Fuzzy risk assessment approach
This study presents a novel approach to evaluate the rate of aggregate risk of Invasive Alien Plant Species. Using risk values and grade of importance of weights of risk factors which may reflect invasiveness of plant species are considered. We use Linguistic Ordered Weighted Averaging operator to evaluate the grade of important of weights. Since the risk values and important weights are identified from two different linguistic term sets, fuzzy set theory techniques were used to combine the two sets. The rates obtained from the model were compared with NRA risk levels and the model was validated with data from known and non-invasive species. The model is improved by weighting the risk values of risk factors. The improved model produced significant results and resulted a better tracking system for identifying potential invaders than the conventional risk assessment.
