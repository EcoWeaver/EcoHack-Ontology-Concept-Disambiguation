Coexistence of the endangered, endemic Chittenango ovate amber snail (Novisuccinea chittenangoensis) and a non-native competitor
Distinguishing between non-native species that coexist with native species and those that threaten their persistence is critical for conservation and management. We investigated this distinction for a non-native terrestrial snail (Succinea sp.) (Sp. B) that occurs with the closely-related Chittenango ovate amber snail (Novisuccinea chittenangoensis) (COAS), an endangered species that is restricted to a single, known site. In 2008 and 2009, we performed ex situ competition experiments to examine the effects of density and body size of Sp. B on growth and mortality of COAS. We also conducted mark-recapture surveys from 2002 to 2009 to document trends of the in situ population of COAS and to identify spatio-temporal factors that may mitigate any competitive interactions between COAS and Sp. B. We observed lower growth rates and higher mortality rates of COAS at higher densities and larger sizes of Sp. B, indicating that the species compete. Nevertheless, population trends indicated that COAS population size was fluctuating but not in decline, and the spatial distribution, phenology, and size structure of each species indicated that there were enough mitigating factors to allow COAS to persist in the presence of Sp. B. Collectively, these results suggest that temporal niche partitioning resulting from a trade-off between growth and longevity of each species may enable their coexistence. Our results also suggest that control of Sp. B is unnecessary and, more generally, underscore the importance of conducting research aimed at understanding the effects of non-native species before instituting long-term, costly, and potentially unnecessary control measures.
