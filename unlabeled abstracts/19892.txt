Invasive Alien Plants of Uttarakhand Himalaya
The present study deals with invasive alien plants of Uttarakhand Himalaya. A total of 163 invasive alien species under 105 genera, belonging to 46 families have been recorded based on field observations, herbarium and literature consultations. Distribution of invasive species based on habitat shows that the maximum number of species are found in wastelands (48 %), followed by cultivated fields (20 %), along road sides (14 %) and forests (8 %). Among these invasive species, 84 species are being used by local inhabitants for medicinal purposes. A better planning is needed for early detection to control and report the infestations of spread of new and naturalized weeds to be monitored.
