Genetics and behavior of a colonizing species: the invasive Argentine ant.
Baker and Stebbins's 1965 book The Genetics of Colonizing Species aimed to draw together scientists from a variety of disciplines to provide a conceptual framework for the study of species introductions. A goal of their volume was to examine how studies on biological invasions could be used to provide insight into basic research questions as well as to develop practical strategies for control. In this article, we attempt to follow the goals of Baker and Stebbins by reviewing work on the genetics and behavior of a widespread colonizing species, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). Specifically, we examine the evolutionary changes that have taken place as a result of this species being introduced into new environments and synthesize recent research on Argentine ants from the perspective of population genetics, recognition systems, and the mechanisms that may underlie their ecological success.
