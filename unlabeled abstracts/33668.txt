A non-invasive method to monitor marine pollution from bacterial DNA present in fish skin mucus
Marine coastal contamination caused by human activity is a major issue worldwide. The implementation of effective pollution monitoring programs, especially in coastal areas, is important and urgent. The use of biological, physiological, or biochemical measurements to monitor the impacts of pollution has garnered increasing interest, particularly for the development of new non-invasive tools to assess water pollution. Fish skin mucus is in direct contact with the marine environment, making it a favourable microenvironment for the formation of biofilm bacterial communities. In this study, we developed a non-invasive technique, sampling fish skin mucus to determine and analyse bacterial community composition using next-generation sequencing. We hypothesised that bacterial communities associated with the skin mucus of a common harbour benthic blennioid triplefin fish, Forsterygion capito, would reflect conditions of different marine environments. We detected clear differences in bacterial community alpha-diversity between contaminated and reference sites. Beta-diversity analysis also revealed differences in the bacterial community structure of the skin mucus of fish inhabiting different geographical areas. The relative abundance of different bacterial orders varied among sites, as determined by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and effect size (LEfSe) analyses. The observed variation in bacterial community compositions correlated more strongly with variation in hydrocarbons than to various metal concentrations. Using advanced DNA sequencing technologies, we have developed a novel non-invasive, low-cost and effective tool to monitor the impacts of pollution through analysis of the bacterial communities associated with fish skin mucus.
