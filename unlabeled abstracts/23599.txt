First data on the freshwater fish fauna of Calabria (southern Italy)
There is scarce information available about the presence and distribution of freshwater fishes in southern Italy, and ichthyological information about Calabrian lotic systems is practically inexistent. This paper reports the current status of the freshwater fish fauna in some of the most important lotic systems of Calabria. Ichthyological samplings were performed at 54 stations along 16 Calabrian rivers. Sixteen fish species belonging to eight families were found, and their presence and distribution is discussed on the basis of biogeographic considerations. The freshwater fish fauna of the area has been dramatically altered by the introduction of allochthonous species, mainly originating from the Po plain catchments. This is a prime example of faunistic transformation of a Mediterranean area.
