Three invasive species occurring in the diets of fishes in a Neotropical floodplain
The composition of the diets of 66 species of fishes was investigated from September 2009 to June 2010 in three subsystems of the Upper Parana River floodplain (Brazil), following invasion by the two mollusk species Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) and Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774), and the macrophyte Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle. Limnoperna fortunei was consumed in all three subsystems and occurred in the diet of 15 fish species, with a high proportion in the diet of Leporinus obtusidens. Corbicula flumineawas present in the diet of Pterodoras granulosus caught in the Parana and Ivinheima subsystems. Hydrilla verticillataoccurred in the diet of Schizodon nasutus caught in the Ivinheima and Parana subsystems. It is not yet possible to evaluate the potential of these species to control invasive mollusks in the study area or the impact of these species on the structure of the food chain. Omnivorous and herbivorous fishes in the study area may have little impact on the population of H. verticillata.
