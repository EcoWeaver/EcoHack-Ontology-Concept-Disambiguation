Interaction between invasive and potentially invasive shrub species does not influence relationships between their ecological success and distance from propagule sources
Although interactions between alien and native plant species are well studied, data on interactions between two co-existing alien species with respect to their invasibility are scarce. The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate three factors shaping abundance of the alien shrub species Cornus alternifolia: abundance of another alien (invasive) shrub species (Prunus serotina), type of tree stand (coniferous vs. broadleaved) and distance to propagule sources and (2) to assess the potential dispersal distance of the species studied. Densities of both species were assessed within 194 experimental plots (located in experimental plantations of trees) in Rogow Arboretum (Central Poland). P. serotina occurred on 79 and C. alternifolia on 33 of the 194 plots. The furthest distance of C. alternifolia from the propagule source was 338 m. C. alternifolia reached higher densities in coniferous than broadleaved tree stands. Density of C. alternifolia depended on tree stand type and distance from the propagule source, but did not depend on density of P. serotina. Density of C. alternifolia decreased with increasing distance from the propagule source; however, this relationship was modified by the type of tree stand: densities were lower in broadleaved than in coniferous stands. The presence of the invasive species seems to neither facilitate nor limit the dispersal distance of C. alternifolia, as these two species differ in shade tolerance. The study also provided the first information about C. alternifolia potential invasiveness, because earlier this species was noticed only as casually escaping from cultivation in Slovakia.
