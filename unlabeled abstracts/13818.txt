Inheritance patterns of photoperiodic diapause induction inLeptinotarsa decemlineata
Photoperiod is a reliable indicator of season and an important cue which many insects use for phenological synchronization. While undergoing range expansion insects can face a change in the local photoperiod to which they need to resynchronize. Rapid range expansion can be associated with rapid photoperiodic adaptation which can be associated with intense selection on strongly heritable polygenic traits. Alternatively it has been proposed that, in insects with a XO sex-determination system, genes with large effect residing on the sex chromosome could be driving photoperiodic adaptation, since the gene or genes are exposed to selection in the sex carrying only a single X-chromosome. The current study seeks to understand which of these alternatives is more likely in explaining rapid photoperiodic adaptation in European Colorado potato beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlineata. Diapause induction is assessed in beetles from a northern and a southern population as well as from reciprocal hybrid crosses between the northern and southern population, when reared at an intermediate length photoperiod. The crosses within population display expected responses, the northern showing high and the southern low diapause propensity. The hybrids show intermediate responses in all studied traits. No clear difference in responses in hybrids depending on latitudinal origin of their father or mother are detected even though partial paternal line dominance is seen in responses of male beetles in one hybrid cross. These results therefore indicate that, in L. decemlineata, photoperiodic diapause induction is strongly heritable, and has an additive polygenic autosomal background.
