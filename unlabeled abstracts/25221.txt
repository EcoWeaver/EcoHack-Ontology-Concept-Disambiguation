Origin of the Helminth Community of an Exotic Invasive Lizard, the Brown Anole, Anolis sagrei (Squamata: Polychrotidae), in Southwestern Taiwan
Composition of the helminth community of the brown anole, Anolis sagrei, an exotic invasive species in Taiwan, was studied to identify the emigration point of this lizard. A total of 5,757 helminths was found, of which 5,734 (99.6%) were the nematode Cyrtosomum penneri. Also found were the digenean Mesocoelium monas (21, 0.4%) and one each of the nematodes Parapharyngodon sp. (female) and Acuariidae gen. sp. (larva). Cyrtosomum penneri has previously been reported in A. sagrei in Florida, supporting the contention that the Taiwan population of A. sagrei originated from Florida. This report provides a basis upon which future A. sagrei parasite studies in Taiwan can be based, and a helminth list for A. sagrei is included for future reference.
