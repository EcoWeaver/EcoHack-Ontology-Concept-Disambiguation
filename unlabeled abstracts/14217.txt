Abiotic controls on population structure of the invasive Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774) in the River Mino estuary
Estuaries act as a vector transferring exotic species between marine and freshwater ecosystems. The morphology and sedimentary characteristics of the River Mino estuary (NW-Spain), defined by tide fluctuations and continental sediment inputs, was dominated by sand. The estuary is a freshwater ecosystem during low tide with limited influence of marine water during high tide. We sampled 47 sampling points confirming that Corbicula fluminea was the dominant species of the estuarine community, reaching a density up to 3150 ind m-2 and a total estuarine biomass of 428 t AFDM. The species presence was limited by salinity values of 15.3 ppm. Density and biomass were positively related with coarse sediments, and sedimentary organic matter that can be taken as a food supplement. The study of size frequency distributions indicated that 20 mm size individuals dominated the estuarine population, with at least two annual cohorts. Smaller individuals preferred coarse sediments and organic matter contents, allowing us to identify in the estuary recruitment areas. The present scientific information aims to be the basis for management plans aiming to control the species in Atlantic estuaries, and help at the same time in the design of experimental essays to validate the observations resulting from this study.
