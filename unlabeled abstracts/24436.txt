Body size and food thresholds for zero growth inDreissena polymorpha: a mechanism underlying intraspecific competition
1. Dreissena polymorpha is an extraordinarily successful invasive species that shows high recruitment of small juvenile mussels on established mussel banks. Such juvenile settlement on, and overgrowth of, large adult mussels; however, leads to competition with adults, and often at high densities and low-food concentrations. 2. The concept of food thresholds for zero growth has been a powerful approach to explaining size-related exploitative competition in different zooplankton species. We applied it to investigate whether food threshold concentrations for zero growth (C0) differ between juvenile and adult zebra mussels. 3. By determining body mass growth at various concentrations of a diet mixture (Nannochloropsis limnetica and Isochrysis aff. galbana) we demonstrate that the threshold food concentration for growth of juvenile mussels (C0 = 0.08 mg C L-1) is substantially lower than that for adults (C0 = 0.36 mg C L-1). 4. This indicates that, at low food availability, juvenile zebra mussels are competitively superior to their larger conspecifics. Within zebra mussel banks plankton food is substantially depleted and so the observed mechanism might ensure juvenile success and therefore the regeneration of mussel banks in nature.
