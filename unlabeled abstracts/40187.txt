Some alien species of aquatic invertebrates in the water bodies of the nature reserve fund of the Kyiv metropolis
The invasion of alien species of freshwater invertebrates and the associated changes in the faunistic composi- tion of local ecosystems are a serious threat to the conservation of biodiversity. In this work, we supplement the existing list of alien species with information about three more species of non-native freshwater invertebrates, which have formed stable populations in water bodies of Ukraine. These are two representatives of flatworms: Girardia tigrina (Girard, 1850) and Stenostomum saliens Kepner & Carter, 1931, as well as a representative of copepods, Eucyclops roseus Ishida, 1997.
