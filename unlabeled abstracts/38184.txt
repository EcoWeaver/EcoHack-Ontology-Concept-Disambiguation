What Can an Invasive Species Tell Us about Evolution? A Study of Dental Variation in Disjunctive Populations of Microtus rossiaemeridionalis (Arvicolinae, Rodentia)
The sibling vole, Microtus rossiaemeridionalis, is a North Eurasian rodent that undergoes range expansion via casual introductions by humans. The documented cases of human-mediated spread of M. rossiaemeridionalis provide an opportunity to explore phenotypic consequences associated with the invasion events. We present an analysis of dental variability in two recently discovered invasive populations of M. rossiaemeridionalis in northern Asia (Surgut and Khabarovsk) and summarize the data on conspecifics within and outside the core range in order to uncover common and specific patterns of dental variation in the disjunctive invasive populations, and to consider the potential evolutionary significance of the phenotypic effects from neontological and paleontological standpoints. The analysis of morphotype dental patterns and inspection for rare traits suggest that the existence of invasive populations under conditions of isolation leads to a release of hidden phenotypic variation, which could be inferred from sharp increases in frequencies of reserve morphotypes and/or rare dental traits, and also from the presence of abnormalities. An atavistic anomaly of the third upper molars revealed in one individual in a fragmented habitat in Surgut recapitulates some features of the prismatic arrangement and occlusal pattern of extinct Mimomys-like arvicolines. All variants of released phenotypic variation in the invasive populations of M. rossiaemeridionalis under conditions of isolation could be interpreted as de-specialization of dentition. Such de-specialization appears to be maladaptive for a herbivore, though it might favor a transition to a more generalized diet and enhance the success during the transport, colonization, and establishment stages of the invasion.
