Mate-location flight of the red-necked longicorn beetle, Aromia bungii (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae): an invasive pest lethal to Rosaceae trees
The red-necked longicorn beetle, Aromia bungii (Faldermann) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), which has recently invaded Japan, is a serious pest species. The larvae kill cherry and orchard Rosaceae trees, such as peach, plum, and apricot. To clarify their features for mate location, male and female flight behaviors were observed in wind tunnels with caged males and females as lures. In a small wind tunnel (50 cm in diameter, 2 m in length), both sexes showed takeoff behavior according to increasing airflow. The rate of female takeoff against the male lure, a live male in a wire-netting cage, tended to be higher than for other combinations. In a large wind tunnel (ca. 1.6 m in diameter, 4 m in length), both sexes ascended and showed momentary hovering and astatic flight. When male lure cages were placed windward in the wind tunnel, females showed "upwind flight," while males did not. It is assumed that females were induced to fly upwind by a factor derived from live males, likely to be an airborne pheromone component.
