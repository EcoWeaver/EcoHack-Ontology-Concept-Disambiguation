Invasive plants in a rapidly changing climate: an Australian perspective
Invasive plants in Australia are currently among the greatest threats to native biological diversity and a significant cost to agriculture. The impact of climate change is projected to be particularly significant for Australia and will add to and change the impact of invasive plants on natural and managed ecosystems. Australia is a large country incorporating a wide variety of climates that often experience significant disturbance events, is likely to undergo significant land-use change with climate change and has a long history of some 26,000 plant species introductions and about 2700 established alien plant species. This combination of features makes it a particularly pertinent place to explore the effect of climate change on invasive plants. Here, the chapter begins by providing background context on plant introductions, climate change and the policy underpinning management relevant for invasive plants in Australia. Then, the existing literature linking climate change and invasive plants is reviewed, focusing on climate change drivers and shifting species distributions, before looking at how the management of invasive plants will be particularly influenced by climate change. The chapter concludes by highlighting five areas where greater research effort is required and where Australian insight is likely to improve best practice management significantly, with global applicability for invasive plants in a changing climate.
