What Is Invasion Biology?
Invasion biology deals with invasive species. If an "invasive" species is defined as a species that spreads to the detriment of economic interests and public health, however, invasion biology could not be easily distinguished from pest management and public health sciences. If an "invasive" species is defined in some other way, for example, because of its ecological rather than economic or health effects, invasion biology might not be distinguished from disciplines which deal with ecological dispersal, colonization, succession, disturbance, etc., and which are already well established in the ecological literature.
