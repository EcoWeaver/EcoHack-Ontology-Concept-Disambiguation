Positive effects of exotic species dampened by neighborhood heterogeneity
It is well known that species interactions between exotic and native species are important for determining the success of biological invasions and how influential exotic species become in invaded communities. The strength and type of interactions between species can substantially vary, however, from negative and detrimental to minimal or even positive. Increasing evidence from the literature shows that exotic species have positive interactions with native species more often than originally thought. Gaps in our theory for how population growth is limited when interactions are positive, however, restrict our understanding of the mechanisms by which exotic 'facilitators' contribute to diversity maintenance in invaded systems. Here, we quantified interactions between seven native and four exotic (established non-native) common annual plant species in the highly diverse, York Gum woodlands of Western Australia. We used a Bayesian demographic modelling approach that allowed for interaction coefficients to be positive or negative, and explored key sources of variation in species responses to native and exotic neighbors at per capita (individual) and neighborhood levels. We observed positive per capita effects from exotic neighbors on exotic focal species as well as on several native focal species. However, all focal species were, on average, inhibited by their interaction neighborhood, when the variance in identity and abundance of observed neighbors was considered. At the neighborhood scale, exotic species were found to suppress all focal species, particularly those with high intrinsic fecundity. Our study demonstrates that within-neighborhood heterogeneity can regulate per capita positive effects of invaders - limiting runaway population growth of both natives and exotic invaders.
