The first data on fungal pathogens (ascomycota, hypocreales) in the invasive populations of four-eyed fir bark beetle Polygraphus proximus Blandf
The population of the invasive pest of Siberian fir--the four-eyed fir bark beetle Polygraphus proximus Blandf. (FFBB) from Western Siberia was examined for the presence of insect pathogenic ascomycetes. Four species of insect pathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana, B. pseudobassiana, Lecanicillium attenuatum, and Isaria farinosa, were detected on the basis of morphological characteristics and/or sequencing data. Bioassays using conidia of fungi B. bassiana and I. farinosa from the ISEA collection were performed against adults of FFBB at different temperatures (5 and 15degC) and 100% RH. The mortality of P. proximus reached 80-100% within 45 days. The fungus B. bassiana was more effective at 15degC as compared to 5degC, whereas I. farinosa was more virulent at 5degC.
