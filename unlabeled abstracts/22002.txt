DNA barcodes reveal deeply neglected diversity and numerous invasions of micromoths in Madagascar
Madagascar is a prime evolutionary hotspot globally, but its unique biodiversity is under threat, essentially from anthropogenic disturbance. There is a race against time to describe and protect the Madagascan endangered biota. Here we present a first molecular characterization of the micromoth fauna of Madagascar. We collected 1572 micromoths mainly using light traps in both natural and anthropogenically disturbed habitats in 24 localities across eastern and northwest Madagascar. We also collected 1384 specimens using a Malaise trap in a primary rain forest at Andasibe. In total, we DNA barcoded 2956 specimens belonging to 1537 BINs, 88.4% of which are new to BOLD. Only 1.7% of new BINs were assigned to species. Of 48 different families found, Dryadaulidae, Bucculatricidae, Bedelliidae, Batrachedridae and Blastobasidae are newly reported for Madagascar. The studied fauna shows highest affinity with the Afrotropics (146 BINs also occur in the African continent). We found 23 recognised pests or invasive species, mostly occurring in disturbed habitats. Malaise trap samples show high temporal turnover and alpha diversity with as many as 507 BINs collected; of these, astonishingly, 499 (98.4%) were novel to BOLD and 292 (57.6%) were singletons. Our results provide a baseline for future surveys across the island.
