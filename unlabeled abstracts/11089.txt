Impact and control of invasive alien species on small islands
Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are confronted with significant problems of biological invasions, arising from conscious or accidental introduction of invasive alien species. Small islands are considered to be fragile and more prone to such invasions than continental areas because of the combined effect of the special characteristics island species have evolved, and the gregariousness of invasive species. Examples from small islands around the world are provided to demonstrate the impacts of invasive alien species on the ecology of small islands, where they have caused large-scale degradation and impoverishment of the indigenous flora and fauna. Many SIDS have embarked on an ambitious control programme of invasive alien species, including exclusion of large introduced animals, and eradication programmes using poisons, manual weeding and /or herbicides. It is considered important that research on biological invasions continues to enhance the understanding of the behaviour of invasive alien species and their impacts on islands.
