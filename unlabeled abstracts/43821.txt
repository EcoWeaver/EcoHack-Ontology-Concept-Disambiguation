Field Observations of Invasive Species Aedes japonicus and Larval Contemporaries in Escambia County, Florida
ABSTRACT The Asian bush mosquito, Aedes japonicus, is an invasive species that is well established in North America and Europe. Though it is considered a temperate species, we have observed an established population of Ae. japonicus in the subtropical climate of northwestern Florida. To evaluate the temporal patterns of Ae. japonicus abundance, mosquito larvae were collected from 15 artificial containers in Escambia County, FL, from August 2019 to July 2020, with the prediction that Ae. japonicus abundance would peak in the winter months and decline with increasing ambient temperatures. Aedes japonicus larvae were collected in low abundances during each month except for February (n = 51), with no clear temporal patterns of abundance. Larval contemporaries belonging to other species were considered in sampling of containers and were also cataloged. We demonstrate monthly observance of this temperate species at a single site in the Florida panhandle, exemplifying the persistence of Ae. japonicus through all seasons in a subtropical climate.
