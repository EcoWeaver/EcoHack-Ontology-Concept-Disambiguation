Dalmatian Toadflax (Linaria dalmatica): New Host for Cucumber Mosaic Virus
To date, there have been no reports of Dalmatian toadflax serving as a host for cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Infestations of Dalmatian toadflax may serve as a reservoir of CMV, thereby facilitating aphid transmission of CMV to both agricultural crops and native plants. The goal of this study was to determine whether Dalmatian toadflax is a host for CMV. Dalmatian toadflax seedlings were randomly assigned to two treatments (18 replicates/treatment): no inoculation (control) and inoculation with CMV (Fast New York strain). The Dalmatian toadflax seedlings were inoculated by standard mechanical methods and tested for the presence of CMV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Ten of the 18 CMV-inoculated toadflax plants tested positive for the virus; 6 of the 18 displayed systemic mosaic chlorosis and leaf curling. All control plants tested negative. Transmission electron microscopy obtained from CMV-positive plants confirmed the presence of CMV based on physical properties. To verify CMV infestation, tobacco plants were assigned to the following treatments (six replicates/treatment): no inoculation (control), CMV-negative (control) inoculation, and a CMV-positive inoculation. Plants were inoculated by standard methods. Five of the 6 tobacco plants treated with the CMV-positive inoculum tested positive for CMV using ELISA. All control plants tested negative for the virus.
