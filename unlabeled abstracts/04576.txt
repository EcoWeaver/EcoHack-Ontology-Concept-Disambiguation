Anthropogenic areas as incidental substitutes for original habitat
In conservation ecology one speaks of ecological substitutes of species when the main ecosystem function played by one locally extinct native species is substituted, to some extent, by an introduced species. We suggest here that a parallel can be traced at the scale of habitats. Species evolve within ecosystems, but habitats can either vanish or be modified, both by natural and human-made causes. Sometimes habitat alteration forces animals to move to (or to remain only in) a suboptimal habitat type. In that case the habitat is considered to be a refuge, and the species is called a refugee. Typically refugee species have lower population growth rates than in their original habitats. However, human action may lead to the unintended generation of artificial or semi-artificial habitat types, which functionally resemble the essential features of the original habitat, allowing a population growth of the same magnitude or higher than in their original habitats. In this case we could talk of "substitution habitats". We define substitution habitats as those human-made habitats, located within the focal species range, that, just by chance, happen to be partial substitutes of the original species' habitat type. The label we propose for a species when occupying a substitution habitat is "adopted species". These are two new terms for conservation biology. We present and discuss four examples of substitution habitats and adopted species. Although substitution habitats can bring about increased resilience against the agents of global change, the conservation of original habitat types remains a conservation priority.
