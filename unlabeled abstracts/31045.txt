The invasion of an Atlantic Ocean river basin in Patagonia by Chinook salmon: new insights from SNPs
Chinook salmon spawning was first reported in the 1980s in the Caterina River tributary of the Santa Cruz River basin of Patagonia, which drains into the Atlantic Ocean. A naturalized population now persists and its source has been debated. Chinook salmon from California populations was directly released into the Santa Cruz River in the early twentieth century, but ocean ranching experiments on the Pacific coast of Patagonia (Chile) also released Chinook salmon of lower Columbia River origin (University of Washington hatchery stock) in the late twentieth century. We used genetic stock identification with single nucleotide polymorphisms to explore the origin of this Chinook salmon population. The genotypes of salmon that invaded the Santa Cruz River were compared with those derived from 69 known populations from the Northern Hemisphere. Chinook Salmon of the Santa Cruz River were found to be most similar to those from the lower Columbia River. This supports the hypothesis that the Santa Cruz River population was founded from the ocean ranching in southern Chile and the river was invaded by fish straying from Pacific coast basins. Moreover, we find that the life history of these naturalized fish, as inferred from scale analysis, was similar to that of the progenitor stock. We suggest that the successful invasion of the Caterina River in Patagonia by Chinook salmon was aided by pre-adaptations of some of the stocks used in the ocean ranching experiments to conditions in the new environment, rather than a post-colonization adaptation.
