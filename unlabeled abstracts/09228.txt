From introduced species to invader: what determines variation in the success ofCodium fragile ssp.tomentosoides (Chlorophyta) in the North Atlantic Ocean?
The green alga Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides (Chlorophyta) has been introduced accidentally and successfully from Japan to many shores of the northern and southern hemispheres, including those of the Northeast and Northwest Atlantic Ocean. On most European coasts, Codium occurs regularly but at low abundances in the intertidal zone and is absent from subtidal habitats. In contrast, Codium is extremely abundant in subtidal kelp beds in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean where it often reaches nuisance proportions. This differential success cannot be accounted for by either the properties of the invader or by physico-chemical differences between invaded coasts. A theoretical comparison between two regions on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, i.e. Eastern Nova Scotia, Canada, and south central Britain, illustrates how the resident benthic community may determine the difference in relative abundance of Codium in subtidal habitats between northeast America and Europe. In this review, low floral species diversity, biological disturbance and facilitation by a previous species invasion are suggested as potential factors for the establishment, success and abundance of Codium in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, but these require testing in field experiments.
