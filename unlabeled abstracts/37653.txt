Occurrence of the Invasive Lady Beetle Harmonia Axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in Iran
The Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is one of the most invasive insects worldwide. It has been introduced into several continents for classical biological control and by accident. The current study is the first report of this species from Iran (new country record). All developmental stages and adults of two morphs, succinea and spectabilis, were collected from fruit trees and ornamental gardens in the city of Rasht in the northern Iranian province Guilan in 2016. We collected 249 adults of the color morph succinea and 31 individuals (11%) of the melanic color morph spectabilis. Only 36% of individuals were males. Larvae and pupae were found from April to September, adults from April to October.
