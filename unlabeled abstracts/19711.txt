Seedlings of a native shrub can establish under forests dominated by an alien tree, Casuarina equisetifolia, on subtropical oceanic islands
We investigated the effects of litter accumulation by an alien tree, Casuarina equisetifolia, on the germination and seedling establishment of Rhaphiolepis wrightiana, a shrub native to the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, in a field experiment. We compared the emergence of seedlings in forests dominated by C. equisetifolia with that in native forests, with and without litter removal. More than 75% of seedlings emerged during a year except at the C. equisetifolia sites with litter removal (approximately 45%). Thus, seeds of R. wrightiana can germinate under C. equisetifolia if they are dispersed on the ground.
