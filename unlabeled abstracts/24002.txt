The Herpetofauna of the Camp Shelby Joint Forces Training Center in the Gulf Coastal Plain of Mississippi
The Camp Shelby Joint Forces Training Center (CSJFTC) is a 54,315-ha National Guard training installation located in the Piney Woods subprovince of the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic region of south-central Mississippi. A list of 108 native amphibian and reptile species possibly occurring on the CSJFTC was generated using known geographic distribution ranges and museum records. General herpetofaunal field-collecting techniques were used to survey the CSJFTC's aquatic and terrestrial habitats from April 2004-April 2007. Eighty-three native and one introduced species were identified, comprising 59% of the state's known (excluding marine species) and 77% of the CSJFTC's suspected herpetofauna. Ten species listed as needing special protection by state or federal agencies occur at the site, including Crotalus adamanteus, Gopherus polyphemus, Lampropeltis calligaster, Masticophis flagellum, Micrurus fulvius, Ophisaurus attenuatus, Pituophis melanoleucus, Pseudacris ornata, Pseudotriton ruber, and Regina rigida. This information will be useful in directing future monitoring efforts and when developing management plans on the CSJFTC.
