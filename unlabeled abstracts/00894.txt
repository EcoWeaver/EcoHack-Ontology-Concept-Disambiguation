Antibodies targeting the PfRH1 binding domain inhibit invasion of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites
Author Summary Plasmodium falciparum causes the most virulent form of human malaria. The pathology of the disease is associated with the invasion, replication and subsequent destruction of the erythrocyte by the parasite. Invasion of the host erythrocyte by the invasive form of the parasite, the merozoite, is a key step involving the interaction of several parasite ligands with receptors on the host cell surface. A better understanding of the molecular basis for these interactions is crucial for developing effective strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality due to malaria. Members of the RBLs and EBLs are found in all Plasmodium spp. so far analyzed and play an important role in parasite virulence, host cell selection and possibly immune evasion. How binding of EBLs or RBLs to specific erythrocyte receptors ultimately leads to merozoite invasion is an important question that requires the parasite ligand to be dissected into functional domains. Here, we show that a relatively small region of the PfRH1 molecule is involved in receptor recognition. Only parasites that utilize a sialic acid-dependent invasion pathway are inhibited by antiserum raised against the minimal binding region. In addition, switching of the invasion pathway from a sialic acid-dependent to a sialic acid-independent pathway renders the inhibitory antibodies ineffective with a concomitant reduction in the amount of PfRH1 expressed. This demonstrates that invasion pathway switching in P. falciparum can also serve as a mechanism of immune evasion.
