Ontogenetic changes in pharyngeal morphology correlate with a diet shift from arthropods to dreissenid mussels in round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus)
The potential of predators to regulate populations of dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) has been addressed since early in the dreissenid invasion of North America. Round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) larger than approximately 60mm have been shown to prey extensively on dreissenids, whereas smaller round gobies feed mainly on aquatic insects and crustaceans. We propose that ontogenetic changes in pharyngeal morphology may contribute to this diet shift in round gobies. Pharyngeals of 69 round gobies ranging from 31 to 164mm total length were investigated using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Areas of lower pharyngeals and pharyngobranchial 2 increased allometrically with fish length. Pharyngeals of round gobies smaller than 50mm contained narrow (
