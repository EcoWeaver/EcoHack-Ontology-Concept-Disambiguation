Population genetics and symbiont assemblages support opposing invasion scenarios for the red turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus valens)
Exotic forest insects and their symbionts pose an increasing threat to forest health. This is apparently true for the red turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus valens), which was unintentionally introduced to China, where the beetle has killed millions of healthy native pine trees. Previous population genetics studies that used cytochrome oxidase I as a marker concluded that the source of D. valens in China was western North America. In contrast, surveys of fungi associated with D. valens demonstrated that more fungal species are shared between China and eastern North America than between China and western North America, suggesting that the source population of D. valens could be eastern North America. In this study, we used microsatellite markers to determine population structure of D. valens in North America as well as the source population of the beetle in China. The analyses revealed that four genetically distinct populations (herein named the West, Central, Northeast and Mexico) represent the native range of D. valens. Clustering analyses and a simulation-based approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach supported the hypothesis that western North America is the source of the invasive D. valens population. This study provides a demonstration of non-congruence between patterns inferred by studies on population genetics and symbiont assemblages in an invasive bark beetle.
