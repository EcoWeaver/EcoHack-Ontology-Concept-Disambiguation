Can People Value Protection against Invasive Marine Species? Evidence from a Joint TC-CV Survey in the Netherlands
Harmful algal-bloom species (HABs) are invasiveexotic species that are primarily introduced inNorth European waters through ballast water ofships. Some produce important damages to themarine ecosystem such as the red tides thatcause a massive destruction of marine livingresources, including fish and bottom-livinganimals. Others are responsible for theproduction of thick foams with repellent odorsand the coloration of the beach water, causingimportant damages on beach recreation. Thisarticle reports a monetary valuation study of amarine protection program. This program focuseson the prevention of HABS along the coastlineof the Netherlands. It entails the constructionof a ballast water disposal treatment in theRotterdam harbor and the implementationof a monitoring program of the water quality inthe open sea along the North-Holland beaches.The valuation study is based on a questionnaireundertaken at Zandvoort, a famous Dutchbeach resort. The economic value of the marineprotection program includes non-market benefitsassociated with beach recreation, human healthand marine ecosystem impacts. Both contingent-valuation and travel-cost methods are used.These valuation techniques have not yet beenapplied to value HABs damages. The valuationresults indicate that the protection programmakes sense from an economic perspective aslong as its cost is, in any case, less than 225 millioneuro, and possibly less than 326 million euro, depending on how survey refusals are dealt with.
