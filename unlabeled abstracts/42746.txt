Allelopathic effects of Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. in the invasive process
Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed), an annual native to North America, is now present in many European countries where it causes summer hay fever and interferes with several important crops. We investigated if common ragweed invasiveness could be explained by its leaf tissue and root exudate allelopathic potential on indicator crops (alfalfa, barley, maize, lettuce, tomato, and wheat), weeds (Echinochloa crus-galli, Solanum nigrum, Portulaca oleracea, and Digitaria sanguinalis), and common ragweed itself in laboratory and greenhouse conditions. Different residue substrates were prepared for soil incorporation and trials were conducted under both laboratory (1, 2, and 3 g residues/Parker dish) and greenhouse conditions (1.28 g residues/pot). The effect of the preparations on the germination and growth of the indicator crops and weeds were evaluated relative to soil previously used to grow A. artemisiifolia. Results showed tomato was the most sensitive indicator crop species as growth was reduced by more than 50% in both laboratory and greenhouse experiments. Lettuce root and shoot growth were also inhibited, but only when common ragweed residues, and not root exudates, were added to the substrate. Among the weeds, E. crus-galli was not affected by common ragweed while D. sanguinalis suffered a large germination reduction (90%) after incorporation of 3 g of residues. If common ragweed occurred as weed in a field, the cultivation of a less sensitive crop such as winter wheat should be considered before the cultivation of a more susceptible crop.
