Asian Fish Tapeworm: The Most Successful Invasive Parasite in Freshwaters.
The Asian fish tapeworm (AFT), Schyzocotyle acheilognathi, is a notorious and highly successful invasive parasite reported in a wide spectrum of freshwater fishes, and new reports of its spread continue to emerge. To date, no thorough review of its worldwide distribution and host associations is available. In the present work, we collected information from 651 articles up until 2017, from which we updated the number of the hosts to 312 fish species and 11 non-fish species, which is quite unusual among helminths. The AFT has spread to all but one continent (Antarctica). The highest number of records are from North America, followed by Asia and Europe. A key feature of its invasive success is its broad environmental tolerance.
