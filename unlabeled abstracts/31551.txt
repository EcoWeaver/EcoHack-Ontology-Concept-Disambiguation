Genetic structure and diversity of introduced eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) in south-eastern Australia
The closely related eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) and western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) have been introduced into many countries and collectively represent the most widely distributed freshwater fish in the world. We investigated genetic patterns associated with the spread of G. holbrooki in its introduced range in south-eastern Australia, by sampling 60 G. holbrooki populations (n = 1771) from major regions where G. holbrooki was initially introduced into Australia, and characterising the genetic diversity and population structure of G. holbrooki, using five polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci and sequences from two mitochondrial genetic markers. Results were compared with published data on American and European Gambusia samples and historical records. Low microsatellite diversity and strong population genetic structuring were found within G. holbrooki in south-eastern Australia. Observed heterozygosity and allelic richness declined regionally in the order Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne and Adelaide. Microsatellite variation in Australia was reduced compared with native populations. Two mitochondrial DNA haplotypes of G. holbrooki were found; one was common, whereas the other was detected in one Sydney population and one Melbourne population. Cytochrome b sequence diversity was reduced compared with native and European ranges, and sequences were identical to two haplotypes previously identified. Microsatellite diversity of G. holbrooki in south-eastern Australia validates historical records of its spread, beginning north and moving south. Mitochondrial sequencing confirms that G. holbrooki is present in Australia, but the origins of Australian G. holbrooki populations remain unclear.
