Stochastic expression of invasion genes in Plasmodium falciparum schizonts
Genetically identical cells are known to exhibit differential phenotypes in the same environmental conditions. These phenotypic variants are linked to transcriptional stochasticity and have been shown to contribute towards adaptive flexibility of a wide range of unicellular organisms. Here, we investigate transcriptional heterogeneity and stochastic gene expression in Plasmodium falciparum by performing the quasilinear multiple annealing and looping based amplification cycles (MALBAC) based amplification and single cell RNA sequencing of blood stage schizonts. Our data reveals significant transcriptional variations in the schizont stage with a distinct group of highly variable invasion gene transcripts being identified. Moreover, the data reflects several diversification processes including putative developmental "checkpoint"; transcriptomically distinct parasite sub-populations and transcriptional switches in variable gene families (var, rifin, phist). Most of these features of transcriptional variability are preserved in isogenic parasite cell populations (albeit with a lesser amplitude) suggesting a role of epigenetic factors in cell-to-cell transcriptional variations in human malaria parasites. Lastly, we apply quantitative RT-PCR and RNA-FISH approach and confirm stochastic expression of key invasion genes, such as, msp1, msp3, msp7, eba181 and ama1 which represent prime candidates for invasion-blocking vaccines. Genetically identical cells can be phenotypically diverse to allow adaptive flexibility in a given environment. This phenotypic diversity is driven by epigenetic and transcriptional variability. Here, Tripathi et al. perform scRNA-seq of isogenic and non-isogenic Plasmodium falciparum schizont populations to explore transcriptional heterogeneity and stochastic gene expression during the course of development.
