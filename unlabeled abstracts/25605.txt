Herbaceous Plant Succession at Sand Prairie-scrub Oak Nature Preserve, Mason County, Illinois
The herbaceous vegetation was studied at one-, three-, and twelve-year intervals following clearing of a pine plantation at the Sand Prairie-Scrub Oak Nature Preserve, Mason County, Illinois. The annual species Setaria faberi (giant foxtail), Bidens bipinnata (Spanish needles), and Digitaria sanguinalis (crabgrass) dominated the first year. The native perennial grass Dichanthelium villosissimum (hairy panic grass) along with the exotic species Mollugo verticillata (carpetweed) were prominent the third year while Diodia teres (buttonweed) and Eragrostis trichodes (sand love grass) dominated the 12th year. Many native species commonly associated with dry sand prairies were present by the 12th year, but some exotic and native weedy species were still present.
