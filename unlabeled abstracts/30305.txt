Temporal analysis of Mauremys leprosa (Testudines, Geoemydidae) distribution in northeastern Iberia: unusual increase in the distribution of a native species
Populations of most species of freshwater turtles in Europe show negative trends due to a number of factors. The European distribution of the Mediter-ranean stripe-necked terrapin (Mauremys leprosa) is restricted to the Iberian Peninsula and a small area in southern France. The species is considered common in Spain and Portugal but has shown a decrease in its distribution and population density though most of the Iberian Peninsula, other than the Catalonia region in the northeast. The main objective of this work was to use ecological niche modelling to evaluate trends in the status of M. leprosa in the Catalonia region. Species distribution has increased over time from coastal to inland areas. The maximum altitude of the species in the study area increased throughout the three time periods studied. M. leprosa is becoming more common with less isolated populations. Realised niche models indicated that M. leprosa preferred wetlands and water bodies, artificial surfaces and agricultural areas up to 900 m with sunny orientations. In regards to climatic preferences, M. leprosa is a thermophilous species that, unlike other native freshwater European turtles, shows some tolerance for habitat disturbance.
