A practical approach to assess the native status of a rare plant species: the controverse of Buxus sempervirens L. in northern France revisited
Whether a species is native or introduced in a given geographic area is of major interest within the framewok of biological conservation. A practical approach combining phytosociological, ecological, phytogeographical and historical data is proposed to explore this status for rare plant species, and applied to Boxtree in northern France. Buxus sempervirens L. is an evergreen sub-mediterranean species whose wild populations in northern France are very rare and threatened. Its status - native or introduced - has long been be controversial. Three types of Box-woodland were found in the study area: 1) a Taxus baccata - Buxus sempervirens community which is strongly linked to post-Renaissance castles, 2) a Fraxinus excelsior-Mercurialis perennis community which may be related both to steep chalk slopes where Box was expected to be native and to Medieval castles, 3) a Quercus pubescens-Buxus sempervirens community which may be considered as an immature anthropogenic woodland. In all cases Buxus sempervirens was observed close to archaeological sites and together with exotic and/or nitrophilous plant species. Consequently Box is probably originally an introduced species in northern France and should be considered as both an archaeophyte and a feudal plant. This method offers an interesting alternative to determine the indigenity status of a rare plant species in its localities that would provide sufficiently accurate criteria in most of the cases.
