Consumption of introduced oak litter by native decomposers (Glomeridae, Diplopoda)
In view of the predicted climate change in Central Europe, preventive forestry adaptation strategies are currently being developed in Germany to maintain stable forest ecosystems with high biodiversity. Mediterranean, drought-tolerant oak species such as Quercus pubescens, Quercus frainetto and Quercus ilex are being evaluated as future forest trees for German forest sites which are becoming increasingly dry. The present study represents first investigations concerning the influence of these introduced species on local soil-biological processes, especially primary leaf litter decomposition. The feeding activity of native Glomeris marginata was observed with the Mediterranean leaf litter in comparison to litter of local Quercus robur and Fagus sylvatica under laboratory conditions. In the experiments the introduced litter was readily fed upon by local millipede populations. The results furthermore show that the introduced litter is consumed at equal or even higher rates than the litter of native tree species. Leaf litter of the introduced tree species seems to have no or possibly even a positive influence on the feeding activity of G. marginata.
