Further steps of Cryptorchestia garbinii invasion in Polish inland waters with insights into its molecular diversity in Central and Western Europe
Cryptorchestia garbinii Ruffo, Tarocco and Latella, 2014 (Amphipoda: Talitridae), a semiterrestrial amphipod, reported (as Orchestia cavimana Heller, 1865) from the Polish inland waters, e.g., the lowermost Vistula River, for the first time in 2009. Now, we have reported this species from the upper Oder River, which is c.a. 350 km SE from the closest known localities near Berlin, Germany. We confirmed its identity by the DNA barcodes and showed that all individuals found so far in other countries in Central and Western Europe represent the same haplotype, excluding a singleton from the locus typicus of this species in Lake Garda, Italy.
