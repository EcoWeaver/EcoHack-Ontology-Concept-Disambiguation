Biology of Platycephala planifrons (Diptera: Chloropidae) and its potential effectiveness as biological control agent for invasive Phragmites australis in North America
Phragmites australis is a cosmopolitan clonal grass valued for its support of diversity-rich communities in its native range and feared for its devastating effects on native diversity where the species is introduced. Lack of successful control in North America resulted in the initiation of a biological control program. We used a combination of field surveys and common garden experiments in Europe to study life history and ecology of a chloropid fly, Platycephala planifrons, to assess its potential as a biological control agent. The fly is widely distributed (in non-flooded sites) throughout Eurasia but attack rates are generally low (mean 5-10%; max. 29%). Adults emerge in late June and may live for several months. Females lay eggs at the base of Ph. australis shoots. First instar larvae of this stem-feeding fly overwinter in dormant below-ground shoots of Ph. australis and rapidly complete development in early spring. Larval feeding destroys the growing meristem of the shoot causing premature wilting and 60-70% reductions in shoot biomass production. Early season attack and considerable impact suggest that Pl. planifrons could be a potent biocontrol agent, if it can escape suppression by natural enemies in the introduced range. However, the generally low attack rates in its native range and its dependence on dry sites appear to make the species a "second-choice" candidate for potential release in North America.
