Daphnia invasion: population dynamics of Daphnia assemblages in two eutrophic lakes with particular reference to the introduced alien Daphnia ambigua
The population dynamics of Daphnia species (D.cucullata, D.ambigua, D.galeata) in two small, productive lakes were studied and experiments with field enclosures were carried out to elucidate the ecological niches of the introduced, alien species D.ambigua. Daphnia ambiguo coexisted temporally with the similarly sized D.cucullata, but lived in deeper water. Although both species had the same clutch sizes, similar proportions of ovigerous females, and death rates. D.cucullata was nurnerically dominant over D.ambigua. This suggests that the observed difference in abundance is simply a result of the slower population growth rates of D.ambigua at lower temperatures in greater depths. The experiments with field enclosures showed that when D.culcullata and D.ambigua were forced to live in the same layer of water, D.ambigua was numerically dominant over D.culullata both in the enclosures with and without fish. As the difference between the abundances of the two species decreased in the enclosure with fish, D.cucullata seems to be better protected against fish predation than D.ambigua. In the enclosures without fish, D.ambigua and D.cucullata were numerically surpassed by the larger species D.galeara. The present results imply that in some productive lakes with a high fish stock, D.mbigua invaded the niche of D.galeara and that the species can become an important component of the native zooplankton. The results also support the opinion that co-existing Daphnia can have very similar dynamics and niches.
