The role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in non-native plant invasion along mountain roads
Plant associated mutualists can mediate invasion success by affecting the ecological niche of non-native plant species. Anthropogenic disturbance is also key in facilitating invasion success through changes in biotic and abiotic conditions, but the combined effect of these two factors in natural environments is understudied. To better understand this interaction, we investigated how disturbance and its interaction with mycorrhizas could impact range dynamics of non-native plant species in the mountains of Norway. Therefore, we studied the root colonisation and community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in disturbed vs. undisturbed plots along mountain roads. We found that roadside disturbance strongly increases fungal diversity and richness while also promoting arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal root colonisation in an otherwise ecto- and ericoid-mycorrhiza dominated environment. Surprisingly, AM fungi associating with non-native plant species were present across the whole elevation gradient, even above the highest elevational limit of non-native plants, indicating that mycorrhizal fungi are not currently limiting the upward movement of non-native plants. We conclude that roadside disturbance has a positive effect on AM fungal colonization and richness, possibly supporting spread of non-native plants, but that there is no absolute limitation of belowground mutualists, even at high elevation.
