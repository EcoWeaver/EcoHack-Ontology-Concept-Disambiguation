Predation of invasive crayfish on aquatic vertebrates: the effect of Procambarus clarkii on fish assemblages in Mediterranean temporary streams
Non-indigenous species (NIS) have various effects on indigenous communities. In some cases, species invasion can result in substantial loss of biodiversity through competitive interactions and predation In fresh water, in particular, the extinction of indigenous species is becoming common as aggressive species invade degraded ecosystems. The loss of biodiversity has often been caused by the spread of species assisted by man. Endemic fish and amphibians are among the taxa most vulnerable to intentional introductions throughout the world. As a result of introductions of NIS, several species have disappeared or have been subject to major reductions in their numbers to the extent that they are now threatened with extinction
