Aspects of the Ecology of the Hitch, Lavinia exilicauda (Cyprinidae), a Persistent Native Cyprinid in Clear Lake, California
Growth, diet, and fecundity of Clear Lake hitch (Lavinia exilicauda chi) were investigated to see if any changes had taken place following the establishment of a large population of Mississippi silversides (Menidia audens) in the lake. No changes were found. Hitch seem to avoid competing with silversides for zooplankton by being limnetic in all except the early life history stages. Fecundity was found to be higher than that of Beardsley Reservoir hitch, but considerably lower than a previous estimate had indicated.
