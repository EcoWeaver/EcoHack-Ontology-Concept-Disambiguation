Invasion of the African sharp-tooth catfish Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822) in South China
We record here the invasion of the African sharp-tooth catfish Clarias gariepinus in the South China biodiversity hotspot, an area rich in endemic and endangered fish fauna. C. gariepinus was introduced into the natural systems as escapees from aquaculture ponds. These catfishes are very large, top predators, and thus have the potential to cause serious threats to the native fish fauna. The impact of C. gariepinus needs more investigation with emphasis on developing techniques for controlling its dispersal. KeywordsAlien species-African catfish-Invasion-Control measures-South China
