O caramujo exotico invasor Achatina fulica (Stylommatophora, Mollusca) no Estado do Rio de Janeiro (Brasil): situacao atual
The invasive African snail Achatina fulica was introduced in Brazil through South and Southeast States in at least three separate occasions. A. fulica is currently present in 24 out of 26 Brazilian States and in the Federal District. Dense populations of A. fulica are nuisance to human populations and pest to gardens and small crops. Such populations also act in the transmission of two zoonosis (abdominal angiostrongyliasis and eosinophilic meningitis) as well as other parasitosis of veterinary importance. Here, we report new records of A. fulica and of nematode larvae of medical and veterinary importance found in this snail in the state of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). A. fulica is present in 26 additional municipalities of the state when compared to the information obtained in 2006, year of the last census. This result represents an increase of 50% in the number of municipalities infested. Only nine out of the 92 municipalities of the state have not yet registered the presence of this invasive species. Nematode larvae of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus, Rhabditis sp. e Strongyluris-like, all of veterinary importance, have been registered in A. fulica individuals from eleven municipalities of the state. The rapid range expansion of A. fulica calls attention for the need of a general and continuous management plan throughout the country in order to effectively control the invasion. The current level of infestation makes a full eradication unlikely.
