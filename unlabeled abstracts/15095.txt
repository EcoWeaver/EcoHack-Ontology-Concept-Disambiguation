First record of the invasive vinegar fly Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura)(Diptera: Drosophilidae) from eastern Turkey
Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura, 1931) (Diptera: Drosophilidae) is native to East Asia and invasive on the European and American continents. The first records in both Europe and the United States were in 2008. Since that year, it has widely moved across these continents. As D. Suzukii females lay eggs in healthy ripening fruits of several species, particularly in small soft fruits and berries, the species causes agricultural damage. The soft thin-skinned fruit pest, identified as D. Suzukii, has been found in Erzurum, Turkey, where damaged strawberry crops were observed and cultured in the middle of August and September 2014. Initially, 2 adults, 3 pupae, and several larvae were observed. Emergence of male and female adults continued for 10 more days. Here we report the first finding of D. Suzukii in Turkey.
