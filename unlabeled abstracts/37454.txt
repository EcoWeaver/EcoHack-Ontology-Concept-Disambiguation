Trophic mercury biomagnification patterns in two European rivers following introduction of invasive round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus)
In this study, we examine multiple trophic levels in two Central European rivers (the Dyje and Elbe) to assess whether round goby invasion has changed the pattern of total mercury (Hg) transfer through trophic levels. In the absence of comparable historical data, we also examined levels for European gudgeon, a native benthic species occupying a similar trophic niche to round goby. Our data clearly indicated bioaccumulation of total Hg with increasing trophic position in both rivers. Patterns were very similar in both rivers, with no significant difference in total Hg accumulation between round goby and gudgeon. Biomagnification factors (BMFs) were high for gobies (higher in the Elbe) and relatively low for perch (higher in the Dyje), with levels for burbot (Dyje) similar to those for gobies. Goby dietary analysis revealed a clear preference for benthic macroinvertebrates on both rivers, with zebra mussels taken only occasionally. Likewise, both perch and burbot have an omnivorous diet, effectively "diluting" total Hg accumulation from benthivorous fish. Our results indicate that goby invasion has not altered the pattern of trophic contaminant transfer and, consequently, has not increased threat levels to top predators and humans. Our results corroborate findings from around Europe suggesting a preference for macroinvertebrates over zebra mussels and provide further evidence for case-specificity regarding potential round goby impacts on recipient systems.
