Detection and monitoring of pink bollworm moths and invasive insects using pheromone traps and encounter rate models
The pink bollworm moth Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is one of the most destructive pests in agriculture. An ongoing eradication program using a combination of sex pheromone monitoring and mating disruption, irradiated sterile moth releases, genetically modified Bt cotton and local insecticide applications have all but exterminated the pink bollworm from the south-western USA and portions of northern Mexico. However, the continued threat of reinvasion from Mexico reinforces the need to improve pheromone-based monitoring. Invasions from other parts of the world such as India, where resistance to single-gene transgenic Bt cotton has evolved, further heightens the need for better monitoring strategies.
