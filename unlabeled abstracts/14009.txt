Response of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages to round (Neogobius melanostomus, Pallas 1814) and tubenose (Proterorhinus semilunaris, Heckel 1837) goby predation pressure
One of the main assumed impacts of invasive gobies is predation on benthic macroinvertebrates. Despite numerous dietary studies, however, quantitative evaluations of impact in European river systems are scarce. Here, we investigate the impact of tubenose (Proterorhinus semilunaris, Heckel 1837) and round (Neogobius melanostomus, Pallas 1814) gobies on macroinvertebrates in a lowland river (River Dyje, Czech Republic) by allowing and preventing gobiid access to rip-rap substrate naturally colonised by invertebrates at two sites (Site 1--tubenose goby only, Site 2--tubenose and round gobies). Gobies had a negative impact on invertebrates at both sites, with overall invertebrate density reduced by 15% (ca. 17.9 g m-2 per year) at Site 1 and 36% (ca. 23.6 g m-2 per year) at Site 2. Both species showed increased impact in summer and ingested larger invertebrates preferentially, resulting in an overall reduction in invertebrate body size. Tubenose gobies had a significant impact on Annelida, Gastropoda, Crustacea and Ephemeroptera nymphs, while tubenose and round goby together impacted Annelida, Bivalvia (Dreissena), Gastropoda, Crustacea, Ephemeroptera nymphs, Odonata nymphs and Chironomidae larvae. Our results confirm that round and tubenose gobies can have a significant negative impact on aquatic invertebrate density and community composition.
