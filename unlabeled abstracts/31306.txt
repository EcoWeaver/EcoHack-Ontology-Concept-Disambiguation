Effects of temperature and nitrogen availability on the growth of invasive and native cyanobacteria
Rising temperatures are expected to favour the growth of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in temperate lakes, but may also change the composition of cyanobacterial communities. To predict future community and bloom dynamics, it is therefore important to understand how bloom-forming species respond to temperature. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Seenayya & Subba Raju is an invasive, toxin-producing, nitrogen-fixer that may benefit from warming. To understand how changing temperatures will influence its ability to compete against native North American bloom-formers, we characterized the thermal reaction norms and temperature traits of three C. raciborskii strains, four strains of Microcystis aeruginosa (Kutzing) Kutzing and one strain of Anabaena flos-aquae (Lyng.) Breb. C. raciborskii strains had higher optimum temperatures and survived higher temperatures than toxic M. aeruginosa strains, but had no apparent advantage over the non-toxic M. aeruginosa strain or A. flos-aquae. M. aeruginosa strains and A. flos-aquae tolerated lower temperatures than C. raciborskii, suggesting that fitness differences at low temperature may be important in limiting the latter's spread. Furthermore, we found that nutrient availability strongly influenced thermal reaction norm shape: nitrogen deprivation lowered growth rates and decreased both low- and high-temperature tolerance, but did not affect the optimum temperature in C. raciborskii.
