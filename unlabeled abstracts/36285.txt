An Invasion Report of The New Zealand Mud Snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1843) in Turkish Freshwaters: Delice River and Kocabas Stream
This study is combined the data from two different studies that carried out different regions and time, presenting some information on the population structure (dominance, local distribution etc.) of Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1843). According to our data, this species was found in the four different localities in the Delice River with various population densities. However, only of small population was found in the Kocabas Stream. This species was the second dominant species in the Delice River with 31.43 % after Physella acuta (Draparnaud, 1805) (46.88%). On the other hand, the species was not reached noticeable aggregates in the Kocabas Stream. In this paper, supporting factors that paving the way P. antipodarum invasion are discussed for the study area.
