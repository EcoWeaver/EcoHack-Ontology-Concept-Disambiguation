Poleward range expansion of a non-indigenous bryozoan and new occurrences of exotic ascidians in southeast Alaska
We report a first record of the widely invasive bryozoan Bugula neritina in Ketchikan, Alaska (USA), on Revillagigedo Island (southeast Alaska). This represents the northernmost record of this fouling organism in the northeast Pacific Ocean. We also report a new occurrence of the solitary ascidian Ciona savignyi not found in Alaska since 1903, along with recent occurrences of the invasive colonial ascidians Botryllus schlosseri and Botrylloides violaceus in new localities. The high level of vessel traffic in this region and the precedent for historical ship-borne invasions worldwide suggest that future population growth and establishment of these taxa in the Ketchikan area could set the stage for further poleward range expansion, highlighting the need for continued monitoring.
