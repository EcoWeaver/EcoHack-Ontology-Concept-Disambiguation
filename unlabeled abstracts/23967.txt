Nonchemical Methods for Paragrass (Urochloa mutica) Control
AbstractParagrass is a nonnative category I invasive species in central and south Florida. This perennial grass species outcompetes native vegetation and is capable of rapid spread by vegetative reproduction. Although glyphosate and imazapyr are effective herbicides for paragrass control, the use of herbicides in certain areas may be restricted because of application timing or environmental concerns. Therefore, our objectives were to examine the effect of water depth (saturated vs. flooded) after burning or cutting, and the effect of water depth and duration after simulated roller-chopping, on paragrass regrowth under controlled conditions. In the first study, paragrass plants were cut or burned with a propane burner to 1 cm (0.39 in) above the soil surface. Plants were either watered daily (control), or were subjected to one of two water treatments: water level at the soil surface (saturated) or flooded to a depth of 44 cm. Burned-saturated or burned-flooded plants had 92% less biomass 5 wk after treatment (WAT) than cut-saturated plants. Flooding resulted in plant death regardless of the plant treatment. In the second study, simulated roller-chopping was performed by cutting paragrass stolons into one-, two-, or three-node segments; planting them into flats; and subjecting them to water treatments for 3, 7, 14, 28, and 42 d. Burning, cutting, and roller-chopping could be useful to control paragrass if subsequent flooding is applied. Future research should focus on evaluating the response of these control techniques in natural areas where water depth can be managed.
