Plant-soil feedback during biological invasions: effect of litter decomposition from an invasive plant (Sphagneticola trilobata) on its native congener (S. calendulacea)
Abstract Plant invasions can affect soil properties in the invaded habitat by altering the biotic and abiotic nature of soils through positive or negative plant-soil feedback. Litter decomposition from many invasive species enhanced soil nutrients, thereby decreasing native plant diversity and leading to further plant invasions. Here, we examined the impact of litter decomposition from an invasive plant (Sphagneticola trilobata) in a range of soils at varying depths on growth and physiology of its native congener (Sphagneticola calendulacea). We added litter from S. trilobata to each soil type at different depths (0, 2, 4 and 6 cm). Plants of S. calendulacea were grown in each treatment, and morphological and physiological parameters were measured at the end of the growing period. All soils treated with litter displayed increases in soil nutrients at depths of 2 and 4 cm; while most growth traits, leaf chlorophyll and leaf nitrogen of S. calendulacea decreased at the same soil depths. Therefore, litter decomposition from invasive S. trilobata resulted in a positive plant-soil feedback for soil nutrients, and a negative plant-soil feedback for growth in native S. calendulacea. Our findings also suggest that the effects of litter decomposition from an invasive plant on soils and native species can vary significantly depending on the soil depth at which the litter is deposited. Future studies should focus on plant-soil feedback for more native and invasive species in invaded habitats, and the effects of invasive litter in more soil types and at greater soil depths.
