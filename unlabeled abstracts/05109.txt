Rhomboid proteases in invasion and replication of Apicomplexa
In this issue of Molecular Microbiology Rugarabamu and colleagues (Rugarabamu et al., 2015) investigate the role of rhomboid proteases responsible for adhesin shedding during invasion of the Apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. This study, together with several other recent publications, raises new questions about the function of these rhomboids in Toxoplasma, whilst also strongly arguing against other recently proposed roles for these proteases.
