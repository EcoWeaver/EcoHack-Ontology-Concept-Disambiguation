An appetite for invasion: digestive physiology, thermal performance, and food intake in lionfish (Pterois spp.)
Species invasions threaten global biodiversity, and physiological characteristics may determine their impact. Specific dynamic action (SDA; the increase in metabolic rate associated with feeding and digestion) is one such characteristic, strongly influencing an animal's energy budget and feeding ecology. We investigated the relationship between SDA, scope for activity, metabolic phenotype, temperature, and feeding frequency in lionfish (Pterois spp.), an invasive species to western Atlantic marine ecosystems. Intermittent-flow respirometry was used to determine SDA, scope for activity, and metabolic phenotype at 26degC and 32degC. Maximum metabolic rate occurred during digestion, as opposed to exhaustive exercise as in more athletic species. SDA and its duration (SDAdur) was 30% and 45% lower at 32degC than 26degC, respectively, and lionfish ate 42% more at 32degC. Despite a 32% decline in scope for activity from 26degC to 32degC, aerobic scope may have increased by 24%, as there was a higher range between standard metabolic rate (SMR) and peak SDA (the maximum postprandial metabolic rate). Individuals with high SMR and low scope for activity phenotypes had a less costly SDA and shorter SDAdur but a higher SDApeak. Feeding frequently had a lower and more consistent cost than consuming a single meal, but increased SDApeak. These findings demonstrate that: 1) lionfish are robust physiological performers in terms of SDA and possibly aerobic scope at temperatures approaching their thermal maximum, 2) lionfish may consume more prey as oceans warm with climate change, and 3) metabolic phenotype and feeding frequency may be important mediators of feeding ecology in fish.
