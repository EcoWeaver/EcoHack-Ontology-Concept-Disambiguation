Alloionema similis n. sp., a genetically divergent sibling species of A. appendiculatum Schneider, 1859 (Rhabditida: Alloionematidae) from invasive slugs in California, USA
A new species of Alloionema Schneider, 1859, A. similis n. sp., and the known species A. appendiculatum Schneider, 1859 were isolated from cadavers of invasive slugs in California. Both species are described based on morphology, morphometrics and molecular data. Alloionema similis n. sp. is morphologically very similar to A. appendiculatum but can be distinguished by a more posterior position of the excretory pore in the Kleinform females and longer tail in the Kleinform males. Substantial differences between the two species are, however, found in both 18S and 28S rDNA sequences. Sequence analysis revealed unambiguous autapomorphies in nucleotide sequence and secondary structure of rRNA genes, separating A. appendiculatum and A. similis n. sp. Molecular phylogenies were inferred from concatenated secondary-structure based multiple sequence alignments of nearly complete 18S and the D1-D3 domains of the 28S rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analyses placed these two species as sister taxa in a monophyletic clade, separately from Neoalloionema tricaudatum Ivanova, Pham Van Luc & Spiridonov, 2016 and N. indicum Nermut, Puza & Mracek, 2016.
