Mechanism for the re-invasion of an estuary by two species of brachyuran megalopae
Callinectes sapidus and Uca spp. megalopae were sampled extensively during September 1985 and August to October 1986 in a secondary estuary near the mouth of Delaware Bay, USA. Collections taken every 2 h over as many as 12 consecutive tidal cycles indicate that megalopae of both species were significantly more abundant in the water column during flood than ebb tides, and that maximum abundance occurred during nocturnal flood tides. This pattern of abundance provides a mechanism for upstream transport of megalopae by flooding tidal currents. Seasonal peaks in abund- ance of megalopae corresponded to periods in coastal set-up; this suggests that megalopae are dependant on wind-driven exchange for transport into the estuary from the adjacent continental shelf. The coincidence of wind events resulting in coastal set-up with the occurrence of patches of megalopae near the mouths of estuaries may be responsible for much of the inter- and intra-annual variation in recruitment in these taxa.
