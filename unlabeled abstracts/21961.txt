Turn bane into a boon: Application of invasive plant species to remedy soil cadmium contamination
Cadmium (Cd) is one of the mostly hazardous soil pollutants and has threatened human health by accumulating in grains of crops. Phytoremediation is a promising technique to remedy soil Cd contamination, but reported Cd hyperaccumulators remain limited. In this study, we explored potential applicability of three invasive plant species (Chromolaena odorata, Bidens pilosa and Praxelis clematidea) to remove soil Cd using greenhouse experiment. Results showed that the three species grew well with Cd treatments compared to the controlled individuals, suggesting that the species had high Cd tolerance by physiological adjustments such as up-regulating the antioxidant enzyme activities. The only exception was that the height of P. clematidea in the 60 mg kg-1 Cd treatment was less than that in the control. Within the tested Cd concentration range, the C. odorata exhibited high bioaccumulation characteristics that meet the recommended standards to identify as a hyperaccumulator (shoot Cd concentration > 100 mg kg-1 with bioconcentration and transfer factors > 1). The other two species had also the shoot bioconcentration factor and transfer factor greater than one, while the shoot Cd concentration was relatively lower. Our results highlight a potential applicability of the invasive species used in this study for remediation of the soil Cd contamination, which turns bane into a boon.
