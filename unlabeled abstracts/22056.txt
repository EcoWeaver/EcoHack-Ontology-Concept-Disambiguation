Resolving natural ranges and marine invasions in a globally distributed octocoral (genus Carijoa)
The first published report of the invasive snowflake coral in Hawai'i comes from Pearl Harbor in 1972; subsequent identification as the Caribbean octocoral Carijoa riisei led to the general conclusion that it was introduced to Hawai'i via maritime vectors. In an attempt to confirm the source of the Hawaiian population, we used mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear (nDNA) sequence data to compare Hawaiian populations with samples of Carijoa (n = 244) collected worldwide. In addition, cumulative vessel traffic patterns from 1940-1979 were compiled for the Pacific Ocean to determine maritime connectivity to and from Hawai'i during the assumed time of introduction. Carijoa sampled from throughout Hawai'i (n = 96) share none of the Caribbean mtDNA haplotypes and only a single nDNA allele (of 28 each), indicating that the Hawaiian populations derive from Indo-Pacific rather than Caribbean-Atlantic origins. Further, both mtDNA and nDNA show significant isolation-by-distance patterns overall and among the Pacific and Hawaiian sampling regions. These data imply that Carijoa is native to the Indo-Pacific. Published reports of geographically wide-ranging invasions of Carijoa throughout the Pacific appear unfounded because our global sampling shows higher mtDNA (h = 0.84;
