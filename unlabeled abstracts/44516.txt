Intensive Agricultural Practices as Enhancers of the Dispersion of Invasive Species: Notification of the Observation of a Case with Robinia pseudoacacia L. in Alentejo (Southern Portugal)
Invasive forest species are a recurring problem, which in Portugal assume a somewhat mediatic role, both because of the impacts they cause on biodiversity, but also because they enhance the accumulation of high amounts of fuel load, increasing the risk of forest fires. However, in some areas of the country, such as the Alentejo (South of Portugal), the scarcity of water did not allow, until now, the dispersion and rapid growth of some of these species, namely Robinia pseudoacacia, which has always remained under control, and it was never a real problem. However, with the growth of intensive farming practices, associated with vineyards, olive groves and almond trees, water and nutrients became available, enabling this species to grow and disperse. This communication presents an observation of several sets of R. pseudoacacia specimens growing with different agricultural holdings, raising the hypothesis that intensive farming practices may, in the short term, contribute to the dispersion of invasive species in regions where they were not a problem, if the situations reported are not followed up and studies are carried out to confirm the observations described.
