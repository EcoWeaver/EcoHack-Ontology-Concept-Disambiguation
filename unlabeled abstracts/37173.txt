A new alien fish in the Mediterranean Sea - Platax teira (Forsskal, 1775) (Osteichthyes: Ephippidae)
A single Platax teira (Forsskal, 1775) specimen was captured off Bodrum (southern Aegean Sea, Turkey) on 5 March 2006. It is the first record of this fish species in the Mediterranean Sea. Introduction of the species is probably due to an aquarium release.
