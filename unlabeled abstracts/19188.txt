Competitive interaction between the exotic plant Rhus typhina L. and the native tree Quercus acutissima Carr. in Northern China under different soil N:P ratios
Background and aims Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) input has changed the relative importance of nutrient elements. This study aimed to examine the effects of different nutrient conditions on the interaction between exotic and native plants. Methods We conducted a greenhouse experiment with a native species Quercus acutissima Carr. and an exotic species Rhus typhina L. grown in monocultures or mixtures, under three N:P ratios (5, 15 and 45 corresponding to N-limited, basic N and P supply and P-limited conditions, respectively). After 12 weeks of treatment, traits related to biomass allocation, leaf physiology and nutrient absorption were determined. Results R. typhina was dominant under competition, with a high capacity for carbon assimilation and nutrient absorption, and the dominance was unaffected by increasing N:P ratios. R. typhina invested more photosynthate in leaves and more nutrients in the photosynthetic apparatus, enabling high biomass production. Q. acutissima invested more photosynthate in roots and more nutrients in leaf persistence at the expense of reduced carbon assimilation capacity. Conclusions Different trade-offs in biomass and nutrient allocation of the two species is an important reason for their distinct performances under competition and helps R. typhina to maintain dominance under different nutrient conditions.
