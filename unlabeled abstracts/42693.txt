Genetic diversity of the invasive plant <i>Coreopsis grandiflora</i> at different altitudes in Laoshan Mountain, China
In order to understand the relationship between genetic diversity and the invasiveness of exotic plants, genetic diversity was studied in the invasive plant Coreopsis grandiflora Hogg. at different altitudes in Laoshan Mountain, Northern China. Coreopsis grandiflora has produced a great deal of damage in Laoshan Mountain. Its genetic diversity was examined using 16 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers, and 125 bands were collected from all individuals. The mean percentage of polymorphic loci (P%) was 39.54%, and the total percentage of polymorphic loci (P%) was 86.40%. The mean Shannon's Information index (H0) was 0.2326 and the mean Nei's genetic diversity (H) was 0.1596. These results indicated a comparatively high genetic diversity in C. grandiflora in Laoshan Mountain. The genetic differentiation among populations (GST) was 0.3948, indicating that most genetic diversity occurs within populations. On the whole, the abundance and the genetic diversity of C. grandiflora decreased with increasing altitude. The high genetic diversity may be related to the invasion of C. grandiflora in Laoshan Mountain.
