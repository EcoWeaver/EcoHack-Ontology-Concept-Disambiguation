Exotic species and estuaries: managing Spartina anglica in Tasmania, Australia
The spread of exotic Spartina anglica (rice grass) occurs in temperate estuaries of the USA, UK, Netherlands, France, China, New Zealand and Australia. In Australia S. anglica infestations are found in the southern States of Tasmania and Victoria. The ecological, social and economic costs associated with its continued spread in Tasmania have resulted in the development of a management program supporting eradication and control. The paper begins by outlining the suite of problems associated with the management of exotic S. anglica infestations. The legislative framework for S. anglica is then critically evaluated. Recent developments that facilitate integrated coastal zone management are presented and assessed with respect to S. anglica. The paper makes recommendations on resolving legislative and institutional responsibility, promoting sustainable development practices in the coastal zone and raising the profile of environmental and aquatic weeds such as S. anglica.
