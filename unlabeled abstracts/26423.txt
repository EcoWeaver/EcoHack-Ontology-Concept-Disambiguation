Species Composition and Distribution of Invasive Ponto-Caspian Amphipods in the Off-Channel Microhabitats of a Temperate, Lowland Dam Reservoir
The Wloclawek Dam Reservoir located on the lower Vistula River (central Poland) is part of the central corridor used by Ponto-Caspian species to migrate in Europe. It provides a number of habitats suitable for sustaining populations of several non-indigenous taxa. Four Ponto-Caspian amphipod species were recorded in the reservoir: Chaetogammarus ischnus, Chelicorophium curvispinum, Dikerogammarus haemobaphes and Pontogammarus robustoides. We found significant differences in amphipod densities and species composition among various microhabitats in off-channel areas. P. robustoides was the only amphipod species that occurred on very shallow (<1 m) sandy bottom near the shore. It inhabited also other sites but its share in the total number of amphipods and abundance decreased with the distance from the shore. Furthermore, at sites more distant from shore its affinity for plant substratum was higher. D. haemobaphes, C. ischnus and C. curvispinum clearly preferred sites distant from shore, overgrown by macrophytes or covered by mussel shells. Furthermore, the abundance of C. ischnus was negatively correlated with the presence of P. robustoides. ((c) 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)
