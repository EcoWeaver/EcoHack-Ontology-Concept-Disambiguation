The Australian feather-duster worm Laonome calida Capa, 2007 (Annelida: Sabellidae) introduced into European inland waters?
Laonome calida Capa, 2007, a feather-duster worm discovered in 2007 in estuaries and open water of tropical and subtropical Australia, was recently found at many locations in fresh and brackish waters of the delta region of the rivers Rhine, Meuse, and Scheldt in the Netherlands. Morphological differences between specimens from Australia and the Netherlands are insufficient to warrant specific distinction. A recent translocation from Australia to Europe, or from a third country to both, may explain the disjunct distribution of this species. A table with translocated and cryptogenic sabellids reported to date is provided.
