Response of Native Species 10 Years After Rat Eradication on Anacapa Island, California
Abstract Measuring the response of native species to conservation actions is necessary to inform continued improvement of conservation practices. This is particularly true for eradications of invasive vertebrates from islands where up-front costs are high, actions may be controversial, and there is potential for negative impacts to native ("nontarget") species. We summarize available data on the response of native species on Anacapa Island, California, 10 y after the eradication of invasive black rats Rattus rattus. Native marine taxa hypothesized to respond positively to rat eradication increased in abundance (Scripps's murrelet Synthliboramphus scrippsi; International Union for Conservation of Nature Vulnerable, and intertidal invertebrates). Two seabird species likely extirpated by rats--ashy storm-petrel Oceanodroma homochroa (International Union for Conservation of Nature Endangered) and Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus--are now confirmed to breed on the island. Long-term negative effects from nontarget impacts are limited. Rufous-crowned sparrows Aimophila ruficeps obscura are still present, although likely in lower abundance. The endemic Anacapa deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus anacapae population increased with no loss in heterozygosity, but with reduced genetic differentiation on East Anacapa and the loss of some alleles across the islets. Intertidal invertebrate cover increased while algal cover decreased. These findings clarify the pervasive effects of invasive rats on a wide variety of taxa, the short- and long-term impacts of eradication, and the ability of some island fauna to passively recover following a carefully planned rat-eradication project.
