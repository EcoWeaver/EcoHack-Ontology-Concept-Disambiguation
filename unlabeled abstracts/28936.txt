Structural characterization of vegetative organs of the endangered Brazilian native species Hesperozygis ringens (Benth.) Epling
The aim of this study was to describe the structural characterization of Hesperozygis ringens (Benth.) Epling vegetative organs. For this purpose, leaves, stems and roots of the endangered Lamiaceae were collected from a population located in Santo Antao, Santa Maria municipality, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Results demonstrated that the H. ringens leaf blade presents glandular and non-glandular trichomes as well as two morphs of diallelocytic stomata, which are usually found above the epidermis level. The petiole is concave on ventral face and convex on its dorsal face, containing glandular and non-glandular trichomes as well as stomata in the epidermis. These types of trichomes were also detected in the stem. In addition, the presence of intercellular spaces within the organ is highlighted. Stomata above epidermis level also occurred in the stem. Phenolic idioblasts were found in the cortical region of plant root and deposit of lipophilic substance was observed in phloem cells. Great amount of apparently two different crystals were detected in all organs. Information obtained in this study provides knowledge about the characterizationof H. ringens, which may be used to distinguish characters of taxa and can help understand the species survival in its occurrence sites.
