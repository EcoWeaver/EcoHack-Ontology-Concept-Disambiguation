DNA in a bottle-Rapid metabarcoding survey for early alerts of invasive species in ports.
Biota monitoring in ports is increasingly needed for biosecurity reasons and safeguarding marine biodiversity from biological invasions. Present and future international biosecurity Directives can be accomplished only if the biota acquired by maritime traffic in ports is controlled. Methodologies for biota inventory are diverse and now rely principally on laborious extensive sampling and taxonomic identification by experts. In this study we have employed an extremely simplified eDNA sampling methodology based on only two 1L bottles of water per port, followed by NGS Metabarcoding using 18S rDNA and cytochrome oxidase I as genetic barcodes. Eight Bay of Biscay ports with available inventory of fouling invertebrates were employed as a case study. Three invasive invertebrates were detected: the barnacle Austrominius modestus, the tubeworm Ficopomatus enigmaticus and the polychaete Polydora triglanda, the latter occurring in very low density from visual inventory, despite minimal sampling effort. Current costs of visual surveys, conventional Barcoding and this simplified Metabarcoding protocol were compared. The results encourage the use of Metabarcoding for early biosecurity alerts.
