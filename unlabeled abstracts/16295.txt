Development and characterization of microsatellite loci for Rhinella marina (Amphibia, Bufonidae) and their transferability to two closely related species
The Neotropical cane toad, Rhinella marina, is known worldwide due to its catastrophic introduction into Australia as a biological control agent. In the present study, we developed 12 new microsatellites through the standardization of four multiplex PCRs. These loci were highly polymorphic, and were transferred successfully to two other species of the R. marina complex, R. jimi and R. schneideri. In both species levels of polymorphism were similar to those found in R. marina, and thus are promising markers for future population genetic studies. In addition, the possibility of amplifying by multiplex the three species simultaneously it will be of particular interest for detailed analysis of hybridization patterns.
