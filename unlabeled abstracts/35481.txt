Why is arabica coffee visited by so few non-Apis bees in its native range?
The current knowledge about pollinators in sub-Saharan Africa is extremely scarce. General pollinator distributions and resource usages are mainly unknown, as are the main pollinators of different crops (Timberlake and Morgan 2018). In early 2011, I travelled to an Afromontane area of Ethiopia, where arabica coffee, Coffea arabica L., has its origin, to survey coffee pollinators. I surveyed 19 coffee sites, most managed with organic practices, across a gradient from state-owned, shaded semi-plantation coffee to coffee grown sparsely, more or less wild, in the understory of disturbed natural forests (Fig 1a, b).
