REPORT OF A NEW INVASIVE ALGA IN THE ATLANTIC UNITED STATES: "HETEROSIPHONIA" JAPONICA IN RHODE ISLAND1
Recent collections of tetrasporangiate "Heterosiphonia" japonica Yendo from Watch Hill to Point Judith, Rhode Island, represent the first report of this nonnative alga in the western Atlantic. Native to the Pacific Ocean, this species was unintentionally introduced into European waters by 1984 and has subsequently invaded the eastern Atlantic Ocean widely from France to Norway and south into the Mediterranean Sea. Thus far, all western Atlantic collections of this species are confined to the outer coast of Rhode Island, and at present are not found in Narragansett Bay or in Long Island Sound along the Connecticut coast. Molecular and morphological studies confirm the identity of this newly introduced invasive species.
