Growth parameters of Poecilia latipinna (Lesueur, 1821) (Actinopterygii, Poeciilidae) - an introduced species in brackish water of Wadi Al-Bahayes (Oman)
Abstract This work is one of the first studies on the growth of Poecilia latipinna outside its natural habitat. The objective of our study was to investigate the growth parameters of the population of P. latipinna, which is an alien species in Oman (Wadi Al-Bahayes). The population structure of P. latipinna in Wadi Al-Bahayes (Oman; 23deg40'47''N; 58deg11'36''E) was studied in June and August 2020, using 124 fish. In the course of this study, the number of individuals of each sex, age, weight and size composition were determined. In addition, the total length-weight relationship (LRW) was calculated, as well as the von Bertalanffy growth equation. The mean growth performance (phi prime) and the condition factor were calculated. Males accounted for 37.10% and females for 62.90% of the population. The length-weight relationship and the von Bertalanffy growth equation were W = 0.0214 x L 2.7889 R2 = 0.9212, Lt = 11.46 (1 - e -0.127 (t + 2.71)) for males and Lt = 14.51 (1 - e-0.072 (t + 3.98)) for females. The mean growth performance and the condition factor were calculated as 1.22 for males and 1.18 for females and 1.54 for all specimens. The study shows that the population of the species is characterized by a wide age range. Consequently, monitoring of this alien species is highly recommended.
