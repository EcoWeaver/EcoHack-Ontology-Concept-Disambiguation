African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) in Baja California: a confirmed population and possible ongoing invasion in Mexican watersheds
The African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) is an invasive amphibian in at least 15 countries. In Mexico, only occasional records have documented it in the state of Baja California. In May 2013, we discovered a population at Puente el Morro in Rosarito. In a 1-h session of trapping, we captured 106 individuals (adults and juveniles) at a small pond. We did not see eggs, tadpoles, or reproductive activity, but lengths of frogs indicate that some have reached sexual maturity. This discovery indicates the need for conservation plans and action against X. laevis dispersion, especially in Mediterranean zone climates.
