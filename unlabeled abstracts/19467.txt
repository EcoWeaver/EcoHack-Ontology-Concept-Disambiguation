Species richness of tree and shrub layers in riparian forests of the Western Caucasus dominated by alien species
The consequences of replacement of native dominants by alien species (Ailanthus altissima, Ficus carica, Robinia pseudoacacia, Acer negundo, and Amorpha fruticosa) in the tree and shrub layers have been studied in riparian forests of the Western Caucasus. The results show that the invasive dominant species do not always achieve higher abundance, compared with native dominants. When this is the case, however, the dominance of alien species as stronger competitors leads to reduction in the species richness of communities, because they not only intercept the greater part of resources from the environment but also provoke increasingly strict partitioning of remaining resources among associated species.
