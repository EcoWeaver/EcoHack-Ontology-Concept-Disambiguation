Confirmation of the exotic status of Marphysa victori Lavesque, Daffe, Bonifacio & Hutchings, 2017 (Annelida) in French waters and synonymy of Marphysa bulla Liu, Hutchings & Kupriyanova, 2018
The bait worm Marphysa victori Lavesque, Daffe, Bonifacio & Hutchings, 2017 was originally described from Arcachon Bay, France. In the original description, the authors suggested that it may have been introduced, although definitive evidence was lacking at the time. In this paper, we confirm that M. victori is an exotic species originating from East Asia, probably a native of China or Japan. This species was most likely introduced into Arcachon Bay in the 1970s with non-native oysters Crassostrea gigas Thunberg, 1793. The Asiatic origin of this species is confirmed based on both morphological and molecular evidence. Comparison of the type specimens of M. victori with those of Marphysa bulla Liu, Hutchings & Kupriyanova, 2018 described from the Yellow Sea, China, showed no morphological or molecular differences and therefore the more recently named M. bulla is relegated to a junior synonym. This is the first example of a large-sized errant invertebrate species being introduced with oysters into Arcachon Bay.
