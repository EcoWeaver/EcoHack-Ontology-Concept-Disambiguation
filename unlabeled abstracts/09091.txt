Temporal analysis of the Brussels flora as indicator for changing environmental quality
With their species diversity, their population abundance and their integrator characters, higher plants represent useful tools to solve problems concerning the environment analysis and management. As they are good bioindicators, plants integrate many environmental parameters and can help to reveal the misworking of the ecosystems. Within this framework, a recent and complete survey of the phanerogamic flora of the Brussels area was carried out by the method of the floristic grid-map based on 1 km -- squares. A comparison with earlier data has allowed us to appreciate the consequences of half a century of human activities on plant diversity in the urban ecosystem. The basic aim is to present a method of diagnosis and mapping that has been used, so as to turn the descriptive information about the biological environment of the area into a series of guidelines for land-use regulation and management within the city.
