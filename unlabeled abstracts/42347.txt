Development of Invasive Plant Recognition System Based on Deep Learning
A major ecological issue that has seriously harmed both human society and the environment is the invasion of alien plants. To stop the invasion of alien plants, it is crucial to create an effective and precise monitoring and early warning system. In this situation, deep learning and computer vision have significant potential to enhance plant monitoring on a wide scale. This study suggests a deep learning-based approach for identifying invasive plants. The user interface is developed as a mobile application (APP). The identification result can be acquired in 1 to 2 seconds after downloading the plant image from the APP, uploading it to the server, and using the convolutional neural network (CNN). The system had an average accuracy of 90.39% on the test set thanks to data augmentation and enhanced networks. The deep learning-based invasive plant identification system created in this study has demonstrated through experiments that it may effectively support botanical research and ecological environment monitoring.
