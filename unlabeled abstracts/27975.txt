Overwintering, phenology and fecundity of Harmonia axyridis in comparison with native coccinellid species in Italy
Classical biological control is generallyunderstood as an environmentally safe practiceof insect pest management. However, questionshave been raised about possible negativeeffects for native species. As part of a riskassessment study a semi-field trial was carriedout in northern Italy in order to compare theoverwintering of the native species Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (L.) and Adalia bipunctata (L.) (Coleoptera:Coccinellidae) with the exotic Harmoniaaxyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae).All the experiments were carried out from April1998 to April 2001. Harmonia axyridis wasable to overwinter successfully in northernItaly. Fecundity, oviposition rate, longevityand rate of increase of overwintering femaleswere calculated and the phenology of the threespecies was studied. Harmonia axyridisoverwintering mortality (31.9%) was lower incomparison with mortality of native species(68.9% for P. quatuordecimpunctata and61.3% for A. bipunctata). As aconsequence, post-overwintering rate ofincrease of the exotic species was higher.Longevity of overwintered females was similaramong the species. Mean fecundity of H. axyridis (783.8 eggs per female) was slightlyhigher than A. bipunctata (720.2 eggs perfemale), and much higher than P. quatuordecimpunctata (193.7 eggs per female). H. axyridis and A. bipunctatacompleted four generations and P. quatuordecimpunctata three generations in a year. The results show that H. axyridisappears to posses a high potential for establishment in Italy.
