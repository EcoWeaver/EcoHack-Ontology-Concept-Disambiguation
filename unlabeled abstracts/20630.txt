Does research information meet the needs of stakeholders? Exploring evidence selection in the global management of invasive species
This study explored factors affecting information selection by international stakeholders working with invasive species. Despite differences in information requirements between groups, all stakeholders demonstrated a clear preference for free, easily accessible online information, and predominantly used internet search engines and specialist websites to find information. A reliance on experience, rather than scientific evidence, was identified, suggesting that underlying knowledge transfer issues relate to accessing and translating research evidence. This is consistent with other sectors. Research information potentially meets the needs of invasive species stakeholders, but following simple dissemination actions outlined here could help to ensure that relevant research evidence is selected to inform decision making.
