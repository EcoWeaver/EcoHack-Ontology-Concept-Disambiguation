Inter-regional hybrids of native and non-native Centaurea sulphurea inherit increased competitive ability from the non-natives
Background: Exotic species can rapidly develop adaptations to their non-native regions, such as increased size and competitive ability. Although these traits are believed to be responsible for invasive success, some non-invasive exotic species display them too. This suggests that they might be necessary but not sufficient to turn an exotic into a successful invader. Aim: To assess size and competitive ability of the exotic non-invasive weed C. sulphurea, and of inter-regional hybrids between native and non-native populations. Methods: We experimentally produced a cohort of Centaurea sulphurea individuals from the native range of the species in Spain, from its non-native range in California, as well as hybrids between the two regions. We grew these plants in pots in competition with the grass Bromus hordeaceus, or alone in control pots. Results: Individuals from California were larger and better competitors than individuals from Spain. Furthermore, inter-regional hybrids showed competitive responses similar to that of individuals from California. Conclusions: Our results confirm that increased competitive ability might be more frequent than previously thought among introduced species, since it can be detected in at least some exotic non-invasive species. They also illustrate the importance of maternal effects, how locally adapted traits are conserved and spread in the non-native ranges of exotic species, and suggest that plant size and competitive ability are not directly associated in this species.
