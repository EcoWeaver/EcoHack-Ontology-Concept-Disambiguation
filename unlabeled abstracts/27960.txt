Effects of an alien fish, Gambusia affinis, on an endemic California fairy shrimp, Linderiella occidentalis: implications for conservation of diversity in fishless waters
The introduction of exotic fishes to naturally fishless waters is often associated with declines in species native to those waters. Mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, have been introduced to waters worldwide for mosquito control. Taxa negatively affected by mosquitofish potentially include fairy shrimp (Crustacea: Anostraca) that often show high rates of endemism, and which are characteristic of naturally fishless wetlands on every continent. We tested the effects of mosquitofish on a fairy shrimp, Linderiella occidentalis, in experimental ponds that included a community of native aquatic invertebrates. We supplemented field experiments with lab trials to test whether mosquitofish preferred L. occidentalis to other prey. Survival of the fairy shrimp was significantly reduced in ponds with mosquitofish. Only 16.9% of fairy shrimp survived in ponds with mosquitofish, while 64.0% survived in control ponds. Fish presence also reduced abundance and biomass of other invertebrates. Results from feeding trials demonstrated that mosquitofish frequently prefer L. occidentalis to alternative prey. Our results suggest that introduction of mosquitofish into naturally fishless wetlands may lead to loss of diversity of their highly specialized aquatic fauna.
