Use of native species Crenicichla menezesi (Ariidae) as a model for in situ evaluation of genotoxicity in surface water
The aim of this work was to analyze the genotoxicity in surface water from the Pitimbu River (Natal, Brazil) using a neotropical species Crenicichla menezesi as bioindicator for in situ evaluation. The genotoxicity was analyzed using the micronucleus (MN) and comet assays in erythrocytes. The animals were collected from five sites of the river. A significant increase of MN frequency and comet class L1 to L4 were observed only in specimens collected from three sampling sites (SS3, SS4 and SS5) located into urban areas. These same sites also presented high metals concentration. Correlation of DNA damage and concentrations of Cu (Spearman r=0.8080), Cr (Spearman r=0.9772), and Ni (Spearman r=0.9909) were observed. These data indicate the presence of genotoxic agents. Moreover the C. menezesi species showed to be a good indicator for prompt analyses since this species presents sedentary and carnivore habits.
