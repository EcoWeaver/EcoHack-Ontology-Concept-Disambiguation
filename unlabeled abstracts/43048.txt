Invasive Plants May Adapt to Climate Change Better than Native Species
in Timmins bloomed 20 days earlier in the spring and remained small and, in doing so, maximized seed production in the shorter growing season. These local plants also yielded up to 37 times as many fruits as the southern plant grown at the same location. In contrast, the northern Ontario plants that were grown in Virginia averaged only a quarter of the seeds of the locally adapted purple loosestrife because of their earlier flowering when they were still very small. Barrett and Colautti concluded that the purple loosestrife's adaptations to different climates through changes in size and flowering times were just as important as the lack of natural pests in determining their ability to thrive. In addition, the plant was found not only to have adapted to a drastically different climate as it migrated but to have evolved this ability in a matter of mere decades. Colautti notes that the purple loosestrife found in North America contains far more genetic variability than the purple loosestrife indigenous to Europe, Asia, Africa, and parts of
