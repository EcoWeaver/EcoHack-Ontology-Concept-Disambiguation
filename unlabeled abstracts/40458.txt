Invasion of Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774) (Bivalvia: Corbiculidae) in water bodies from the East Aegean River Basin in Bulgaria
Two decades after the first record of the invasive mussel Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774) in Bulgaria in 2001, it has been found in many surface lotic and standing waters in the Bulgarian Danube River Basin. The aim of the current study is to report the finding of C. fluminea in lotic environment of the East Aegean water basin in Bulgaria. Six new localities of the mussel, all situated in the lower stretches of the Tundzha (two) and Maritsa (four) River were registered. The distributional patterns of the mussel and the abundance of its populations in relation to the environmental conditions were analyzed. The adaptive character of the Corbicula, the possible path for invasion as well as the probability of rapid spread of the mussel in the largest rivers and their tributary systems in south-eastern part of Balkan Peninsula was discussed.
