Here today, gone tomorrow: declines and local extinctions of invasive ant populations in the absence of intervention
Invasive species are known to exhibit boom and bust cycles. We report population declines of one of the world's most serious ant invaders, Anoplolepis gracilipes (Smith) (yellow crazy ant) in Arnhem Land, Australia. Anoplolepis gracilipes populations are known to fluctuate, both spatially and temporally, but this is the first instance of quantitative monitoring of spatial declines of entire populations. We present before and after survey data on seven populations that have either declined substantially or disappeared completely without human intervention. Sites ranged in size from 1.8 ha to 15 ha. Although the mechanistic cause of these declines remains unknown, A. gracilipes populations in Arnhem Land represent a unique opportunity to investigate mechanisms by which a globally significant invader declines, which could have important implications for invasive species management worldwide.
