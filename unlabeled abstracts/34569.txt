Vegetation Changes Associated With Invasion by Phytophthora cinnamomi on Monitored Sites in the Grampians, Western Australia
The effects of invasion by Phytophthora cinnamomi were measured on sites representing the larger forest regions of the Grampians. Changes were obvious at first, with the death of more than 50% of the species including large plants such as Xanthorrhoea australis, but soon became dificult to detect as susceptible species were replaced by field-resistant graminoids. Reductions were assessed in species heterogeneity and plant density during 1976, at the onset of disease and from 1977 to 1984. Susceptible species disappeared from infested forest and no re-emergence was observed. Less-susceptible plants such as some Euca/yptus spp. declined in number, regeneration and size, due to deaths or dieback of the branches. Reductions in tree canopy and the loss of structural dominants of the understorey caused changes in the flora which are likely to persist. The survival of rare, susceptible endemic species may be endangered. On dry, steep slopes the dead plants were not replaced and the amount of bare ground increased causing erosion of the soil surface. Some graminoid species increased in abundance on level, infested sites, resulting in a different species composition but with both species heterogeneity and plant density numerically similar to the previous flora.
