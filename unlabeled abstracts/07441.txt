Minimizing invader impacts: striking the right balance between removal and restoration
Invasive species can cause severe damage in their introduced range; this damage often persists even after removal of the invader. In order to efficiently allocate a limited budget between invader removal and restoration of habitat from which the invader has been removed, it is vital to quantify the impacts of the invasion within an economic context. Here we develop optimal management strategies for biological invasions, which minimize both the direct economic costs of removal and restoration, and the ecological costs of present and future damage caused by the invasion. We demonstrate how this can be formulated as a linear programming problem, enabling the fast and efficient computation of optimal solutions. Using a simple example, we outline some general principles for the optimal control of an invader that damages its environment. Notably, we show that the most effective strategies often switch the priority of removal and restoration over time, and outline the conditions under which restoration is prioritized over removal. The proportion of total funds allocated to restoration will depend on the annual budget, the persistence of damage, and the relative costs of damage, removal and restoration.
