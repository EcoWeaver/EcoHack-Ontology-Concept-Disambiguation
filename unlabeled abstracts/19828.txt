Interactions of the introduced rotan Perccottus glenii Dybowski, 1877 (Osteichthyes, Odontobutidae) with aboriginal fish species: The parasitological aspect
This study was conducted in the water filled Neverovo sandpit, located in Ruza district of Moscow province. This water body is inhabited by 6 fish species, including the introduced rotan. Twelve species of parasites were recorded in/on the rotan, and most of them circulate using aboriginal fish species. Reliable evidence of the involvement of the rotan in the circulation of a parasite species native to the water body-recipient (Ergasilus sieboldi) was obtained for the first time. Rotan does not play a significant role in the circulation of 11 other parasite species, or, at least, quantity estimations of its role were not yet undertaken.
