Australian scallops do not recognise the introduced predatory seastar Asterias amurensis
Escape responses of Australian scallops (Pecten fumatus and Chlamys asperrima) to native and introduced predatory seastars were compared in laboratory and field trials. The native seastar Coscinasterias muricata elicited an almost immediate escape response by scallops in all trials. In contrast, there was a low frequency of escape response exhibited by scallops when held in contact with the introduced seastar Asterias amurensis. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that escape response in invertebrates has evolved relative to predation risk. The absence of predator recognition in marine invertebrates may have serious implications for wild and farmed populations in southern Australia where introduced predators are prevalent.
