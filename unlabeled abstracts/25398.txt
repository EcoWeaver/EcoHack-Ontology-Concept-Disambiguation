Shifts in aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity associated with the presence and size of an alien crayfish
To investigate the effects of Procambarus clarkii on macroinvertebrate diversity, we conducted a mesocosm experiment simulating small pools in rice field pads after the rice season. We hypothesized that crayfish predation would negatively impact macroinvertebrate diversity, and the magnitude of this impact should vary with the size of P. clarkii. We conducted a short-term mesocosm experiment to determine macroinvertebrate diversity in the presence of three size classes and in the absence of crayfish, as well as the diet composition of crayfish from the three size classes. At the end of the experiments, the diet of crayfish was composed of the most available taxa (Culicidae, Chironomus, Tanytarsini and Orthocladinae). These results also show evidence that, in confined areas, crayfish are important predators of major rice pests such as rice Chironominae larvae. Macroinvertebrate diversity was negatively affected by crayfish presence, but the effect was inversely proportional to crayfish size. The highest diversity index was obtained in the absence of P. clarkii, and juvenile crayfish significantly reduced macroinvertebrate diversity. Thus, the impact of P. clarkii on aquatic macroinvertebrates is size dependent and may be relevant in small pools formed in rice field pads from early autumn to late winter. Overall, our findings suggest that the negative effects of P. clarkii on macroinvertebrate diversity may be particularly strong in local natural assemblages confined to puddles of water or small ponds in wetland areas.
