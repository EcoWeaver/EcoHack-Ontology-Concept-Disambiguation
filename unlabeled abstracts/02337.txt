Viviparus acerosus (Bourguignat, 1862) (Gastropoda: Viviparidae), a new exotic snail species for the Dutch fauna
Viviparus acerosus, a Central European species originally inhabiting the Danube drainage system, is reported for the first time from The Netherlands. The species is commercially sold for gardens ponds or aquaria, from which they may have escaped or have been released. On account of its resemblance with the two native Viviparus species the species is easily overlooked.
