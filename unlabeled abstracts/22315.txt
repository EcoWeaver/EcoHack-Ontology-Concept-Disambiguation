Nitrogen stocks in a riparian area invaded by N-fixing black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.)
Fixation of river flow passages and riverbed degradation may facilitate the development of higher floodplains with the establishment of exotic species such as black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.). We quantitatively evaluated the relationship between nitrogen (N) levels in black locust trees and in sediments under different flood disturbance regimes in a riparian area of the Chikuma River. In this study, allometric equations were developed for relating leaf N content to diameter at breast height of black locust. The amount of leaf N in black locust increased with distance from the river, reaching 159kgNha-1 at 180m from the river. There was a small difference in N content between green and fallen leaves (0.2%), and so the leaf N was almost equivalent to N input to riparian sediments. Fine sediments accumulated on the riparian area, where the amount of sediments N increased with distance from the river, ranging from 1091+-767 to 4953+-2953kgNha-1. The N accumulation rates also increased with distance from the river, corresponding with the amount of leaf N in black locust per unit area, but the former exceeded the latter. The sediment N accumulation might be accelerated by sediment trapping effect due to riparian vegetation itself. A large input of N provided by invaded black locust might alter nutrient dynamics and native plant community structure in the riparian area.
