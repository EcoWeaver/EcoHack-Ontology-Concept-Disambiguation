Halogen biogeochemistry of invasive perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium) in a peatland pasture
Exotic invasive plants pose one of the greatest threats to native plant populations and communities, especially in the California floristic province. Many invasive plant species thrive on disturbed lands and alter the biogeochemical cycles of their ecosystem once established. In the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, large islands have been formed from the drainage of peatlands, now surrounded by levees and sectioned with drainage channels. One of these tracts, Sherman Island, is a heavily impacted pasture peatland that has a large coverage of perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium), an invasive plant that is widespread in the western United States and Canada. Like other members of the Brassicaceae family, L. latifolium has the capacity to produce methyl halides, halogenated compounds that destroy stratospheric ozone. In 2009-10, we conducted a yearlong study of methyl bromide (CH3Br) and methyl chloride (CH3Cl) fluxes at Sherman Island, using both field flux chambers and laboratory soil core incubations. A stable isotope tracer technique was employed to simultaneously quantify gross production and consumption rates, along with net fluxes. Methyl halide emission rates from this pasture were comparable to coastal salt marshes, with L. latifolium plants as the primary source and soils providing a minor contribution. Meanwhile, gross consumption of methyl halides in the soils were strongly affected by soil moisture and temperature. The temporal variability of fluxes was dominated overall by gross production, with plant biochemistry and environmental factors both playing important roles in regulating emissions.
