Potential of texture measurements of two-date dual polarization PALSAR data for the improvement of forest biomass estimation
The recently available space-borne SAR sensor, PALSAR, is more promising than its predecessor JERS-1 for biomass estimation because of its long wavelength (L-band), and its ability to provide data with different polarizations, varying incidence angles and higher spatial resolutions. This research investigates the potential of two-date dual polarization (HH and HV) SAR imagery for biomass estimation using different kinds of texture processing and different combinations of single and dual polarization ratios. The investigation is conducted in a mountainous, sub-tropical study area where biomass levels are far beyond the previously recognized saturation levels for L-band SAR images, and forest is a mixture of native and non-native species and plantations.
