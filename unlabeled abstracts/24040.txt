Can biological invasions induce desertification?
In years of high precipitation, invasive grasses can spread into the interspaces, thereby establishing connectivity either between shrub islands or between shrubs and the sparse cover of native perennial grasses in the interspaces. Grass connectivity provides conditions favorable for the spread of fires typically induced by lightning in the summer months. It has been found that the effect of fires on soil properties results in the enhancement of soil erodibility. Our studies on fire-affected grasslands and shrublands in the southwestern USA have shown that fires increase wind-erosion rates in burned areas and that the increase in soil-erosion rates was considerably higher for shrublands than for grasslands (Ravi et al., 2007; Ravi, 2008). The erodibilty of soils under burned shrub patches increased considerably after fire, whereas this postfire change in soil-erosion rates was negligible under grasses and bare interspaces. This enhancement of erosion processes was attributed to postfire soil water repellency induced by vegetation, as this effect was absent in adjacent unburned areas with similar surface roughness and experiencing the same exposure to wind and water. The burning vegetation releases some organic compounds that induce different levels of water repellency in the soil, which are dependent on several factors, such as vegetation type, soil properties, fire intensity and duration (Doerr et al., 2000). Soil water repellency has been shown to affect the adsorption and retention of moisture in the soil, with important impacts on the interparticle bonding forces (Ravi et al., 2006). The weakening of these forces makes the surface soil more susceptible to erosion by wind and water. Thus, it can be concluded that in these systems sediment transport interacts with disturbances, such as fires, to affect the rates of soil erosion and resource redistribution.
