New information on host plants and distribution ranges of an invasive gall midge, Contarinia maculipennis (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), and its congeners in Japan
Gall midges of the genus Contarinia (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) that infest the flower buds of various plant species have been newly found in Japan in recent years. Those infesting the flower buds of Pseuderanthemum laxiflorum (A. Gray) Hubbard ex Baillon (Amaranthaceae) and Jasminum sambac (Linnaeus) Aiton (Oleaceae) in Okinawa Prefecture, and Dendrobium spp. (Orchidaceae) in Mie Prefecture were identified, on the basis of morphological features and molecular information, as an invasive gall midge, C. maculipennis Felt. C. maculipennis was recorded in Mie Prefecture for the first time, and P. laxiflorum is newly regarded as one of the host plants of C. maculipennis. Three other Contarinia gall midges that we found infesting the flower buds of Lycopersicon esculentum Miller, Capsicum annuum Linnaeus (Solanaceae), and Oxalis corniculata Linnaeus (Oxalidaceae) were not identical with C. maculipennis. Among these, the first two, which infested solanaceous plants, were identical. However, the species other than C. maculipennis could not be identified to the species level because morphological differences were obscure and DNA sequencing data of allied congeners have not yet been registered on GenBank.
