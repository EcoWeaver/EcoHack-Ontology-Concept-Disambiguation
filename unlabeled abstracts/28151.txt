Do we need to jump in? A comparison of two survey methods of exotic ascidians on docks
Many ports and marinas contain exotic ascidians, ostensibly because they offer adequate physical habitat and harbour many boats or ships, which are considered important vectors of exotic ascidians. Standardized quantitative sampling of these habitats would be useful to assess exotic ascidian presence and abundance, as well as for more detailed ecological studies. In this paper two methods for sampling exotic ascidians are compared using data from nine marinas along the Olympic Peninsula and Upper Puget Sound, Washington, U.S.A. One method is considerably less expensive, drier and easier: it consists of laying a simple grid over the side of the floating dock from the surface, with species identity and abundance being measured on the spot. The other method involves swimming underneath marina floating docks, taking standardized digital photographs and analyzing the photographs later. Differences between these two methods might be expected because the environment sampled, the underneath versus the sides of floating docks, is slightly different, especially with respect to light. However, this study finds that both methods observed almost identical presence/absence patterns for exotic ascidians and, at least for the two most common exotics Botrylloides violaceus and Diplosoma listerianum, observed similar abundance trends across sites. Further analyses show that, while there are differences in the overall communities observed by the two methods, community patterns are correlated. Overall, this study finds that the easier surveys of the sides of floating docks are as effective for rapid assessment of exotic species presence/absence and relative abundance as those of the undersides of floating docks.
