Funding and Facilitation: implications of changing government policy for the future of voluntary Landcare groups in Western Australia
Landcare groups in Australia work to increase biodiversity, eliminate invasive species and promote sustainable land-use practices. With the implementation of the Rudd government's 'Caring for our Country' policy during 2008-09, financial and organisational resources available to these groups diminished. This paper examines whether the National Landcare Program's initial intentions--that agency support could be provided to 'kick-start' the community groups into action with the Landcare groups quickly becoming independent bodies--are ultimately realistic. The results show that the majority of Landcare groups continue to be reliant on government-sourced funding and Landcare facilitators, and that those groups which do not have access to support have reduced their activity levels accordingly. Landcare groups were suffering from a reduced volunteer base, with static or decreasing numbers of participants, an inability to set regular meetings and a lack of volunteers to take up leadership positions. The reliance of Landcare groups on government support suggests that Landcare was an unsuccessful form of state-sponsored community participation, making Landcare groups similar to other volunteer organisations in terms of their functional characteristics and reliance on externally sourced funds.
