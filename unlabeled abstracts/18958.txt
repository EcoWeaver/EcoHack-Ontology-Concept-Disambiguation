Phenotypic divergences induced by different residence time in invasive common ragweeds
Aims Possible shifts in the phenotypic performance along invasive plants' spreading route are rarely examined due to the discontinuous and incomplete records of exotic species. As the invasion history of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) is well documented in Hungary, its residence time is known for each location. By sampling a sequence of older to more recently established populations, we aimed to determine (i) whether there are phenotypic divergences along the historical spreading route of A.artemisiifolia; (ii) which traits are under selection during the invasion process and (iii) the extent of maternal effects on the individual's performance.
