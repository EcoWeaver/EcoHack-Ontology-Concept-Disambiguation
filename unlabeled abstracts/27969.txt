Diet overlap between native bigmouth sleepers (Gobiomorus dormitor) and introduced predatory fishes in a Puerto Rico reservoir
Bacheler NM, Neal JW, Noble RL. Diet overlap between native bigmouth sleepers (Gobiomorus dormitor) and introduced predatory fishes in a Puerto Rico reservoir. Ecology of Freshwater Fish 2004: 13: 111-118. (c) Blackwell Munksgaard, 2004 Abstract - Native fish species coexist with introduced species in Puerto Rico's freshwater systems, yet competition between these species has not been evaluated. We examined the extent of diet overlap between native bigmouth sleepers Gobiomorus dormitor and introduced largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and peacock bass Cichla ocellaris in a Puerto Rico reservoir. Bigmouth sleepers and largemouth bass exhibited an ontogenetic shift in feeding habits, whereas peacock bass were exclusively piscivorous at all sizes collected in this study. Biologically significant diet overlap was observed between large bigmouth sleepers and largemouth bass, but not between large bigmouth sleepers and peacock bass, or between large largemouth bass and adult peacock bass. No significant diet overlap in any species combination was observed in small or medium size classes. Better understanding of the ecology of these coexisting predators should lead to improved conservation of bigmouth sleepers, and improved fisheries management for all three predatory species.
