Spatiotemporal relationships between life stages of the invasive ctenophore, Mnemiopsis leidyi, and environmental parameters in the southern Caspian Sea
Spatiotemporal relationships between developmental stages (cydippid, transition and adult) of the comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi and environmental parameters were seasonally evaluated using the random forest (RF) model along the Iranian coasts of the Caspian Sea. The mean density of M. leidyi in spring, summer, autumn and winter were 8, 54, 130, and 15 ind m-3, respectively. The density of various stages, particularly cydippid, showed a decreasing trend with increase in depth. Cydippids had the highest abundance with a lower percentage in the deeper layers and colder seasons. Temperature was found to be the most influential parameter on the distribution of M. leidyi's life stages, particularly cydippids, with a stronger effect in spring and summer. The highest densities for all life stages were observed above 20 degC with an explosive growth at above 25 degC for the cydippids. Moreover, cydippids were strongly influenced by all the three stages of the copepod Acartia tonsa (nauplius, copepodite and adult), especially its later developmental stages. Due to the presence of M. leidyi, the maximum zooplankton abundance has shifted to cold seasons. There was also a relationship between M. leidyi with barnacle larvae and rotifers in the cold seasons. The interrelationships among the life stages of M. leidyi, particularly between the transition and cydippid, was a major factor in its population dynamics. The relationship curves between these environmental parameters and the life stages of M. leidyi were nonlinear and mostly sigmoidal (not absolutely linear). The magnitude of parameter importance and relationships curves varied with season and life stage.
