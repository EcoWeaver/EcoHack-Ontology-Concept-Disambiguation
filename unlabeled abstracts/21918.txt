Ovarian dynamics and oosorption in two species of predatory lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)
Abstract Ovarian development and oviposition dynamics of two species of lady beetle, Coccinella septempunctata L. and C. transversoguttata richardsoni Brown, are examined in laboratory experiments in which pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris) are provided ad libitum and then removed. Both species respond to prey removal by stabilizing at lower body weights, and by laying progressively fewer and smaller eggs of reduced viability, until oviposition ceases altogether after several days of starvation. Dissections of females after prey removal reveal similar patterns of oosorption in both species. However, C. septempunctata reduces oviposition more rapidly after prey removal than does C. transversoguttata. When prey are again provided, C. septempunctata soon lay as many eggs as previously but C. transversoguttata lay fewer. Females, especially of C. septempunctata, that stop producing and resorb eggs in the absence of prey lay more eggs subsequently than do females that feed continually on prey provided ad libitum and lay eggs throughout the experiment. Thus, although both species are responsive to a rapid change in prey availability, C. septempunctata appears to be especially responsive. Rapid responses to changes in prey availability may contribute to the greater abundance and reproductive success of this introduced species relative to the native C. transversoguttata in western North American alfalfa fields that exhibit widely varying pea aphid densities. However, both species engage in oosorption as a means of reserving resources under poor prey conditions and enhancing future reproductive effort when prey conditions improve.
