Introduction to Dynamic and Stochastic Resource Economics: Essays on Biodiversity, Invasive Species, Joint Systems, and Regulation
We begin by pointing out that the rise in popular concern about the judicious management of natural and environmental resources has been matched by increasing scholarship by economists on several issues concerning the efficient use and management of these same resources. Second, we note that this book's primary objective is to provide a representative account of where the literature in five specific areas of natural resource and environmental economics, presently stands. These five areas are natural resource management, biological diversity, ecological economics, invasive species management, and environmental regulation. Finally, following this introductory chapter, the 16 chapters of this book show how dynamic and stochastic modeling techniques can be effectively used to construct and analyze theoretical models that shed valuable light on salient research questions in the literature.
