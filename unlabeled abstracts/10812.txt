Risk assessment for large African hive beetles (Oplostomus spp.)--a review
We review the biology of two species of large African hive beetle Oplostomus haroldi and Oplostomus fuligineus (Coleoptera, Scarabideae, Cetoniinae). We argue that they have the potential to become invasive and highly damaging to beekeeping worldwide. We provide descriptions of all life stages that should aid in the identification of the beetles. Adult beetles prey on bee brood, whereas larvae and pupae live in dung. Up to 700 beetles have been reported in individual colonies in Kenya.
