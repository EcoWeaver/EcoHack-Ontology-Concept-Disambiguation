Invasive species induced food-web disruption, alternative regimes, and cyanobacteria dominance in a pelagic food web: a case history
An ordination approach using chemical and biological measures was employed to evaluate and identify alternative phases of a large, stratified, eutrophic lake as well as the correlated causes associated with them. The addition of a single exotic species, the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), resulted in a trophic cascade and major changes in the fish, phytoplankton, and zooplankton community that are still evident and continuing 36 years after the introduction. With this introduction, an alternative phase was evident by 1988 as the zooplankton community shifted to small crustaceans (mean length = 0.29 mm), phytoplankton biomass and turbidity increased, and initially cyanobacteria biomass decreased. Two decades after the introduction of the alewife, cyanobacteria have again become dominant in the system while phytoplankton biomass increased significantly, apparently due to long-term grazing of smaller crustaceans. Resiliency in the pelagic system was provided by the size-selective feeding of the alewife because it fed not only on zooplankton but also on the larval stages of the lake's top level predator, the walleye (Sander vitreus). In the past 15 years, phytoplankton abundance, phytoplankton biomass in all size ranges, and turbidity increased; transparency decreased to 2.2 m; and zooplankton, forage fish, and piscivore abundance collapsed. Whether the current conditions represent a new alternative phase, a prelude or tipping point before the collapse of the current ecosystem to a new alternate phase, or even a return to a previous state if the impact of the alewife population is effectively reduced, cannot be predicted with any precision with the current knowledge of ecosystem function.
