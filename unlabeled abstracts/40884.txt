Tree invasion within a pine/grassland ecotone: an approach with historic aerial photography and GIS modeling
In previous studies, evidence of tree invasion into grasslands has mainly been through comparison of historical terrestrial photographs and/or tree age data. The goal of this paper is to provide a quantitative description of the tree invasion process at a landscape scale using historical aerial photography, image processing and geographic information systems (GIS) approaches. Various map interpretive techniques provided evidence of shifts in the ponderosa pine-grassland ecotone along the Colorado Front Range since the late 1930s. Historical aerial photos were digitally scanned and the outlines of tree invasions into the grassland were determined based on gray tone density slicing. Image processing of digitized aerial photography identified areas of change in tree cover and quantified locations and total hectares of tree invasions into grassland areas. Overall, the results clearly show an increase in woodland areas where there formerly existed grasslands. GIS modeling was used to relate tree invasion patterns to topographic orientation and changes in settlement patterns. The importance of terrain aspect on rate of tree invasion is clearly shown by the greater rate of tree invasion on north-facing slopes (generally moister with less heat stress) versus south-facing slopes. The most dramatic change in the controls of vegetation patterns over the past one or two centuries has been the decline in fire frequency due to fire suppressing policy since ca. 1920. However, changes in grazing regimes may also have played an important role. When comparing these results to the instrumental climate record of the area, periods of favorable climatic conditions for seedling establishment generally correspond to periods of increased rate of tree invasion into grassland areas.
