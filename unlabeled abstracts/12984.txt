Developing indices of relative abundance for monitoring cave and ground weta (Orthoptera) in southern beech forest, New Zealand
We sampled populations of forest-floor dwelling cave and ground weta using footprint tracking tunnels and spotlight transect counts in southern beech forest, New Zealand. Samples were compared to estimates of weta density based on mark-recapture estimates from 25 m2 enclosures. Both activity indices captured variability in cave weta in time and space, were strongly correlated with each other, and have the potential for monitoring cave weta activity levels. Comparisons between indices and cave weta density estimates were equivocal, as recapture rates were too low to calculate high-resolution density estimates. We also found that cave weta counts had a curved relationship increasing with temperature, and a negative relationship with increasing shrub and woody debris cover. Based on these preliminary results, tracking tunnels could be a viable method of monitoring cave weta as they appear more efficient than transect counts and are relatively inexpensive. However, further calibration trials are needed to determine if indices mirror robust population density estimates.
