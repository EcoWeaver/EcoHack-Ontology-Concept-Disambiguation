Phylogeography of the bluespotted cornetfish, Fistularia commersonii : a predictor of bioinvasion success?
Biological invasions result in huge ecological and economic impacts; therefore, a great amount of effort is dedicated to predicting the potential success of newly established or candidate bioinvaders. Thus far, over 90 species of fish have entered the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez canal, the so-called Lessepsian bioinvaders. The bluespotted cornetfish, Fistularia commersonii, is remarkable in its ability to disperse within the Mediterranean and has been dubbed 'the Lessepsian sprinter'. In just a few years, starting in 2000, it expanded over the entire area, from the Suez Canal to Gibraltar. Theoretical predictions correlate the dispersal capabilities of an invader in its native range (using the population genetic metrics, Fst, as a proxy) with its dispersal capability in its invading area (continuous extent of spread, CES). Here, we estimated the population genetic characteristics of Indo-Pacific native populations of F. commersonii in order to determine if this Lessepsian 'sprinter' fits the predictive model of dispersal. Indeed, we found that even in the case of such a very rapid range expansion, the predicted relationship between Fst and CES is fulfilled in F. commersonii.
