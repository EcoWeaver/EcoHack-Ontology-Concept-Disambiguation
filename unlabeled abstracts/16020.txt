Ecophysiological responses and vulnerability to other pathologies in European chestnut coppices, heavily infested by the Asian chestnut gall wasp
Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu, the Asian chestnut gall wasp (ACGW), is an invasive alien species, which is causing alarm in the chestnut stands of Italy and Europe. It has extensively colonised the Castanea sativa Miller range throughout the country and highly conspicuous, alarming symptoms have appeared on plants. In addition, chestnut trees growing in Mediterranean climates are more frequently subjected to stressful environmental conditions, such as hot-dry periods or extreme weather events, which compromise both yield and productivity. It will be useful, therefore, to gain further insights into the biotic and abiotic disturbances affecting chestnut and their interactions in order to develop management strategies to counteract the loss of productivity.
