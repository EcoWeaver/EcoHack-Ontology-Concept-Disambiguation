Effect of irradiation on female painted apple moth Teia anartoides (Lep., Lymantriidae) sterility and attractiveness to males
  Live female painted apple moths are being used to monitor the distribution of this invasive species in Auckland as part of a major eradication effort, and the goal of this project was to develop a method to minimize the risk of unwanted live insect propagation from the trapping programme as a result of vandalism or 'eco-terrorism'. Female pupae were irradiated with a range of doses and their egg viability assessed, and also tested to determine the impact of irradiation on male moth catch in the field. Female painted apple moth pupae, irradiated at a range of doses from 100 to 500 Gy, were placed in cages in traps at 10 m spacings from non-irradiated females, near a central release site of irradiated males. Untreated control females alternated along orthogonal transects with irradiated females. The results indicated no significant effect of female irradiation on catch of males. There was no correlation between dose and catch, within the range of exposures tested. There was a very low hatch rate of eggs from females irradiated at all doses tested (100-500 Gy). These results suggest that irradiated females could be used in traps to reduce potential risks of deliberate spread of the unwanted organism by activists, without affecting the effectiveness of monitoring males.
