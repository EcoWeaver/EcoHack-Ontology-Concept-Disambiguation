The occurrence of invasive plant species differed significantly across three urban greenspace types of Metro Vancouver, Canada
Invasive plant species can impact conservation of biodiversity, cause human health problems, and be costly to control. Prevention is the most cost-effective management strategy, but to develop successful prevention strategies, managers and planners must understand why and where invasive plant species occur. Here, our objectives were to: (1) examine differences in the occurrence of invasive plant species (hereafter, species occurrence) among different greenspace types--park & recreation, natural areas, and leisure facilities--and (2) explore the relationships between species occurrence and socio-economic, topographic, and land use variables for these greenspace types. To do so, we used a logistic regression to model species occurrence. We found that natural areas had significantly higher odds of species occurrence than either park & recreation and leisure facilities. Greenspaces located within wealthier neighbourhoods and/or those with higher population density experienced higher odds of species occurrence. By identifying greenspace types at highest risk of invasive plant species establishment, these results help managers prioritize the allocation of funds and resources for invasive species management.
