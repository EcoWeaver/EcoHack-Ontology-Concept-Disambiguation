Road network density correlated with increased lightning fire incidence in the Canadian western boreal forest
This paper quantifies the influence of anthropogenic linear disturbances on fire ignition frequency in the boreal forests of western Canada. Specifically, we tested if linear features increase the frequency of lightning fires, and whether this relationship is affected by spatial resolution. We considered fires that ignited between 1995 and 2002 within a ~67 000 km2 region of boreal mixed-wood forest in north-eastern Alberta where linear features are highly abundant and spatially heterogeneous. We constructed Poisson, Negative Binomial and Zero-Inflated Poisson models at two spatial resolutions (~10 000 and ~2400 ha), including covariates for linear feature densities, forest composition, weather-lightning indices and geography. We found a positive association between lightning fire frequency and road density; this association was consistent at both spatial resolutions. We suggest this occurs owing to increased availability of flammable fine fuels near roads. The effect was attributable neither to increased detectability of fires proximal to roads by human observers, nor to increased lightning strikes due to metallic infrastructure alongside roads or the topographic characteristics of road location. Our results suggest that, in the face of projected road developments in the region, the potential exists for important changes to the regional fire regime. Further research should elucidate the precise mechanisms in order to develop methods for mitigation.
