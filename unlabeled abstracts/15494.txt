A risk based approach to non-native species management and biosecurity planning
The introduction of non-native species (NNS) is becoming an increasing problem across the globe. The need to identify and manage the pathways of their introduction has been identified as a priority for biosecurity management. There is a clear role for marine spatial planning to provide a multi-sector framework to assist in this management. A risk-based approach to identifying pathways and areas of introduction has been developed for the Shetland Islands (north Scotland), as part of the Shetland Islands' Marine Spatial Plan, Scotland. Working closely with local stakeholders was key to this process, which incorporates local and national data sets to form a high resolution model. It has been successfully used within the SIMSP and to guide the development of the Biosecurity Plan for the Shetland Islands. It also highlights the requirements for national and local legislation and policy to address and reduce all pathways within a region.
