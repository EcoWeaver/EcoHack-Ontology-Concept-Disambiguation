Interspecies transmission of Edwardsiella ictaluri in Brazilian catfish (Pseudoplatystoma corruscans) from exotic invasive fish species
Infections caused by Edwardsiella ictaluri are one of the biggest problems in the catfish industry in North America and have been reported in fishes around the world. E. ictaluri was detected in juvenile pintado Pseudoplatystoma corruscans--a Brazilian catfish--in a farm in Parana State, Brazil; diseased animals showed ascites and neurological signs of infection, with more than 50% mortality. Exotic invasive species susceptible to this bacterium have been reported in this area. We assessed the susceptibility of pintado to E. ictaluri with experimental infection via intraperitoneal and immersion methods as well as a cohabitation experiment with Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and African walking catfish Clarias gariepinus, 2 exotic invasive species. All pintados challenged by intraperitoneal and immersion routes and those cohabiting with infected C. gariepinus died within 17 d of the challenge. Mortality of Nile tilapia reached 71.42% after the intraperitoneal and 35.71% in the immersion challenges within 28 d, whereas African walking catfish showed zero mortality. Observed clinical signs were comparable to those in the farm and those described in the literature as enteric septicemia of catfish. With this study, we demonstrated the susceptibility of P. corruscans to E. ictaluri, as well as interspecies transmission of this bacterium.
