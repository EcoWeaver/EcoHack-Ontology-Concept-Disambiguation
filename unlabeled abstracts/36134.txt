A GIS Modeling Study of the Distribution of Viviparous Invasive Alien Fish Species in Eastern Europe in Terms of Global Climate Change, as Exemplified by Poecilia reticulata Peters, 1859 and Gambusia holbrooki Girarg, 1859
The potential distribution of tropical fish species in Eastern Europe--Gambusia holbrooki(introduced for biological control) andPoecilia reticulata(aquarium species, found in waste waters ofbig cities)--tend to be of particular interest in terms of global climate change. After GIS modeling ofour own data and findings listed in the GBIF databases (2278 points forG. holbrookiand 1410 pointsforP. reticulata) using the Maxent package and 'ntbox' package in R, 18 uncorrelated variables of35 Bioclim climatic parameters from CliMond dataset, it was found out that by 2090 guppies willappear in the south of Ukraine (Danube river's estuary, as well as in several places in the Caucasusand Turkey with habitat suitability > 0.3-0.5).G. holbrookiwill also slightly expand its range inEurope. Limiting factors forG. holbrookidistribution are: bio1 (Annual mean temperature, optimum+12-+24*C) and bio19 (Precipitation of coldest quarter (mm). Limiting factors forP. reticulataare:bio1 (optimum +14-+28*C), bio4 (Temperature seasonality), bio3 (Isothermality). UnlikeG. holbrooki,guppies prefer warmer waters. Such thermophilic fish species do not compete with the native ichthyofauna, but they can occupy niches in anthropogenically transformed habitats, playing an important role as agents of biological control.
