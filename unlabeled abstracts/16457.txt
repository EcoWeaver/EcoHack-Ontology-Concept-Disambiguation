Proximate composition and mineral and fatty acid profiles of male and female jinga shrimps (Metapenaeus affinis, H. Milne Edwards, 1837)
The jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis, H. Milne Edwards, 1837) is a commercially valuable alien decapod and a seafood product that is highly popular at seafood restaurants in Izmir (Turkey). The chemical, mineral, and fatty acid compositions of male and female jinga shrimps harvested in the Mediterranean Sea were determined for the first time. The compositions of both sexes confirmed that the jinga shrimp is a healthy food source due to its balance of nutrients, with efficient levels of protein and mineral contents. In fatty acid composition, the saturated fatty acid fraction was dominant, followed by polyunsaturated fatty acid and monounsaturated fatty acid. The atherogenic and thrombogenic index values were found to be higher in the jinga shrimp compared to other food sources, such as lamb, pork, or chicken.
