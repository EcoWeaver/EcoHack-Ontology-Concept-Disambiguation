Evaluating hybridization as a potential facilitator of successful cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica) invasion in Florida, USA
Interspecific hybridization is cited as one potential mechanism for increased invasiveness, particularly among some grass species. In the southeastern United States, the successful invasion of cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica) has sometimes been attributed to hybridization with the previously naturalized Imperata brasiliensis. This research aimed to determine whether genetic signals are consistent with these two species having experienced interspecific hybridization in Florida (USA), where it has been proposed that such an event facilitated cogongrass invasion across the region. Individuals of invasive I. cylindrica populations (n = 66) were sampled broadly from the state, and I. brasiliensis (n = 63) individuals were sampled from expertly identified and vouchered populations in Miami-Dade County. Genetic analysis utilized amplified fragment length polymorphisms in sampled individuals, and failed to detect significant genetic differentiation between the two species. Analysis of molecular variance partitioned the majority of detected variation within populations (86 %), while only 8 % was significantly partitioned between I. cylindrica and I. brasiliensis (FST = 0.135, P Imperata populations in South Florida that are currently considered to be I. brasiliensis are not genetically distinct from I. cylindrica, and regional cogongrass invasion likely was not facilitated by previously postulated interspecific hybridization.
