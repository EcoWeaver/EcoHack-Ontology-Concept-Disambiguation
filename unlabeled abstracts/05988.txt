An invasive foundation species enhances multifunctionality in a coastal ecosystem
Significance The accelerating loss of coastal foundation species impairs the delivery of vital ecosystem services on which nearly half the human population depends. Recognizing how loss of habitat-forming species such as seagrasses and oysters can be offset is therefore essential. This paper demonstrates that in areas where native foundation species are absent, nonnative habitat formers can amplify the production of diverse ecosystem functions that underpin provisioning of services to humans, such as food production. Our findings suggest that in areas where native foundation species have been lost, invasive habitat formers may be considered as a tool to enhance multiple ecosystem functions.
