Effects of mean intensity and temporal variability of disturbance on the invasion of Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea (Caulerpales) in rock pools
Disturbance is a key factor influencing the invasibility of habitats and assemblages. This relationship was extensively studied in terrestrial systems, but it was scarcely tested in the marine environment. We investigated experimentally the interactive effects of changes in the intensity and temporal variability of mechanical disturbance by boulders on invasion dynamics of the green alga Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea in littoral rock pools. We tested the hypothesis that the success of invasion of C. racemosa would be (1) greater under large than under low intensity of disturbance, (2) greater under large than under low temporal variability of disturbance and that (3) interactive effects could also occur, with variability of disturbance magnifying the effects of intensity. C. racemosa was virtually absent in pools maintained under high intensity of disturbance, independently of temporal variability. High intensity of disturbance was also associated with lower density and length of fronds and thinner diameter of the stolons of the alga. The total number of native taxa and the abundance of encrusting coralline algae increased under high intensity of disturbance. Differently, turf-forming algae were positively affected by temporal variability of disturbance, while canopy-forming algae did not respond to experimental treatments. Our results suggest a direct negative effect of the most severe experimental conditions on the spread of C. racemosa in rock pools. This likely overwhelmed likely concomitant positive and negative effects mediated by resident organisms. The results of this study help anticipating invasion dynamics of C. racemosa in rock pools under climate change scenarios, in which both intensity and temporal variability of extreme meteorological events are predicted to increase.
