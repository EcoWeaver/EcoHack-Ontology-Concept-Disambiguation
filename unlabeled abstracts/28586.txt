New data on alien species of parasites and hosts in the ecosystem of Lake Glubokoe (Moscow oblast, Russia)
Lake Glubokoe (Moscow oblast, Russia) is one of the most investigated water bodies of Europe. We detected new parasite species for the ecosystem of the lake (alien for territory of Europe): coccidian Goussia obstinata (in invasive alien fish Perccottus glenii) and copepod Neoergasilus japonicus (on aboriginal ruff Gymnocephalus cernuus). The given coccidian is host-specific for P. glenii and was introduced in the lake together with its host. Participation of P. glenii in circulation of recorded heteroxenous helminthes (Isthmiophora melis, Azygia lucii, and Raphidascaris acus) was revealed. This is confirmed by the data on trophic links of their obligatory definitive hosts (American mink Neovison vison and northern pike Esox lucius) with P. glenii in Lake Glubokoe.
