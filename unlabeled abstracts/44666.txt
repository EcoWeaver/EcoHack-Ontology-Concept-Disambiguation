Classification of communities with invasive species in the South Urals. II. Communities with a presence of genera Cyclachaena Fresen. and Xanthium L. species
This article is the second part of the series of publications on vegetation classification of communities with invasive species in the South Urals (Abramova, 2011). The communities with a presence of two aggressive species of North American origin such as Cyclachaena xanthiifolia (Nutt.) Fresen. and Xanthium albinum (Widd.) H. Scholz. are presented. Both species are included in "The black book of flora of the Central Russia" (Vinogradova et al., 2010). Research was conducted during 2000-2009 in the territory of Bashkortostan Republic. Species invasion in the region and their naturalization on flood plains of the South Urals was noted (Abramova, Anufriyev, 2008; Abramova, 2014; Abramova, Nurmiyeva, 2014). In the centers of invasion of mentioned species 110 complete geobotanical descriptions of communities on trial platforms of 4-100 m2 were executed. Classification of communities with the invasive species is carried out according to the Braun-Blanquet method with application of the deductive method (Kopecky, Hejny, 1974). The allocated syntaxa were compared to units earlier described in Bashkortostan Republic and other regions (Vegetace ..., 2009; Yamalov et al., 2012; etc.).
