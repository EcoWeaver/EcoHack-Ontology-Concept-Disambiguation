Activity of components of the antioxidant system in the roots of potato plants at short-term temperature drop and invasion with parasitic nematodes.
The activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase in the roots of susceptible plants and plants exposed to alternating temperatures, which were infected with the phytoparasitic nematode G. rostochiensis, was studied. It was found that, throughout the invasion period, the plants susceptible to invasion exhibited a high activity of these enzymes, which allowed them to maintain an active defense against the oxidative stress caused by the invasion and subsequent life activity of larvae. For the plants exposed to alternating temperatures, a decrease in the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase at the early stages of invasion and an increase in the activity of these enzymes at the later stages was detected.
