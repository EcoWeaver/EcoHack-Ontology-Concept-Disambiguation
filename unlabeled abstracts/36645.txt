Comparison of Multipiscivore Foraging Success on Native and Invasive Prey Fish under Variable Light Intensities
Piscivorous fishes attack and consume a variety of prey, however few studies have examined interactions of multiple predators with multiple prey species. The situational complexity of foraging at different times of the day was explored by examining the interactions of paired native predators (Burbot Lota lota or Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu) with either native (Mottled Sculpin Cottus bairdii) or invasive (Round Goby Neogobius melanostomus) benthic prey. The study allowed the comparison of a pursuit (Smallmouth Bass) and ambush (Burbot) predator. Trials were performed under natural relevant lighting conditions with downwelling light intensity and emission spectrum matched to the irradiance at 10-m depth found in the St. Louis River estuary during the summer at night, civil twilight, sunrise, and midmorning. Smallmouth Bass were more active and initiated 1,510 reactions that resulted in the successful capture of 61 Round Gobies and 103 Mottled Sculpins whereas Burbot initiated 475 reactions resulting in 24 successful retentions including 9 Round Gobies and 15 Mottled Sculpins. The percentage of successful retentions was greater for Smallmouth Bass at (10.9%) than for Burbot (5%). Reaction probabilities to each prey differed significantly which resulted in a two-fold increase in attacks on Mottled Sculpin compared with Round Goby within the same time period. Reaction distances for both predators did not differ regarding prey species, but Smallmouth Bass reacted father than Burbot (max. reaction distances of 159 and 98 cm, respectively). Greater success of native predators on native prey likely caused predators to expend more energy capturing invasive prey and caused higher mortality on native prey populations due to greater predator success.
