Effect of water column phosphorus reduction on competitive outcome and traits of Ludwigia grandiflora and L. peploides, invasive species in Europe
The invasion of alien macrophytes in aquatic ecosystems has caused serious ecological and economic impacts. Their introduction often leads to competition with natives and already established invasive species. Competition among invasive species is assumed to be greater than among native and invasive species, especially for plants with similar growth form and position in the water column. Many freshwater bodies are eutrophicated due to high phosphorus inputs, which have led to a competitive advantage for invasive macrophytes. A decrease in water column phosphorus load might lead to a change in competitive performance and reveal apparent variation in those traits promoting invasiveness. We investigated the effect of a water column phosphorus reduction on the growth, competitive outcome, traits and nutrient uptake of two related invasive Ludwigia species, L. grandiflora and L. peploides. We performed indoor competition experiments in eutrophic and mesotrophic conditions following a complete additive design. L. grandiflora always was the better competitor in both trophic conditions and had higher trait values compared to L. peploides. Both species relative growth rates (RGR) and trait values were affected by a P reduction, especially the number of branches and stem length. Although both species prefer higher water column phosphorus loadings, they can also colonize habitats of lower mesotrophic phosphorus concentrations. L. peploides was able to store more P in its tissue compared to L. grandiflora, thereby possibly outcompeting L. grandiflora in even lower P concentrations. Our results show a water column P reduction to lower branch numbers, stem length and biomass, which could reduce mat formation and allow for more effective control of both species.
