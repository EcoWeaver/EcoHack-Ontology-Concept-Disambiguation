Hybridization of Cyprinus carpio and Carassius auratus, the first two exotic species in the lower Laurentian Great Lakes
A preliminary comparison of Cyprinus carpio Carassius auratus hybrids with the parent species is made by means of hybrid indices for 29 morphometric and 19 meristic characters. Of these 48 characters 29 were intermediate, seven were identical with one of the parents and 12 were extreme. Marked osteological differences in the crania of the parent species were noted as possible diagnostic characters for the identification of hybrids.
