Isolation and characterization of polymorphic microsatellite loci for Imperata cylindrica, an invasive perennial grass
Cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica) is an invasive perennial grass widely distributed in the world, and two ecotypes (C-type and E-type) are found in Japan. We isolated and characterized eight microsatellite loci from the two ecotypes. The number of alleles ranged from 4 to 12 in C-type, 1 to 7 in E-type and 4 to 12 in the hybrid between them. The range of expected heterozygosities was 0.561-0.910 in C-type, 0.000-0.823 in E-type and 0.541-0.918 in the hybrid. These markers will be useful for investigating expansion process, natural hybridization between two ecotypes and reproductive strategy of this weed.
