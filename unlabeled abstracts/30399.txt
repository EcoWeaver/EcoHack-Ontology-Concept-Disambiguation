The saprobic and fruiting abilities of the exotic forest pathogen Heterobasidion irregulare may explain its invasiveness
The North American fungal pathogen Heterobasidion irregulare is invading and threatening pine stands in Italy and is freely hybridizing with the native species Heterobasidion annosum. Susceptibility of native hosts has been excluded as a factor driving H. irregulare invasion. Here we tested whether H. irregulare and H. annosum differ in their ability to saprobically colonize pine wood, and whether saprobic growth is correlated to fruiting bodies production. When inoculated in pine logs, H. irregulare genotypes colonized a volume of wood significantly larger than H. annosum genotypes. Heterobasidion irregulare significantly exceeded H. annosum in all parameters used as metrics of fruiting body production, including number and size of fruiting bodies, and pores perimeter index (PPI), an index summarizing the amount of surface available for spore production. Number of fruiting bodies and PPI were significantly correlated with volume of wood colonized by Heterobasidion genotypes. Results may explain why H. irregulare has been reported to sporulate more abundantly than H. annosum and provide explanations for its high transmission potential in Italy. This knowledge implies that approaches to control the spread of H. irregulare should be aimed at limiting saprobic establishment of the fungus rather than focusing on identifying more tolerant tree species.
