Introduced Macroalgae - a Growing Concern
Introductions of non-indigenous species to new ecosystems are one of the major threats to biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services. Globally, species introductions may lead to biotic homogenisation, in synergy with other anthropogenic disturbances such as climate change and coastal pollution. Successful marine introductions depend on (1) presence of a transport vector, uptake of propagules and journey survival of the species; (2) suitable environmental conditions in the receiving habitat; and (3) biological traits of the invader to facilitate establishment. Knowledge has improved of the distribution, biology and ecology of high profile seaweed invaders, e.g. Caulerpa taxifolia, Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides, Sargassum muticum, and Undaria pinnatifida. Limited, regional information is available for less conspicuous species. The mechanisms of seaweed introductions are little understood as research on introduced seaweeds has been mostly reactive, following discoveries of introductions. Sources of introductions mostly cannot be determined with certainty apart from those directly associated with aquaculture activities and few studies have addressed the sometimes serious ecological and economic impacts of seaweed introductions. Future research needs to elucidate the invasion process, interactions between invaders, and impacts of introductions to support prevention and management of seaweed introductions.
