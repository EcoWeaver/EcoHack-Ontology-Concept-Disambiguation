Introduction of the exotic tick Amblyomma hebraeum into Florida on a human host
A resident of Florida returned from a short visit to southern Africa to find a male Amblyomma hebraeum tick attached to the skin behind her knee. Amblyomma hebraeum is a major vector of 2 pathogens that cause important diseases in southern Africa, heartwater of ruminants and African tick-bite fever of humans. The tick was tested by polymerase chain reaction assay for evidence of infection with Cowdria ruminantium and Rickettsia africae (the causative agents of heart-water and African tick-bite fever, respectively) and was found to be negative for both agents. This is the second record of the exotic tick, A. hebraeum, being introduced into the United States on a human host.
