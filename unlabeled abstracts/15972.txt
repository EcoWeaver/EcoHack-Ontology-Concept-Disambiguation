Effects of flow on lateral interactions of fish and shrimps with off-channel habitats in a large river-floodplain system
Off-channel habitats play a crucial role in the life-cycles of many riverine fish species, but lateral movements of fish into these habitats are poorly understood. We tested how flow dynamics affects the movement of fish and shrimps between the main river channel and different types of off-channel habitats: a riverine lake and a wetland. Our study site was the lower Waikato River, North Island, New Zealand, where there are numerous off-channel habitats. Fish were sampled using directional fyke nets. Shortfin eel (Anguilla australis) migrated mostly into the wetland at night, particularly during high river flows. Common bullies (Gobiomorphus cotidianus) were most abun-dant during the day and in low-discharge conditions, moving mostly into the riverine lake, whereas fresh-water shrimp (Paratya curvirostris) moved mostly into the wetland. High numbers of non-native larval common carp (Cyprinus carpio) moved out of the wetland with retreating flood water. This study emphasises the importance of lateral connectivity and flooding in functioning of this river system where numerous native fish, but also exotic fish, used off-channel habitats. Floodplain management strategies should promote 'controlled connectivity' measures that provide access for native species at key times while limiting opportunities for introduced species to utilise their favoured off-channel habitats.
