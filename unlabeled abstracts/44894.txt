Genome Resources of Verticillium dahliae VdGL16: The Causal Agent of Vascular Wilt on the Invasive Species Ailanthus altissima
Verticillium species are known as plant pathogens responsible for wilt diseases in a large variety of dicotyledon plants and crops in many parts of the world. Here we present the draft genome sequence of Verticillium dahliae Kleb. (strain VdGL16) isolated in Italy from the invasive alien species Ailanthus altissima (Mill.; commonly known as tree-of-heaven) showing Verticillium wilt symptoms. The comparison between the newly sequenced genome with those publicly available revealed candidate genes putatively involved in pathogenicity. The genome represents a new useful source for future research on Verticillium genetics and biology as well as research on novel approaches in the control of A. altissima.
