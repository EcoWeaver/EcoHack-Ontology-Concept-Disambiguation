Detecting invasive species with a bio-inspired semi-supervised neurocomputing approach: the case of Lagocephalus sceleratus
The need to protect the environment and biodiversity and to safeguard public health require the development of timely and reliable methods for the identification of particularly dangerous invasive species, before they become regulators of ecosystems. These species appear to be morphologically similar, despite their strong biological differences, something that complicates their identification process. Additionally, the localization of the broader space of dispersion and the development of invasive species are considered to be of critical importance in the effort to take proper management measures. The aim of this research is to create an advanced computational intelligence system for the automatic recognition, of invasive or another unknown species. The identification is performed based on the analysis of environmental DNA by employing machine learning methods. More specifically, this research effort proposes a hybrid bio-inspired computational intelligence detection approach. It employs extreme learning machines combined with an evolving Izhikevich spiking neuron model for the automated identification of the invasive fish species "Lagocephalus sceleratus" extremely dangerous for human health.
