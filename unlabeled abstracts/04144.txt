Invasion history of Solenopsis invicta (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in Fujian, China based on mitochondrial DNA and its implications in development of a control strategy
One of the most invasive species worldwide, Solenopsis invicta Buren, has been described in China since 2003. Recent studies have suggested that China populations are the result of introductions from the USA; however, detailed molecular studies need to be performed in order to understand the expansion and potential multiple introductions from other countries into China. As there were populations of red imported fire ant, S. invicta in different areas and with different methods of introduction, mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene was used as a marker from 12 populations in four cities in Fujian Province, China, to determine the relationship of invasion among these populations. The three most common haplotypes previously describe in invasive populations of S. invicta: H5, H22 and H36, were found in Fujian. However, frequencies in each city were different. For instance, three populations from Longyan city which invaded with waste plastics, shared haplotype H5. Populations from Xiamen city and Jinjiang city which dispersed with nursery stock, sward and scrap leather, shared haplotype H22. The population from Nanyan village of Xinluo district, Longyan city, bore haplotype H36. Mitochondrial data reveals that the invasion history of S. invicta in Fujian Province is complex, including multiple invasions probably from other provinces within China. Security measures to prevent S. invicta spreading within China are as important as from overseas.
