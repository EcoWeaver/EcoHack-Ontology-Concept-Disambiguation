Microsatellite markers for an invasive tetraploid tree, Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera)
We present six polymorphic microsatellite loci for Chinese tallow tree (Triadica sebifera, Euphorbiaceae), which is native to East Asia and is an aggressive, invasive species in the southeastern USA, particularly along the Coastal Plain. Microsatellite loci were tested for polymorphism across a total of 79 individuals from populations across the native range of China and in introduced populations of the southeastern USA, California, Hawaii, and Australia. Across these samples, we found a high level of polymorphism, suggesting they will be useful for deducting the introduction history of this invasive species.
