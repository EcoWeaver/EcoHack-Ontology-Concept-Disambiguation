Effects of temperature on hardhead minnow (Mylopharodon conocephalus) blood-oxygen equilibria
Habitat perturbations, including dam construction with consequent temperature changes and the introduction of non-native species to California's mid- to low-elevation streams, have negatively influenced some native fish populations' historic distribution and abundance. Populations of hardhead, Mylopharodon conocephalus (Cyprinidae), have experienced such population declines, but environmental temperature effects on this large (to 60 cm SL), native species are poorly documented. We measured temperature effects on in vitro blood-oxygen affinity and equilibrium curve shape, key dynamics of the species' oxygen-transport system, derived from blood collected from wild-caught hardhead. Over an 11-30 degC temperature range, the half-saturation value (P50, an inverse measure of affinity) increased with the temperature from 0.51 to 1.80 kPa for low-PCO2 ("arterial") treatments and from 2.02 to 2.92 kPa for high-PCO2 ("venous") treatments. The apparent heat of oxygenation (temperature effect) was higher at temperatures > (absolute value) 19 degC. Therefore, hardhead's blood has a decreased ability to bind oxygen at its gills at temperatures >=25 degC, compared to that at temperatures <=19 degC. The hardhead's Bohr factors (F), non-bicarbonate buffer values (b), nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) concentrations, blood oxygen capacities (CBO2), and mildly sigmoid-shaped oxygen equilibrium curves showed no relationship with temperature. Overall, their blood-oxygen equilibria suggest that hardhead can tolerate moderate hypoxia and temperature variations in its environment and that they have some capacity for sustained, high-aerobic activity.
