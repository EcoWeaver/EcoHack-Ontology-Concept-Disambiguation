Megastigmus wasp damage to seeds of Schinus molle, Peruvian pepper tree, across a rainfall gradient in South Africa: implications for invasiveness
Recent studies have demonstrated that alien plant species have smaller pathogen and herbivore communities in their introduced ranges than in their native ranges (Mitchell & Power 2003), and that species regulated by predators in their native habitat may experience a strong predator release effect in their new environment (Maron & Vila 2001; Keane & Crawley 2002).
