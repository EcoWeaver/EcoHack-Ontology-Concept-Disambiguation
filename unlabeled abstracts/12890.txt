Introduced Western Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) reduce the emergence of aquatic insects in a desert spring
Introduced predators in donor food webs can disrupt the flow of prey to consumers in recipient food webs. We used mesocosms in a desert spring to investigate how an invasive fish predator, Western Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), affected the flux of aquatic insects to terrestrial food webs. We established monocultures and polycultures of Western Mosquitofish with 2 native species: Least Chub (Iotichthys phlegethontis) and Utah Chub (Gila atraria). We tested the hypotheses that introduced Western Mosquitofish would reduce the biomass of emerging aquatic insects more strongly than native fish, and that riparian spider density would decline in response to decreased emerging aquatic insects. Adult aquatic insects constituted 78 +- 2% of the flying insect community in this desert ecosystem, and Western Mosquitofish had a 2x greater negative effect on emergence than native fish. Compared to the fishless control, Western Mosquitofish reduced the total emergence biomass of aquatic insects by 62 +- 8%, Callibaetis americanus by 90 +- 4%, and chironomids by 34 +- 4%. Neither native fish reduced the emergence of chironomids, but both reduced the emergence of C. americanus (Utah Chub: 85 +- 3%, Least Chub: 78 +- 3%), and Utah Chub significantly reduced total emergence by 41 +- 5% compared to the fishless control. Also, a pattern of delayed emergence of midges in fish treatments compared to the fishless control suggested a potentially important nonlethal effect of fish on the flow of energy from desert springs to terrestrial consumers.
