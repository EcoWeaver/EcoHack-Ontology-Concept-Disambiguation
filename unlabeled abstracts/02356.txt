A NEW ALIEN CRAB IN EUROPE: HEMIGRAPSUS SANGUINEUS (DECAPODA: BRACHYURA: GRAPSIDAE)
The Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus is recorded for the first time in two European localities, Le Havre in France and the former estuary "Oosterschelde" in the Netherlands. While breeding populations occur in the former, only two male specimens were found in the latter. In both places, this alien species was mixed with the common shore crab Carcinus maenas.
