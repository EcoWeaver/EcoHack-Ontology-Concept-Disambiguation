AbstractPaukova Z.: Invasive plant species in the three microregions of Nitra region, south-west Slovakia. Ekologia (Bratislava), Vol. 32, No. 2, p. 262-266, 2013. Alien plant species were recorded by field survey in three selected microregions (submontane in district Zlate Moravce, hilly in district Nitra and lowland in districts Nove Zamky) in Nitra region, SW Slovakia in 2011. In the microregions totally 19 invasive neophytes were recorded. The most frequent and abundant species were the following: Ailanthus altissima, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Conyza canadensis, Fallopia x bohemica, Helianthus tuberosus, Iva xanthiifolia, Negundo aceroides, Robinia pseudoacacia, Solidago canadensis and Stenactis annua. On the basis of the data we can preliminary conclude that the number of species and the number of localities in the southern lowland microregion were almost twice higher than those in the northern hilly region.
