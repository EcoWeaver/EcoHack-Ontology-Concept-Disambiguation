Restoration Within Protected Areas: When and How to Intervene to Manage Plant Invasions?
Despite the on-going efforts to set aside land for conservation, biodiversity is increasingly being threatened by factors such as invasive alien species that do not recognise these boundaries. Invasive species management programmes are widely incorporated into protected area management plans; however, the success of these programmes hinges on the ability to identify when a system will be able to recover after invader control and eradication efforts and when further intervention will be necessary to aide recovery. Invasive alien plants can alter ecosystem attributes to produce strong legacy effects that prevent the recovery of a system. Here we provide a framework for how to identify and incorporate recovery constraints into restoration efforts. Identifying recovery constraints can help improve how ecological theory - assembly rules, ecological succession, and threshold dynamics - can be used to guide restoration efforts.
