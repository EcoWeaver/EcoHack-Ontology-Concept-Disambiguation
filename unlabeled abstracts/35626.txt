Alien Species of Invertebrates and Fish in River Ecosystems of Belarus: Distribution, Biological Contamination, and Impact
The concept of biological contamination of aquatic ecosystems and methods of its assessment are considered in the paper. Data on the distribution, main pathways and vectors of invasion, and also the influence of global factors on the processes of invasion are discussed. The effects registered as a result of invasion of alien species of invertebrates and fish into river ecosystems of Belarus have been analyzed. It has been shown that the main factors responsible for this process include hydrotechnical construction in Ukraine, navigation, and natural distribution of species. The examples of an adverse effect of invasive species on aboriginal species and communities are also given.
