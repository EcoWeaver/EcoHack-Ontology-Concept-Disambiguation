Shrub Invasion of a Southern New Mexico Desert Grassland Range
The grazing value of a large portion of the desert grassland in southwestern United States has been greatly reduced during the last 100 to 150 years by the in-vasion of undesirable shrubs. Al-though much of the present area is now lightly infested, infesta-tion does not have to be heavy before range productivity is seri-ously damaged. As the economic welfare of the Southwest de-pends in large measure upon its grazing and soil resources, in-vestigations to determine the extent of shrub invasion, rate of range deterioration, and possible reasons for this retrogression in plant cover are important. In this study, records of vegeta-tional changes, environmental conditions, and forage utilization were compiled and analyzed in an attempt to determine the ex-tent of shrub invasion on a south-ern New Mexico semidesert grassland range over a thirty-year period.
