Effect of spreading of invasive thorny acacia (Acacia nilotica) in Bekol Savanna of Baluran National Park to savanna area and composition of javan bull feed (Bos javanicus)
Abstract Acacia nilotica was introduced to Baluran National Park in 1969 for forest fire prevention. Nowadays, A. nilotica becomes invasive species due to their fast-growing and rapid spreading species types. Bekol Savanna in Baluran National Park has been affected by the changing of grass composition of javan bull's feed. Bekol Savanna has 12 species of grass as javan bull's feed and dominated by Brachiria reptans as it almost covers 60% of the savanna area. GIS method was applied to estimate the area of Bekol Savanna that changed by the spreading of invasive A. nilotica by the year 2002, 2007, 2013, 2017 and 2018, through satellite imagery analysis and concentration count method to estimating javan bull population. The result shows that javan bull's feed grass composition and changing of Bekol Savanna have an impact on javan bull population in Baluran National Park. The estimated population of Javan bull in 2003 was 81 and constantly decreased and remain 17 in year of 2017.
