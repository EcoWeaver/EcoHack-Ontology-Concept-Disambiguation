Climate warming mediates range shift of two differentially adapted stenothermal Drosophila species in the Western Himalayas
The average temperature of the earth has increased from 0.3 to 0.6 degC, and warming is facilitating faunal reshuffling. Variable thermal environments warrant mechanisms to adjust the expression of phenotypic values to environmental needs. Ectothermic Drosophilids are profoundly affected by thermal selection (i.e., genetic effects) or through induced effects on phenotypes (i.e., plastic effects). Climatic data for the last fifty years involves a significant change in average temperature (Tave) of Western Himalayas, which has affected the distribution and boundaries of various Drosophilids in this region. There is a significant decline in the number of D. nepalensis from lower ranges; whereas D. ananassae is reported to be introduced to lower to mid mountainous ranges. Further, a comparison of fecundity, hatchability, and viability at different growth temperatures has shown significant decrease in trait values at 17 degC in D. ananassae and at 25 degC in D. nepalensis. Thus, the recent range changes of these two species involve genetic effects on ecophysiological and plastic effects on life history traits. Our results indicate that thermal plasticity of life history traits can be species-specific; thus climate change may lead to a mismatch of such traits to the changing environment. We suggest that D. nepalensis and D. ananassae could serve as indicator species for analyzing range changes under changing climatic conditions. Evolutionary biologists can provide unique perspective to the examination of how climate change will affect the earth's biota.
