Structure of plant-Hymenoptera networks in two coastal shrub sites in Mexico
The study of interaction networks between plants and pollinators allows us to explore interaction patterns at the community level, detect changes in visit frequency and evaluate the nestedness of the networks. The latter allows rare plant species to be visited by more abundant species of pollinators, potentially allowing community diversity to be maintained, and this approach makes it possible to discern the rewiring (changes in connections) of species when their preferred resource is not available. In this study, the topology, species identity and rewiring were compared between two contrasting sites, one within a conservation area and the other subjected to continuous disturbance. The networks of both sites were significantly nested and shared a high number of common species of both plants and pollinators. However, the sites differed notably in the number of exclusive interactions, suggesting a high percentage of interaction rewiring. The introduced bee species, Apis mellifera, was the most frequent species at both sites and also the most connected in terms of the number of its interactions. This is explained by its generalist foraging characteristics that allow it to form part of the networks' core group. In general, our results underscore the importance of knowing the identity of the participating species when studying networks, and how connections change between them, as well as the potential effect of habitat destruction and the role of invasive species in the rearrangement of the interactions; all factors that can exert an influence on the functioning of plant-pollinator networks.
