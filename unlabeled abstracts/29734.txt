Alien mollusks within the territory of Ukraine: Sources and directions of invasions
The main directions of expansion of alien mollusks in Ukraine are revealed. Expansions of both exotic species and nearby aliens ones are observed. The Danube, Dnieper, and line of water bodies of the Azov-Black Sea region's seaside are important invasion corridors to the inland waters. The urbanization and reduction of zoogeographical barriers are the basic driving processes in expansion of alien terrestrial snails. Invasions into marine ecosystems are related to transfer of distant exotic species by sea navigation and homogenization of fauna in the East Mediterranean Basin ("pontization" and "mediterranization")
