Introduction, establishment and spread of the Southern mouthbrooder Pseudocrenilabrus philander in the Baakens River, Eastern Cape, South Africa
This paper provides evidence for the extralimital establishment and spread of Pseudocrenilabrus philander in the Baakens River, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Since the first occurrence record at a single locality in 1994 this species has now spread throughout the river and the population contains both reproductive adults and juveniles. Gut content analysis demonstrated potential dietary overlap with native fishes and predation on fish larvae. Pseudocrenilabrus philander in the Baakens River therefore satisfies all criteria for an invasive species in this river and was categorised as invasive using a unified framework for biological invasions.
