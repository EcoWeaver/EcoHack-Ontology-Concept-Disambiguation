Can the Geranium Bronze, Cacyreus marshalli, become a threat for European biodiversity?
Cacyreus marshalli Butler is an invasive species in many parts of Europe and Mediterranean area. In Europe, its larvae normally feed on pelargoniums. We investigated its potential to spread to native Geranium spp. and evaluated the conservation risks that such a shift would pose for both native geraniums and cohabitant butterflies. The host plant preferences of the Geranium Bronze were investigated under controlled conditions. Studies included both no-choice and multi-choice tests, respectively using 9 and 6 Italian native Geranium spp. Host plant preferences were evaluated by counting the number of eggs laid on individual plants and following butterfly development until adult emergence. Under no-choice conditions, at least one egg was recorded on each tested plant, except for G. phaeum L. All the plants on which oviposition occurred were fully suitable for larval development. The butterfly, however, clearly preferred three species, i.e. G. pratense L., G. sanguineum L. and G. sylvaticum L. for oviposition. In multi-choice trials, females laid at least one egg on all the tested plants, with a preference for G. pratense and G. sylvaticum. In presence of Pelargonium spp. plants, however, no oviposition was observed on any Geranium spp. We assessed offspring fitness measuring their wingspan. No statistical differences were detected in the wingspan between adults emerged from Geranium and Pelargonium. Cacyreus marshalli represents a potential threat for both native geraniums and for Geranium-consuming lycaenids, such as Aricia nicias Meigen and Eumedonia eumedon Esper.
