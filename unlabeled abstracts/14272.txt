The precautionary approach to non-native fisheries--The case of striped bass in Texas
Fisheries managers have long relied on non-native fish to improve, sustain, or create recreational fishing opportunities, often without adequate consideration of potentially negative ecological consequences. There is growing advocacy for using the precautionary approach to avoid potentially serious or irreversible harm to the environment in the face of scientific uncertainty. This paper uses striped bass (Morone saxitilis) in Texas to examine possible effects that might have resulted had the precautionary approach been applied before stocking began in the 1960s when the species was considered non-native to Texas. The current range of reproducing striped bass populations extends from the North Atlantic Ocean to the U.S.-Mexico border. However, the western extent of the species current range beyond Louisiana is probably the result of stocking begun in 1965 that continues today. The historic range is yet unresolved. The best available information suggests that striped bass are not native to Texas, fish stocking has resulted in beneficial economic impacts, and any negative effects (i.e., harm) are currently unknown. It seems unlikely that application of the precautionary approach would have led to different outcomes in Texas than currently exist. However, the complete striped bass story has yet to be written.
