More is not necessarily better: the interaction between insect population density and culture age of fungus on the control of invasive weed water hyacinth
The possibilities of a positive or negative impact the biocontrol agents may have on each other as well as on the control of the weed itself, inspired us to study the interactions between the mirid, Eccritotarsus catarinensis and the phytopathogen, Acremonium zonatum, biocontrol agents of water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes. Observations were made on disease initiation time of A. zonatum grown for different time durations with different insect densities on water hyacinth. In absence of mirids, the lowest (3.1 days) and the highest (5.1 days) disease initiation time was observed using 21 and 42 days old culture respectively. In treatments involving mirids, the shortest (1.78 days) and the longest (13.22 days) disease initiation time by A. zonatum was observed on water hyacinth with 10 and 20 mirids/plant respectively. By the 30th day, maximum percentage damage (77.9%) was observed in the treatment of 21 day old fungal culture with 20 mirid density/plant despite of initial delay in disease initiation. This result suggests an initial development of a plant defense response due to mirid feeding delaying the pathogen from establishing. Extensive studies involving multitrophic interactions should be an essential part of pre-release assessments to enhance the success rates of biological control of weeds.
