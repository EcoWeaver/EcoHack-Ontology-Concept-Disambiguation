First record of an introduced population of the southern lineage of white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius 'italicus') north of the Alps
Elucidating the status of populations of endangered species of unclear origin may have important implications for conservation management. In September 2013, a population of white-clawed crayfish was discovered outside of the native range in a small artificial lake in the River Neckar catchment in southwestern Germany. White-clawed crayfish comprise two distinct lineages of yet unresolved taxonomic status, of which only the western lineage (Austropotamobius pallipes s. str.) is native to Germany. To clarify the taxonomic identity and origin of the newly discovered population, we evaluated diagnostic morphological characters and sequences of two mitochondrial genes (for 16S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) from two crayfish specimens. Both analyses concordantly assigned the crayfish to the southern lineage (A. 'italicus'), with the closest matching haplotypes originating from northwestern Italy, southeastern Switzerland, and Lake Plansee in Austria, where an abundant introduced population of this lineage is present. The artificial lake in Germany was reportedly stocked with freshwater mussels from this Austrian lake. It thus appears likely that A. 'italicus' was introduced intentionally or accidentally during the process. Austropotamobius 'italicus' does not naturally occur north of the Alps and thus represents a non-native taxon for Germany, a fact to be considered in its management.
