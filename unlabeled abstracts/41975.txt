Fire and Invasive Species Management in Hot Deserts: Resources, Strategies, Tactics, and Response
The 'Wildfire and Invasive Plants in American Deserts' conference highlighted key issues related to the combined threat of invasive species and wildfire in hot deserts through a workshop comprising a number of presentations. The Chihuahuan, Mojave, and Sonoran deserts of the American Southwest share common species such as creosote bush and native bunch grasses that are negatively impacted by wildfires driven by invasive species. Covering nearly 250,000 square miles, the Chihuahuan Desert is the largest of the North American deserts. The Mojave Desert occupies a significant portion of southeastern California and smaller parts of southern Nevada, northwestern Arizona, and extreme southwestern Utah. The Sonoran Desert is a region covering 120,000 square miles in southwestern Arizona and southeastern California, as well as most of Baja California del Norte, the islands of the Gulf of California, and the western half of Sonora, Mexico.
