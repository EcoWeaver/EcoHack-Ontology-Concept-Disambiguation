Phloeocharis subtilissima Mannerheim (Staphylinidae: Phloeocharinae) and Cephennium gallicum Ganglbauer (Scydmaenidae) new to North America: a case study in the introduction of exotic Coleoptera to the port of Halifax, with new records of other species
Phloeocharis subtilissima Mannerheim (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Phloeocharinae), a Palearctic staphylinid, and Cephennium gallicum Ganglbauer (Coleoptera: Scydmaenidae: Cephenniini) are recorded for the first time for North America from Point Pleasant Park, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The bionomics of both species are discussed based on European data in addition to new observations of their ecology in Nova Scotia. The role of port cities, such as Halifax, in relation to the introduction of exotic Coleoptera is discussed with examples of other species introduced to North America from this location. The earliest known record of Meligethes viridescens (Fabricius) for North America and the second and third reported locations of Dromius fenestratus Fabricius are also presented.
