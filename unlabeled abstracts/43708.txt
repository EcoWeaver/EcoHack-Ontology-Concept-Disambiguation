Introducing the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species: challenges with classification
The Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) presents annotated country checklists of introduced and invasive species. Annotations include higher taxonomy of the species, synonyms, environment/system in which the species occurs, and its biological status in that country. Invasiveness is classified by evidenced impact in that country. Draft country checklists are subjected to a process of validation and verification by networks of country experts. Challenges encountered across the world include confusion with alien/invasive species terminology, classification of the 'invasive' status of an alien species and issues with taxonomic synonyms.
