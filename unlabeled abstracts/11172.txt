Non-native fish species in Hungarian waters: historical overview, potential sources and recent trends in their distribution
Due to its central position in the Danube basin and its considerable fishery sector, Hungary plays a key role in the spread of non-native fish species in Europe. Nevertheless, the status of non-native fish has not yet been reviewed for Hungary. Therefore, our aims were (1) to give a comprehensive historical overview regarding the occurrence of non-native fish species of Hungary, (2) to show their recent distribution patterns using GIS, and (3) to evaluate the importance of the possible drivers in their spread. Literature data show 59 non-native fish species from Hungary. The appearance of new species--mostly due to aquarium fish releases--shows an accelerating trend nowadays. Although non-native fish have appeared at 78.7% of the studied 767 sites during our recent countrywide survey, their distribution was uneven. Lowland streams, lowland rivers, and the River Danube were the most affected by non-native fish, particularly the gibel carp, topmouth gudgeon and pumpkinseed escaped from fish/angling ponds, and the recent invasion of Ponto-Caspian gobies. Our results indicated that in order to reduce the effects and intensity of further invasions, more rigorous control of aquarium trade, angling pond stockings, and inter-watershed fish transports are necessary. full text available: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10750-017-3147-x
