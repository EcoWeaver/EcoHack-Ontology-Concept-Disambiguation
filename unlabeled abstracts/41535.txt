Biology of an Introduced Ambrosia Beetle, Xylosandrus compactus,1 in Florida2
Xylosandrus compactus (Eichhoff), an introduced ambrosia beetle, is established in at least 28 counties in Florida and has been reported from southeast Georgia. The fungal symbiont was identified as Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc. The chaetal pattern of the head capsule is described. Average duration of the egg, larval, pupal, and adult maturation stages at room temperature was 5, 7.5, 7.5, and 8.5 days, respectively. Thirty-one plant species served as hosts of X. compactus in Florida. On flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.) X. compactus overwintered principally as adults in twigs and small branches, began emergence during late February, began attacks on new twigs during March, and began producing brood during April. Highest population levels in flowering dogwood twigs occurred from June through September.
