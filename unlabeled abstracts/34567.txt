Structural and cytochemical investigation of the leaf of silverleaf nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium), a drought-resistant alien weed of the Greek flora
Light and scanning electron microscopy as well as histochemical reactions were employed to investigate the leaf structure and secretory activity of an adventive perennial pest that is rapidly dispersing in the Mediterranean region. Interesting structural characteristics, not common among the well-adapted native Mediterranean phanerophytes, were observed. Although 'unconventional', these structural characteristics produce an ecologically equivalent, xeromorphic leaf on a plant that proves to be competitive and very efficient under the Mediterranean climatic conditions.
