Sex-Dependent Cold Tolerance at the Northern Invasive Range Limit of Gambusia affinis on Cape Cod, Massachusetts
Many invasive species may be constrained in their ability to invade high latitude or elevation habitats due to limits of cold tolerance. However, isolated populations at the edge of these species' geographic ranges may face a combination of strong selection and lack of maladaptive gene flow that allows them to adapt to the cold and invade further. Here we show that an isolated population of Gambusia affinis (on Cape Cod, MA, USA), one of the most invasive fish in the world, can survive temperatures lower than any reported tolerances for other populations, with large, long-lived females showing more tolerance than males. Indeed, male acute cold tolerance appears insufficient, suggesting the population may persist through winters mainly via the ability of mated females to delay offspring production until spring. This combination of female cold tolerance and life history may open the door for further expansion of this invasive species into high latitude freshwater habitats.
