Potential of invasive shrubs for energy applications in Uganda
In this study, six fast-growing invasive biomass species; Acacia mearnsii, Broussonetia papyrifera, Lantana camara, Mimosa pigra, Psidium guajava and Senna spectabilis were studied to determine their potential for fuel and biofuel production. Proximate composition, ultimate composition and heating values were determined using standard methods. The thermal analysis, chemical interactions, and morphology were studied using Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis respectively. Aspen Plus Version 11 was used to simulate slow, fast and flash pyrolysis of the biomass. Senna spectabilis had the highest heating value of 17.84 MJ/kg and the lowest ash content, making it the most suitable for thermochemical conversion. Based on the compositional analysis, Senna spectabilis also had the highest content of cellulose (48%), making it most suitable for biofuel production via enzyme saccharification. The Aspen Plus model for the pyrolysis process was used to predict the yields and products of pyrolysis of the biomass species for typical reactor conditions and feedstock composition. The highest yield of biogas, biochar and bio-oil was achieved at 650 degC for all the biomass species. Moreover, Lantana camara was the most suitable for biogas production and Senna spectabilis for biochar and bio-oil production. The influence of the pyrolysis temperature on the pyrolysis products, flue gases and gaseous emissions was also demonstrated in this study.
