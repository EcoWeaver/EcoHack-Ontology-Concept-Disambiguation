Biological invasion by Thespesia populnea in sites under fluviomarine influence
The present study aimed to report the biological invasion by Thespesia populnea of sites under fluviomarine influence and adjacent environments of the Sergipe River, in Aracaju, Sergipe, Northeastern Brazil, by Thespesia populnea, as well as to evaluate the susceptibility of the occurrence of the species in other Brazilian regions. The study site comprises a mangrove area and adjacent sites of the Sergipe river. The focuses of the invasion by T. populnea were obtained by means of walks throughout the extension of the site (active search). To evaluate the susceptibility of occurrence of the species in Brazil, an ecological niche modeling analysis was performed. The invasion of the species was registered at several points in the study area, with the highest concentrations in the most degraded sites. The results of the model analysis demonstrate high to extremely high susceptibility to the occurrence (biological invasion) of the species in several parts of the country. The attributes of the species, observations in situ and results of the modeling analysis suggest the need to control T. populnea in the study area and prohibition of its planting in the Brazilian territory. Keywords: exotic invasive, modeling analysis, mangrove.
