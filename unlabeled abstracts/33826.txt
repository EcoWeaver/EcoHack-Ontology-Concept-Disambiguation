Proteomic Analysis of Potato Responding to the Invasion of Ralstonia solanacearum UW551 and Its Type III Secretion System Mutant
The infection of potato with Ralstonia solanacearum UW551 gives rise to bacterial wilt disease via colonization of roots. The type III secretion system (T3SS) is a determinant factor for the pathogenicity of R. solanacearum. To fully understand perturbations in potato by R. solanacearum type III effectors(T3Es), we used proteomics to measure differences in potato root protein abundance after inoculation with R. solanacearum UW551 and the T3SS mutant (UW551^HrcV). We identified 21 differentially accumulated proteins. Compared with inoculation with UW551^HrcV, 10 proteins showed significantly lower abundance in potato roots after inoculation with UW551, indicating that those proteins were significantly downregulated by T3Es during the invasion. To identify their functions in immunity, we silenced those genes in Nicotiana benthamiana and tested the resistance of the silenced plants to the pathogen. Results showed that miraculin, HBP2, and TOM20 contribute to immunity to R. solanacearum. In contrast, PP1 contributes to susceptibility. Notably, none of four downregulated proteins (HBP2, PP1, HSP22, and TOM20) were downregulated at the transcriptional level, suggesting that they were significantly downregulated at the posttranscriptional level. We further coexpressed those four proteins with 33 core T3Es. To our surprise, multiple effectors were able to significantly decrease the studied protein abundances. In conclusion, our data showed that T3Es of R. solanacearum could subvert potato root immune-related proteins in a redundant manner. [Formula: see text] Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).
