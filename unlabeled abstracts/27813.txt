Certification Issues for Some Common Aquaculture Species
There is interest in certification of aquaculture production facilities in response to concerns about negative environmental and social impacts and food safety. This study identifies issues to be considered by stakeholders in developing certification standards for channel catfish, tilapias, rainbow trout, oysters, mussels, clams, scallops, abalone, and seaweed. Common issues include land and water use, water pollution, benthic effects, effects on biodiversity, use of antibiotics and other chemicals, and relationships with workers and local communities. Specific, contentious issues apply to individual species or species groups. Fish meal use in feeds will be a major concern in finfish certification. Use of groundwater, removal of daily mortalities, and medicated feed in channel catfish culture should be given particular attention. Tilapia culture can introduce these species into watersheds where they have not previously occurred, resulting in serious competition with native species. Some environmentalists and consumers object to hormone treatment of tilapia to produce all male fry. Widespread use of therapeutic agents in trout culture will be a major concern. Discussions of shellfish certification should focus on water use conflicts and public health risks associated with the consumption of these organisms. The introduction of non-native species and genetic alterations with respect to oysters also will need to be addressed. Further, introduction of non-native species should be a major topic in discussions of abalone and seaweed culture. The source of wild seaweed to use as food in abalone culture also will be an issue.
