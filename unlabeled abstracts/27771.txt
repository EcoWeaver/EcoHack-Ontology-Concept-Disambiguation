Liriomyza sativae(Diptera: Agromyzidae), an invasive species in South-East Asia: Studies on its biology in northern Vietnam
Leafminter of the genus Liriomyza are important pests of agricultural crops. In the mid-1990s three polyphagous new world species have been accidently introduced into South-East Asia. Different aspects of the biology of one species, Liriomyza sativae Blanchard, were studied during the period May 2000 - July 2001 in Hanoi province in northern Vietnam on longbean, soybean, tomato, potato and cucumber. Trapping of adults and counting of larvae in mines showed that in May - June the generation time was approximately 15 days. This was supported by laboratory studies at constant temperature. The generation time was about 25 - 30 days in October - November and about 20 days in the spring season (February - May), based on adult trapping. In an unsprayed field, more than 50% of all mines contained parasitized larvae about 2 months after transplanting. Use of insecticides had little effect, indicating resistance in the leafminers.
