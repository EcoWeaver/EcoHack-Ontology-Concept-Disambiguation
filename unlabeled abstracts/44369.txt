CRISPR Contributes to Adhesion, Invasion, and Biofilm Formation in Streptococcus agalactiae by Repressing Capsular Polysaccharide Production
The clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) system functions classically as a prokaryotic defense system against invading mobile genetic elements, such as phages, plasmids, and viruses. Our previous study revealed that CRISPR deletion caused increased transcription of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) synthesis-related genes and severely attenuated virulence in the hypervirulent piscine Streptococcus agalactiae strain GD201008-001. Here, we found that CRISPR deficiency resulted in reduced adhesion, invasion, and biofilm formation abilities in this strain by upregulating the production of CPS. However, enhanced CPS production was not responsible for the attenuated phenotype of the DCRISPR mutant. RNA degradation assays indicated that inhibited transcription of the cps operon by CRISPR RNA (crRNA) was not due to the base pairing of the crRNA with the cps mRNA but to the repression of the promoter activity of cpsA, which is a putative transcriptional regulator of the capsule locus. IMPORTANCE Beyond protection from invading nucleic acids, CRISPR-Cas systems have been shown to have an important role in regulating bacterial endogenous genes. In this study, we demonstrate that crRNA inhibits the transcription of the cps operon by repressing the activity of promoter PcpsA, leading to increases in the abilities of adhesion, invasion, and biofilm formation in S. agalactiae. This study highlights the regulatory role of crRNA in bacterial physiology and provides a new explanation for the mechanism of crRNA-mediated endogenous gene regulation in S. agalactiae.
