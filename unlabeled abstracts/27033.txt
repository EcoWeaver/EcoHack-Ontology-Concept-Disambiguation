Changes in Different Trophic Levels of Litter-dwelling Macrofauna Associated with Giant Knotweed Invasion
The highly invasive giant knotweed (Reynoutria spp.) often displaces nettle (Urtica dioica) dominated stands in European floodplains. Urtica-dominated stands differ from the monospecific Reynoutria stands in plant species richness and stand structure. We thus hypothesize that Reynoutria invasion profoundly alters ecosystem structure and function, with negative effects cascading up through the food chain. We performed a paired sampling design in six sites belonging to two different locations and studied effects on the soil and the litter-dwelling fauna. Reynoutria stands differed in habitat structure and were characterized by decreased soil pH and potassium depletion. The faunal analysis is based on model groups of herbivore generalists (Gastropoda), detritivores (Isopoda and Diplopoda), and predators (Opiliones). The gastropod assemblages from Reynoutria stands were severely impoverished subsets of those from Urtica stands with reduced densities, species richness and diversity. In general, snails were more sensitive to Reynoutria invasion than slugs such as the invasive Arion 'lusitanicus'. Among detritivores, the abundance of the Isopoda decreased, whereas Diplopoda were not affected by Reynoutria invasion. Yet, the relative abundance of detritivores was significantly higher within the Reynoutria stands. Abundance, species richness and diversity of the predatory Opiliones were higher in the relatively sparse Reynoutria stands. We conclude that ecosystem changes associated with Reynoutria invasion are characterized by shifts from a plant-based to a detritus-based food chain and that Reynoutria invasion primarily enhances predators that profit from the simplified vegetation structure.
