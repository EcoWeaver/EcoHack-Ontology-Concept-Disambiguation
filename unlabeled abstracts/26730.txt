Variations in parasitism in sympatric populations of three invasive leaf miners
  Parasitism was investigated in sympatric populations of three invasive gracillariid leaf miners in Europe, Cameraria ohridella, Phyllonorycter robiniella and Phyllonorycter platani to test the hypotheses that C. ohridella is less heavily parasitized by native parasitoids and attacked by fewer species than the two other invasive species. In all regions investigated, C. ohridella showed a lower parasitism rate, and its parasitoid complex was poorer in species than those of either Phyllonorycter spp. Comparisons were made between sympatric populations of C. ohridella on its main host tree, Aesculus hippocastanum, and an occasional host, Acer pseudoplatanus. Parasitism rates were similarly low and composed of the same parasitoid species on both trees. In contrast, a sympatric population of Phyllonorycter geniculella, a native species mining A. pseudoplatanus, was heavily parasitized by a totally different parasitoid complex. These results suggest that the low parasitism in C. ohridella by native polyphagous leaf miner parasitoids is due neither to its host tree, nor to a problem of synchronization between the phenology of the pest and that of its parasitoids. Instead, it probably results from the inability of the native parasitoids to locate, attack, or develop on a new host that does not have any native congener in Europe.
