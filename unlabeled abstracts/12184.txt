The other sides of invasive alien plants of India--With special reference to medicinal values
Invasive Alien Species (IAS) have been emerging as the second biggest threat to global biodiversity after habitat destruction. They intervene in environmental services offered by ecosystems and negatively impact flood control, water supply, water assimilation, nutrient recycling, conservation and regeneration of soils. Due to these threats better IAS management is needed for a biodiversity rich nation like India. To date very few examples of successful eradications of IAS exist. However, some studies have pointed out several economic benefits rendered by IAS which include fodder, food, manure, bio-fuels and medication values which make them interesting from a commercial point of view which could led to an increase in demand for these IAS species by certain industries (pharmaceutical, botanical sectors) in the future driving IAS to the verge of extinction in the wild this way. This review presents an overview of IAS existing in India and their possible medicinal potential which could, if proven useful, lead to an alternative way of controlling the proliferation of IAS and to conserve nature diversity.
