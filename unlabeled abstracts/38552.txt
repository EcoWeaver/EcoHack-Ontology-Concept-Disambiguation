The River Odra Estuary as a Gateway for Alien Species Immigration to the Baltic Sea Basin
The river Odra estuary belongs to those water bodies in the Baltic Sea area which are most exposed to immigration of alien species. Non-indigenous species that have appeared in the Szczecin Lagoon (i.a. Dreissena polymorpha, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Corophium curvispinum) and in the Pomeranian Bay (Cordylophora caspia, Mya arenaria, Balanus improvisus, Acartia tonsa) in historical time and which now are dominant components of animal communities there as well as other and less abundant (or less common) alien species in the estuary (e.g. Branchiura sowerbyi, Eriocheir sinensis, Orconectes limosus) are presented. In addition, other newcomers - Marenzelleria viridis, Gammarus tigrinus, and Pontogammarus robustoides - found in the estuary in the recent ten years are described. The significance of the sea and inland water transport in the region for introduction of non-indigenous species is discussed against the background of the distribution pattern of these recently introduced polychaete and gammarid species.
