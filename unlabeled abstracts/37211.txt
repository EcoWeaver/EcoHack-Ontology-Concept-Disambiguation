An overview of the translocated native and non-native fish species in Croatia: pathways, impacts and management
Fish introductions and/or translocations, particularly in areas with high biodiversity and endemism, represent a major threat to biodiversity. Fish translocations between the Danube and the Adriatic basins in Croatia have not been well documented, and the origin, pathway or reason for translocation for many species is still not clear. A total of 33 fish species, both native and non-native, were translocated from the Danube to the Adriatic basin, while one non-native species was translocated from the Adriatic to the Danube basin. The first known translocations date back to the 18th century, when pike Esox lucius and tench Tinca tinca were translocated to Vrana Lake on Cres Island. The largest numbers of translocations were made for recreational and sport fishing activities, or unintentionally. Most translocated species have become naturalized in their new habitats. The recommendation is to reinforce control measures to prevent translocations and to implement enhanced conservation measures for native fish in their native habitat, particularly for the Adriatic region. http://www.reabic.net/journals/mbi/2017/ICAIS.aspx
