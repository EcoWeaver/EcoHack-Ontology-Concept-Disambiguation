Description of Sidneioides peregrinus sp. nov. (Tunicata: Ascidiacea: Polyclinidae): a possible exotic species in the Atlantic Ocean
Several colonies of Sidneioides Kesteven, 1909 were collected on the underside of boulders in Paranagua Bay during recent surveys (early 2010). Sidneioides is in the Polyclinidae because it has gonads and the heart in the posterior abdomen, which is also a vegetative stolon (KOTT 1992). The main apomorphy for this genus is the ovary in the middle of the right side of the thorax and not in the posterior abdomen, where it is found in the other genera (KOTT 1992). Sidneioides comprised only three species until now: S. japonense Redikorzev, 1913 and S. snamoti (Oka, 1927), both from Japan, and the type species of the genus, S. tamaramae Kesteven, 1909, from Tamara Bay, Australia. PERES (1957) described a putative fourth species, S. ivicense, from the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean Sea), in a coralline bank about 60-70 m depth. However, the specimens studied by PERES (1957) were immature and were considered Sidneioides based only on the lack of the dorsal atrial languet, after HARANT (1929), who believed this character to be diagnostic for the genus. Today, however, we know that these three species all have a dorsal atrial languet, even the type species S. tamaramae (KOTT 1985). Addi-tionally, A.A. RAMOS-ESPLA (unpub. data) has extensively surveyed the region in the 1980s and did not find this species again. Herein we describe Sidneioides peregrinus sp. nov. which is the first re-port of a species of this genus in the Atlantic Ocean.
