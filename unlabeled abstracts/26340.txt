Is the exotic bumblebee Bombus terrestris really invading Tasmanian native vegetation?
There has been a great deal of disagreement surrounding the capacity of Bombus terrestris to invade Tasmanian native vegetation. This paper reviews the conflicting findings of previous surveys of the invasion of Tasmania by B. terrestris, and presents new data from the 2004-2005 austral summer. From this, it is clear that B. terrestris has extensively invaded Tasmanian native vegetation. The new data provide strong evidence that B. terrestris is breeding in native vegetation in every region of Tasmania. More than 10 bumblebees were seen in one day at 153 locations in native vegetation, including 42 locations within 10 National Parks and 38 locations within the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. Nests of B. terrestris were also found within two National Parks. These findings suggest that B. terrestris would also invade native vegetation in non-arid temperate regions of the Australian mainland, if it is introduced there.
