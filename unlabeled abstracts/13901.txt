Chemical composition rather than plant geographic origin drives the breakdown of riparian plant litter with changes in associated invertebrate diversity
Background and aims The study aimed to assess the effects of the potential replacement of dominant native plants by co-occurring exotic invasives on organic matter degradation in a riparian area. The questions were: i) Is there a relationship between the litter breakdown rate and species origin? ii) Is the chemical composition more relevant than species origin? iii) Does species origin influence the associated saprophagous invertebrate community? Methods Within the riparian zone of the Garonne River (France), we conducted a litterbag experiment using pairs of native and exotic species selected in the stages of the successional gradient. Results Native and exotic species did not differ in their primary chemical composition and breakdown rate. Litter breakdown rates were primarily driven by the C:N ratio with no influence of species origin. The abundance and diversity of saprophagous invertebrates of exotic and native species did not differ, but the composition did. Only one plant litter was completely degraded much earlier than expected (next litterfall) while remnant litter were still present at this time for the other species. Conclusions The replacement of a dominant native by an exotic invasive plant species does not generally result in noticeable changes in the litter breakdown rate, which mainly depends on litter composition. Litter from quickly degrading exotic species may cause a resource discontinuity in invaded areas stabilized by river regulation.
