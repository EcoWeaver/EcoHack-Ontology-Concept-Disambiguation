Life history traits of the exotic freshwater snail Melanoides tuberculata Muller, 1774 (Gastropoda, Thiaridae), and its sensitivity to common stressors in freshwaters
Abstract: Aim In the present study has analyzed several aspects of the life history traits of Melanoides tuberculata, an exotic species, under laboratory conditions, and its response to some stressors has also been applied. Methods Sensitivity to two toxic substances was tested. The mollusks were collected and cultured in the laboratory under controlled conditions of temperature of 25 +- 1 degC and ad libitum food regime. Growth rates and biomass were experimentally obtained and the individual growth curve obtained. Results The experiment lasted 287 days and the maximum shell lengths registered was 11.67 mm. The growth curve indicated a rate of 3.98 year-1 and a maximum theoretical length of 10.61 mm. The mean post-embrionary development time until first reproduction was 275 days and the size of the primipara was 10.13 mm. An accelerated growth of juveniles was observed with fast increase in the shell length until sexual maturity, but growth rate decreased afterwards as more energy was devoted to reproduction. Under the combination of 25 degC and fed on alternate days, M. tuberculata had a slow growth and a long-life expectancy under laboratory conditions. The tolerance of this mollusk to temperature as a stressor ranged between 16 degC and 37 degC, being the optimum temperature situated between 29 degC and 34 degC. The LC(I)50-24h for reference substances were: 0.70 g L-1 for KCl and 9.05 g L-1 for NaCl. Conclusion Based on these results, we can conclude that M. tuberculata is a species tolerant to temperature and salinity, what partially explains to accordance to its wide and rapid dispersion throughout tropical waters.
