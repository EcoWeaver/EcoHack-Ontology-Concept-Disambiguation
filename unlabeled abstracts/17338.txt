Improving decisions for invasive species management: reformulation and extensions of the Panetta-Lawes eradication graph
Effective decisions for managing invasive species depend on feedback about the progress of eradication efforts. Panetta & Lawes (2007) developed the eradograph, an intuitive graphical tool that summarizes the temporal trajectories of delimitation and extirpation to support decision-making. We correct and extend the tool, which was affected by incompatibilities in the units used to measure these features that made the axes impossible to interpret biologically. Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. Panetta and Lawes' approach represented delimitation with estimates of the changes in the area known to be infested and extirpation with changes in the mean time since the last detection. We retain the original structure but propose different metrics that improve biological interpretability. We illustrate the methods with a hypothetical example and real examples of invasion and treatment of branched broomrape (Orobanche ramosa L.) and the guava rust complex (Puccinia psidii (Winter 1884)) in Australia. These examples illustrate the potential of the tool to guide decisions about the effectiveness of search and control activities. The eradograph is a graphical data summary tool that provides insight into the progress of eradication. Our correction and extension of the tool make it easier to interpret and provide managers with better decision support.
