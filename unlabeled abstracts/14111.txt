Checklist of tidepool fishes from Jericoacoara National Park, southwestern Atlantic, with additional ecological information
Ichthyofauna from 29 tidepools in Jericoacoara National Park (Ceara State, Brazil) was sampled. A total of 733 fishes, comprising 16 species belonging to 12 families, was collected. The three most abundant species were the frillfin goby Bathygobius soporator, the sergeant-majorAbudefduf saxatilis and the molly miller Scartella cristata. An invasive species from the Indo-Pacific, the Muzzled blenny Omobranchus punctatus, was also recorded. The known geographic distribution of the blenny Hypleurochilus fissicornis was extended approximately 2,500 km northward. These findings highlight the lack of knowledge of the rocky intertidal ecosystems along the Brazilian coast, an area that needs more sampling effort and ecological data.
