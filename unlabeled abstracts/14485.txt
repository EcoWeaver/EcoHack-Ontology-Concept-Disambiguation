The rapid invasion of spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae), in Hungary
The invasive spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae), native to South-East Asia, is a recent threat for fruit production of temperate zones worldwide. The fly was detected in 2008 for the first time in Europe (Italy and Spain) and four years later, in 2012, it was found in Hungary at a highway rest area. In this study, the results of a countrywide survey of D. suzukii in Hungarian highway rest areas in 2012-2014 are summarized and supplementary trapping results are also represented for three cities. In 2012 and 2013 the species was found only in low numbers and in a few sites in the western part of the country, while in 2014 an outbreak of D. suzukii populations was detected. Adult flies were found at most of the trapping sites all over the country. Additionally, they were also present in the three monitored cities. Our results show that D. suzukii has practically settled in the whole country in 2014.
