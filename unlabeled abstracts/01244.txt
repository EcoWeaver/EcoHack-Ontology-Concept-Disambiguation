Targeted gene flow for conservation
Anthropogenic threats often impose strong selection on affected populations, causing rapid evolutionary responses. Unfortunately, these adaptive responses are rarely harnessed for conservation. Here, we suggest that conservation managers should pay close attention to adaptive processes and geographic variation, with an eye to using them for conservation goals. Translocating pre-adapted individuals into recipient populations is currently considered a potentially important management tool in the face of climate change. Here we point out that targeted gene flow could have much broader application in conservation, with uses ranging from the management of invasive species and their impacts to controlling the impact and virulence of pathogens.
