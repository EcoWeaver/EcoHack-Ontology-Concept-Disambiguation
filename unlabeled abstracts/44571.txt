new alien species in the flora of Bosnia and Herzegovina.-Thaiszia-J. Bot. 31 (1): 081-086. Abstract: Physalis philadelphica Lam. native to Mexico is now widely grown for its edible fruits ('tomatillo'). It has been recorded as a new alien species to the vascular flora of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, P. philadelphica is reported from only one locality near the town of Zavidovici in Central Bosnia in September 2020. The specimens were growing along the banks of the Krivaja River in the vicinity of the village Ribnica. Brief information on the species distribution in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a short morphological description are given, as well as a key to Physalis species occurring in the Balkans.
