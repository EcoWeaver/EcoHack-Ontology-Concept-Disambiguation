Priorities for the Control and Management of Alien Invasive Plants on Islands
Alien invasive plants are high on the list of environmental factors negatively impacting on indigenous biota, particularly those of islands. Effective management of these plants is essential for conservation and restoration of native habitats and species. This process is currently focussed on preventing alien species reaching an island and controlling those alien species that have become invasive. It is recommended that there should also be an emphasis on identifying potentially invasive species from among those alien species already present on an island. This necessitates a biological recording programme for alien species, the optimal characteristics of which are described in some detail. The alien species found should then be profiled against existing autecological knowledge and other relevant characteristics. An assessment process needs to be established to identify high-risk alien species, i.e. target species, which merit a proactive response leading to eradication. Consideration is given to mechanisms that could be used to identify target species and determine how action could be implemented.
