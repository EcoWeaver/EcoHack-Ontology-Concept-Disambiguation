The Chemical Composition of the Lionfish (Pterois miles, Bennett 1828), the New Invasive Species of the Mediterranean Sea
In this study, the proximate composition of muscle tissue was investigated in lion fish (P. miles), which has a high invasion potency in the Mediterranean. At the same time, the potentials of accumulation of essential and toxic metals in brain, gill, muscle and liver tissues have been examined. The study was carried out with 4 lion fish individuals (1st individual 278 g, 28 cm, 2nd individual 55 g, 19 cm, 3rd individual 68 g, 20 cm, 4th individual 92 g, 22 cm) caught from the Yesilovacik Bay in 2016. Water, crude protein, total lipid, total mineral substance (TMS) percentages were found to be 75.68-77.62%, 20.05-21.08%, 1.11-1.84%, 1.22-1.54 in P. miles, respectively. The percentage of fatty acids in lionfish ranged from 34.26% to 37.57% saturated fatty acids (SFAs), from 24.99% to 27.99 % monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and from 20.49% to 49.31% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Dominant fatty acids are palmitic acid and stearic acid from SFAs, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, cetoleic acid from MUFAs, EPA and DHA from PUFAs. The accumulation levels of heavy metals in the tissues were found as Fe> Zn> As> Cu> Cr> Pb, respectively. The accumulation levels of each metal in the tissues were determined as follows: liver>gill>brain>muscle (29.19-384.43 mg g -1 dw) for Fe, gill>brain>liver>muscle (16.08-56.68 mg g -1 dw) for Zn, muscle>brain>gill>liver (2.69-7.88 mg g - 1 dw) for As, liver> brain>gill>muscle (0.74-7.05 mg g-1 dw) for Cu, brain>gill>muscle>liver (0.35-2.67 mg g -1 dw) for Cr, brain>gill>muscle>liver (0.26-2.11 mg g -1 dw) for Pb. As a result; while lionfish muscle tissue contains high levels of protein, unsaturated fatty acids, minerals and trace elements, it has been determined that levels of heavy metals in this consumable tissue are not at levels that could threaten human health.
