Physiological comparison of alien Senecio inaequidens and S. pterophorus and native S. malacitanus: Implications for invasion
Drought is common in Mediterranean-type climates. Water stress can have serious physiological consequences for plant fitness. Here we analysed the response of two alien invasive species, Senecio inaequidens DC. and S. pterophorus DC., and one native non-invasive, Senecio malacitanus Huter, in terms of photosynthesis, water relations and growth. The proportional reduction in growth as a result of water stress was smaller in S. malacitanus, followed by S. inaequidens and finally S. pterophorus. Variations in relative growth rate were related to differences in unit leaf rates, which are strongly correlated with photosynthesis. At a similar level of leaf relative water content (RWC), photosynthesis in S. inaequidens and S. malacitanus did not differ, whereas it was lower in S. pterophorus. S. malacitanus started to show a reduction in RWC later than the other species. The hypothesis that alien invaders have greater physiological tolerance to drought than native non-invaders is not supported by our results since S. malacitanus showed a more adaptive response to drought than the aliens and was also the most resistant of the three species to water shortage. Differences in invasiveness would therefore be explained by a combination of traits, including establishment capacity, competitive capacity and drought resistance, among others.
