Genetic structure ofLycorma delicatula(Hemiptera: Fulgoridae) populations in Korea: implication for invasion processes in heterogeneous landscapes
AbstractLycorma delicatula(White) was identified in 2004 as an invasive pest in South Korea, where it causes serious damage to vineyard crops. To investigate the population structure and dispersal pattern ofL. delicatulain South Korea, we estimated the population genetic structure and gene flow among nine locations across the country using seven microsatellite markers. AlthoughL. delicatulaspread throughout most of its geographical range in South Korea within 5-7 years following invasion, its populations show evidence of genetic structuring across the range with a low but significant globalFST(genetic differentiation across all populations) of 0.0474. Bayesian-based clustering analysis indicates the presence of at least three genetically unique populations in South Korea, including populations in northeastern South Korea, which show a distinct genetic background. However, isolation by distance suggests that populations in South Korea have not yet reached genetic equilibrium. Estimates of the historical rate of gene flow (Nem) indicate that relatively high rates of flow have been maintained among populations within the western region, which may indicate recent range expansion. A population assignment test using the first-generation migrant detection method suggested that long-distance dispersal ofL. delicatulamay have occurred over large areas of South Korea. More complex dispersal patterns may have occurred duringL. delicatulainvasion of heterogeneous landscapes in South Korea.
