Review on studies ofEupatorium adenophoruman important invasive species in China
Eupatorium adenophorum Spreng. was introduced in Yunnan Province of China around 1940. Since then it has been spreading rapidly, particularly in the southern and southwestern parts of China and caused serious economic loss. The biological research and integrated control onE. adenophorum were carried out from 1980's in Yunnan Province. Together with other 15 invasive external species, the weed has been listed in the White Paper by The State Environmental Protection Administration of China. This paper briefly reviews the studies on natural distribution, biological character, ecological character, chemical component, hazard, potential application and the control ofE. adenophorum. The research direction for this invasive external species in future was also discussed.
