Diurnal patterns of photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, and PRI to evaluate water stress in the invasive species, Elaeagnus umbellata Thunb
Photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, and hyperspectral reflectance were used to evaluate diurnal changes of Elaeagnus umbellata to quantify physiological responses of the invasive species during times of stress. Field measurements showed that E. umbellata is able to maintain higher levels of photosynthesis relative to nearby Quercus alba plants, with less water loss. Plants subjected to progressive drought were able to recover photosynthesis one day following re-watering. Laboratory and field measurements revealed decreasing DF/F'm values in response to drought stress, with little corresponding decrease in photochemical reflectance index values. This research supports the view that xanthophyll cycle dissipation is not the photoprotective mechanism at work for Elaeagnus species under water stress. Elaeagnus umbellata maintains photosynthetic carbon assimilation even under drought conditions, in part, due to chemical dissipation of excess light, and in part because of morphological features that limit excess radiation while maximizing photosynthetic carbon gain. These characteristics may contribute to the invasive success of E. umbellata. Keywords Elaeagnus -PRI-Fluorescence-Photosynthesis-Chlorophyll-Drought stress
