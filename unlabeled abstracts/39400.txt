The distribution of the invasive pest, rice water weevil Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is expanding in Europe: First record in the Balkans, confirmed by CO1 DNA barcoding
This is the first report of the invasive rice pest, rice water weevil (Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel) in the Balkans. Adult specimens were collected in the rice field region of Central Macedonia, Greece during July-August, 2016. Morphological identification was verified by DNA barcoding, and the first COI sequence of L. oryzophilus from Greece was deposited in the GenBank database. This semi-aquatic insect is considered one of the most important rice pests globally, and its presence in the region may result in important yield and economic losses in rice production. Considering the highly invasive nature of this species, it is possible that it has spread to neighboring rice wetlands of the Southern Balkans, and additional field investigations are essential to accurately determine its geographic distribution and to help contain its spread.
