Ecological impacts on aquatic macroinvertebrates following upland stream invasion by a ponded pasture grass (Glyceria maxima) in southern Australia
Glyceria maxima (Reed sweet-grass), an emergent aquatic grass native to Eurasia, has naturalised in North America, New Zealand and southern Australia. Introduced as a ponded pasture species, it threatens native biodiversity and ecosystem processes in freshwater wetlands and waterways. We compared paired sections, either invaded or not invaded by G. maxima, of three upland streams in Gippsland, Victoria, Australia to infer its impacts on macroinvertebrate abundance, morphospecies density, and morphospecies and functional feeding group (FFG) composition. Its potential effects in altering sedimentation were explored by comparing stream channel morphology in paired stream sections at one site. Invasion by G. maxima appears to drive changes in macroinvertebrate morphospecies composition and FFG composition, reducing a diverse array of macroinvertebrates to a more uniform fauna. The estimated volume of plant/sediment matrix in a 50 m invaded stream section was around 1100 m 3, nearly 15-fold greater than in an adjacent uninvaded stream section. Glyceria maxima is an autogenic ecosystem engineer, with the ability to convert sections of fast-flowing aerobic streams into partially anaerobic swamps. By generating a root-mat swamp with a high capacity to process nutrients, G. maxima may facilitate its own growth and spread, as well as that of secondary invaders.
