Biological invasions and ecological hypotheses
At the time of an enormous inflation of edited volumes on biological invasions (many of them claiming their uniqueness), this is clearly an outstanding book. It is exceptional for two reasons. First, it deals with both ancient (nine studies) and modern (nine studies) migrations and/or invasions of plants and animals to, or from, Australasia (mostly Australia). Second, each study is consistently built around a set of 11 central hypotheses from population and community ecology: H1 - a species will not be able to invade an area that has abiotic conditions that are outside its physiological tolerance levels; H2 - the extent of an invasion is negatively correlated with the species diversity of functional guild competitors in the invaded environment; H3 - an invasive species will not be able to replace a native species if they occupy the same niche and are in all other ways equal; H4 - a species will not be able to invade an area that harbors pathogens (that cause disease) or predators (that prey on the invading species) that it has not encountered before (the opposite of this hypothesis is stated as the Enemy Release Hypothesis); H5 - a species will not be able to invade an area if its coevolutionary species (necessary for parts of the invader's life cycle) is/are not present in the area; H6 - species that occur at low population densities in their native range will not be invasive; H7 - a species will not be able to invade an area if it has a lower use efficiency of its limiting resource than a native species that occupies the same location; H8 - species can more easily invade highly disturbed areas; H9 - species from older lineages are more vulnerable to being replaced by invasive species that occupy a similar niche; H10 - a species will be able to invade an area only if it has a life-history strategy that is more r selected than that of the species that is already occupying the niche; and H11 - there are no rules concerning whether a species is invasive or not, it all happens by chance.
