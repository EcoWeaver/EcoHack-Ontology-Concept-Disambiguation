Boldness and dispersal tendency of native and invasive pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus): is spatial sorting creating superior invaders?
The ability of non-native species to establish populations, expand their range, and ultimately affect native species is influenced by the behaviour and dispersal potential of individuals. Spatial sorting theory predicts that individuals with greater dispersal tendencies will accumulate at the invasion front and promote further territorial expansion. The theory predicts that the reproduction of such individuals at the front as a result of their proximity leads to selection for better dispersers. To test for evidence of this phenomenon in successful invasive populations, we compared boldness and dispersal tendency in one native North American and two invasive European populations of pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) reared in a common environment, with a second wild native population from a local water body added to the comparison. Tests were conducted in a 4-metre long artificial flume with a video capture system recording movement. Boldness was measured using the time it took an individual to emerge from a sheltered area, and dispersal tendency was assessed using a combination of movement metrics as the fish explored the flume. Contrary to expectations, native North American populations were bolder than invasive European populations, and there was no significant difference in dispersal tendency between native and invasive pumpkinseed. Females were bolder and showed greater dispersal tendency than males. Post-hoc analysis indicates that populations originating from lotic water bodies had significantly lower dispersal tendency than those from lentic water bodies regardless of native/invasive status, suggesting that habitat of origin may affect dispersal tendency.
