Membraniporopsis tubigera, an invasive bryozoan in sandy beaches of southern Brazil and Uruguay
The massive irruption of the invasive bryozoan Membraniporopsis tubigera (Osburn) in sandy beaches of southern Brazil and Uruguay is reported. The species, originally described from Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida, has also been recorded for Brazilian beaches from 21degS to 26degS as well as for harbours of Australia, New Zealand and the Sea of Japan. The southward spreading rate of this bryozoan along the Brazilian and Uruguayan coasts can be estimated in approximately 183-195kmyear-1. The chances that this invasion could proceed southwards in the Southwest Atlantic and the possible impacts that it may be causing are discussed. The case of M. tubigera seems to be qualitatively and quantitatively different from those of other alien bryozoans previously recorded for this region, since it appeared massively in exposed sandy beaches, a habitat regarded to date as apparently free from the pervasive ecological impact of invasion by exotic species in the Southwest Atlantic.
