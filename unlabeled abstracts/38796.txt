Occurrence of invasive insects on woody plants in the main green areas from Bucharest city
In the current context of globalization, biological invasion of alien species has an important impact on environment, economics or human health. Particularly, the spread of these species in urban green areas, is problematic due to several reasons. The aim of this research was to report the presence of invasive insects on woody plants in the main parks across Bucharest (namely Alexandru Ioan Cuza Park, Bucharest Botanical Garden, Cismigiu Gardens, King Michael I Park, USAMV Campus, Youth Park).
