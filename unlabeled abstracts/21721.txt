Rearing of Paraglenea fortunei (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) Larvae on Artificial Diets
Larvae of Paraglenea fortunei were reared on two artificial diets. Diet A consisted mainly of casein, and Diet B was composed primarily of a commercial artificial diet for herbivorous insects. First instar larvae were reared at a constant temperature of 25degC and a photoperiodic regime of a 16-hour photophase and an 8-hour scotophase for 120-129 days, followed by exposure to low temperatures to induce pupation. Some larvae developed into adults prior to the change in temperature, whereas others developed after treatment. The percentages of adults that developed from larvae reared on diets A and B were 31.1% and 31.1%, respectively.
