The presence of Chaetozone corona (Polychaeta: Cirratulidae) in the Mediterranean Sea: an alien or a native species?
The re-examination of specimens previously reported as Chaetozone setosa or Chaetozone sp. from Izmir Bay and its vicinity (Aegean Sea, eastern Mediterranean) showed that these specimens belonged to a species new to the Mediterranean fauna, Chaetozone corona. This species was previously reported from the coasts of southern California (type locality) and western Atlantic (Brazil). It was only found at stations where the environment was more or less degraded due to high loads of organic matter from Izmir city and tuna-fish farms. As it was widely distributed in the area and existed among material collected in 1980 in Izmir Bay, it is not certain if this is an alien or native species. At this stage, its status should be considered as cryptogenic. To give a reliable conclusion, previous reports of C. setosa as a pollution indicator species in the Mediterranean dating from 1927, should be re-examined. The present study provides more information on the morphology, ecology and reproduction of C. corona.
