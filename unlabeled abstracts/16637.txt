Polyploidy, alien species and invasiveness in Polish angiosperms
Chromosome numbers, mainly for Polish flora, were examined in order to investigate whether such features as chromosome numbers and polyploid frequencies are correlated with a plant's origin (native vs. alien) and invasiveness. Polyploid frequencies were estimated using three methods: the 11 and 14 thresholds and the 3.5 x value. Comparisons of the 2n values were done on different levels: in all angiosperms and in dicots and monocots separately. Invasive and non-invasive plants were compared in the entire dataset and in alien species only. Significant differences in both chromosome numbers and polyploid frequencies between alien and native species were observed. In most cases, native plants had more chromosomes and were more abundant in polyploids than in alien species. Also, monocots had higher polyploid frequencies than dicots. Comparisons of invasive and non-invasive plants done for all of the data and only for alien species showed that invasive species generally had more chromosomes and polyploids were more frequent in them than in the latter group; however, these differences were not always statistically significant. Possible explanations for these observations are discussed.
