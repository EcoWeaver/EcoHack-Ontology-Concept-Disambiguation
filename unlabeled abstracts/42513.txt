Invasive Species and Biosecurity: Cost of Monitoring and Controlling Mediterranean Fruit Flies in Florida
The growing movement of people and goods that started in the closing years of the twentieth century has increased the possibility of the accidental or intentional introduction of biohazards that can affect agricultural production in the United States. This study examines the ex ante decision between the deployment of monitoring devices (traps) versus the use of countermeasures to control Mediterranean fruit flies in Florida. To examine this tradeoff, this study outlines a mathematical model to study the effectiveness of traps and the cost of treatment. The empirical results presented in this study indicate that additional parameterization efforts are needed.
