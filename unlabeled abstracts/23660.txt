Habitat preferences of cattail species and hybrids (Typha spp.) in eastern Canada
Interspecific hybridization is widespread in plants and is an important evolutionary process. Hybrids may be fitter than their parental species, at least under some environmental conditions, and this may lead to partitioning of taxa by habitat. In eastern Canada, two cattail species (Typha latifolia and Typha angustifolia) and their hybrid (Typha x glauca) are known to have become increasingly widespread in recent decades, although their habitat preferences and patterns of co-existence at the local scale are not well known. We quantified the occurrence of these three taxa in three different habitat types (high traffic, low traffic, and 'natural') at 40 different sites along a sampling route of approximately 2000 km in eastern Canada. There were no significant overall associations between habitat type and taxon, although intraspecific comparisons among sites showed that the hybrid was most likely to grow in high traffic (highly disturbed) sites. In addition, pairwise comparisons revealed significant independence of T. latifolia and T. angustifolia, although the hybrid was equally likely to co-exist with either of its parental species. The presence of the three taxa in several habitats, including highly disturbed roadside areas, is consistent with their increasingly invasive tendencies.
