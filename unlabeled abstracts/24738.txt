New record of Illinoia liriodendri (Hemiptera: Aphididae) from Korea: North American exotic on tulip tree, Liriodendron tulipifera
The genus Illinoia is found primarily in North America. Illinoia (Illinoia) liriodendri (Monell in Riley and Monell), the tulip tree aphid, is recognized for the first time in Korea. Colonies of I. liriodendri were found on tulip trees, Liriodendron tulipifera L. (Magnoliaceae), in Osan and Seoul, Korea. Illinoia liriodendri feeds on the underside of tulip tree leaves. We report the tulip tree aphid with re-descriptions, illustrations, and measurements for apterous and alate viviparous females.
