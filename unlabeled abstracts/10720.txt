Siebold's Viburnum, Viburnum sieboldii Miquel, New Non-Native Species Record for New York
Viburnum sieboldii Miq. is native to Japan but has gotten a foothold in the wild in North America, having been cultivated here for some time. The species is growing out of cultivation and is often reproducing in New York City parks in the Bronx, Queens, and elsewhere in Westchester and Nassau counties. This is despite the fact that this species is almost completely ignored in the major U.S. botanical literature, and regional and local floras. There may be some potential for this plant to become locally abundant and outcompete native vegetation.
