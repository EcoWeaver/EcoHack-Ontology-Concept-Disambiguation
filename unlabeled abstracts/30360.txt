Transcriptome analysis of an invasive weed Mikania micrantha
As an initial step towards understanding the molecular mechanisms by which plants become invasive, we present here the first transcriptome analysis for an invasive weed Mikania micrantha. The analysis was based on the 75-nucleotide short reads data generated by the Illumina Genome Analyzer II system. A total of 31 131 unique sequences were assembled de novo based on 8.7 million filtered paired-end sequence reads for the transcriptome of an individual M. micrantha growing in the field. 73 % of the unique sequences showed significant similarity to existing proteins in the NCBI database, and 21 448 could be grouped based on gene ontology assignments. Of particular interest are the sequences that share homology with genes involved in genome evolution, plasticity, secondary metabolism and defense responses.
