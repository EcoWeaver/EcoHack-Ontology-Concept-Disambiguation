The slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata Linnaeus, 1758 becomes established in Ireland
Chains and solitary individuals of the slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata were found, some with egg capsules, at several localities within Belfast Lough on the north-east coast of Ireland during 2009. The species is widely dispersed, being found on the lower shore to depths of 7 m attached to scallops, mussels and stones and so is considered to be established. Shell winter growth checks indicated a possible arrival in or before 2004. While there have been previous records of this invasive species in Ireland, this is the only known established population.
