Assessment of the Environmental Risk Posed by an Exotic Fish: The Proposed Introduction of Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) to New Zealand
There is a high probability that fish would escape and that they would be capable of breeding and growing in a wide range of freshwater environments throughout much of New Zealand. Because channel catfish are omnivorous, they would probably prey on at least some native fish species and introduced salmonids, invertebrates including freshwater crayfish, and aquatic macrophytes. Competition to the detriment of other fishes is also likely. The low species diversity and ecological simplicity of fish communities in New Zealand could allow channel catfish opportunities not found within their natural range. The environmental risk posed by the fish is considered to be unacceptable. -from Authors
