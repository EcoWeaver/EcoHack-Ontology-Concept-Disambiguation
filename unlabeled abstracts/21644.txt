First record of Diadema setosum (Leske, 1778) (Echinodermata, Echinoidea, Diadematidae) from Lebanon, Eastern Mediterranean
The Eastern Mediterranean basin is facing a high invasion rate of mainly Indo-Pacific species entering through the Suez Canal. The needle-spined urchin, Diadema setosum, was first documented in the Mediterranean in 2006 off southern Turkey. The new record of D. setosum in September 2009 represents the first evidence of its presence in Lebanese coastal waters.
