Optimizing dispersal study design by Monte Carlo simulation
These guidelines for sampling design are based on results from a wide range of conditions but still relatively simple scenarios. In some cases it may be necessary to consider more complicated situations. Two cases in point are direction-dependent and stratified or mixed dispersal kernels (Shigesada & Kawasaki 1997; Higgins, Nathan & Cain 2003). The simulation approach can still be used to address such problems, but may need different model formulations and/or additional information. Direction-dependent kernels will require a different specification of the seed shadow (equation 1) in which the distance and direction kernels (f and g) are joined. Stratified kernels may be problematic if the researcher does not have any idea that the true kernel is stratified, or of the scale of different strata. However, once some information about the strata is available (e.g. through pilot studies or from basic knowledge of the dispersal mechanisms of the species), the approach we have described is applicable and useful. The simulation method is also applicable to other systems and sampling methods, such as collections of point sources (briefly explored by Stoyan & Wagner 2001 for small collections of trees), mark-release-recapture (Purse, Hopkins & Day 2003) and tracking of individuals (J. M. Bullock, K. Shea & O. Skarpaas, unpublished data). It requires only minor changes to the algorithms to represent appropriately the positions and strengths of propagule sources and sampling technique (e.g. recording the distances moved by all released propagules rather than the numbers of seeds in a sample determined by trap locations and sizes).
