First record of two invasive species of Crypticerya (Hemiptera: Monophlebidae) causing outbreaks in urban green areas of Guayas Province, Ecuador
The scale insect genus Crypticerya Cockerell, 1895 (Hemiptera: Coccomorpha: Monophlebidae: Iceryini) is mainly distributed in the New World and includes numerous pest species despite being a relatively small group. Ovisacs have longitudinal flutes or grooves in those species that produce them, hence their common name "fluted scales"." In the present study, Crypticerya multicicatrices Kondo & Unruh and Crypticerya genistae (Hempel) are reported for the first time from Ecuador. The two species of fluted scales were found to cause outbreaks in urban green areas in Guayas province on the Ecuadorian coast, attacking native and alien plants. Eighty-five and eleven new host plant species were recorded for C. multicicatrices and C. genistae, respectively. Both invasive fluted scales prefer hosts in the family Fabaceae. No significant differences in the infestation levels of C. multicicatrices and C. genistae were found between native and alien host-plant species. In general, C. multicicatrices prefers trees as hosts, whereas C. genistae prefers herbaceous plants and shrubs. Both species are considered serious pests in urban green areas, associated with sooty molds, yellowing of leaves, and, in some cases, tree dieback. Management strategies to control the fluted scales are discussed briefly.
