Larval development and post-larval growth of Branchiomma bairdi (Annelida: Sabellidae) from a Mediterranean population
Branchiomma bairdi is a Caribbean fan worm introduced in several localities worldwide, including the Mediterranean Sea, where the species' range has rapidly expanded. Reproduction in B. bairdi was previously investigated in both extra-Mediterranean and Mediterranean areas, but no information is available on larval development and post-larval growth. In the present article, we examined these features for a population from the Mar Grande of Taranto (Ionian Sea). The species is hermaphrodite, and fertilization occurs in situ. Mucus seems to play an important role in fertilization, and also in preserving eggs before fertilization. The trochophore stage develops within the mucus and after hatching, larvae swim for about 3 d before settlement. The trochophore showed a distinct prototroch and two red dorsolateral larval eyes. The pelagic stage takes only 96 h even though prototroch is maintained after settlement, disappearing at 5 d, when larvae showed three chaetigers and branchial crown consisted of four radioles. Some interesting observations concerning changes in the morphology of chaetae and in the number of uncini during growth are also reported, together with discussion of the development of stylodes, an important diagnostic feature in Branchiomma species identification.
