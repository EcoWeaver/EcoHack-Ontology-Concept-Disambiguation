Indigenous and introduced species of the Bemisia tabaci complex in sweet potato crops from Argentina
Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam) is one of the most important crops worldwide. Recently, the appearance of severe viral symptoms has been observed in sweet potato crops in the pampas region of Argentina and both begomovirus and crinivirus, exclusively transmitted by whiteflies, have been identified. The aim of this study was to identify B. tabaci species from sweet potato crops in Colonia Caroya by analysing mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) sequences. Two previously described haplotypes were identified: New World2 (indigenous species) and MEAM1 (introduced species). The results indicate the presence of both species, which are potential vectors of begomovirus and crinivirus in Argentina.
