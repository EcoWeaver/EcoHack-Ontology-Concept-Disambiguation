Differential tolerance of the woody invasive Hakea sericea to drought and terminal heat stress
Abstract Drought and extreme temperatures are likely to be more common and intense in the Mediterranean region as a consequence of climate change. Both stresses usually arise together in the field, but our understanding of their joint influence on the performance of invasive alien species (IAS) is limited. Thus, the main objective of the present study is to fill this gap by analyzing the individual and combined effects of drought and terminal heat stress on the leaf physiology, biochemistry and growth of Hakea sericea Schrader, one of the most problematic IAS in the Mediterranean-type ecosystems. In this study, 1-year-old plants of H. sericea were exposed to four treatments under controlled conditions: control (CT), drought (DS), terminal heat stress (Ht), and combined Ht and DS (DHt). The DS treatment alone caused a marked reduction in shoot biomass, net photosynthetic (A) rate and stomatal conductance, while increasing the proline content, as compared with CT plants. In turn, the Ht treatment promoted the accumulation of malondialdehyde but hastened the decline in all gas exchange parameters, and also decreased leaf photosynthetic pigments, carotenoids, proline and relative water contents Exposure of H. sericea plants to the combined DHt exacerbated the impacts of Ht, which was accompanied by significant decreases in net photosynthetic and transpiration rates, and intrinsic water-use efficiency. Principal component analysis clearly separated the DHt from the other treatments and revealed similarities between DS and CT treatment. These findings suggest that xerothermic weather conditions might modify the fitness, competitive ability, resilience and spread of this IAS, thereby providing opportunities for its control.
