Measuring Bahamian lionfish impacts to marine ecological services using habitat equivalency analysis
3) deliver a tool to quantify changes in ecosystem services as a consequence of invasive species impacts and control. We found that the invader imposed losses of 26.67 and 21.67 years to recruitment and biomass services per km 2 of Bahamian reef if left uncontrolled. In the same accord, the most conservative Bahamian lionfish removal regime mod-eled, i.e., which produced a 50 % recovery of pre-lionfish ecosystem function over 10 years, provided service gains of 9.57 and 4.78 years per km 2. These data deliver a platform upon which to quantify present and future fiscal costs of the lionfish invasion and also to value lionfish control efforts.
