Spatial behaviour of a female raccoon (Procyon lotor) at the edge of the species' European distribution range
A female raccoon was radio-tracked in Luxembourg, at the edge of the species distribution range in Europe, from April 2004 to June 2004. The 100% minimum convex polygon home range size of 340ha was smaller than home ranges reported from the core of the species European distribution range in Lower Saxony, Germany. The animal mostly used Norway spruce as resting sites and appeared to exhibit no site fidelity.
