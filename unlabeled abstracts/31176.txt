Invasion ecology of the alien tussock grassNardus stricta(Poaceae) at Lake Pukaki, Canterbury, New Zealand
The European matgrass Nardus stricta has naturalised in New Zealand, often on damp soils within wetlands and grasslands. In this paper, we present for the first time field data on the ecology of this alien invader in New Zealand, from eight kettle-hole wetlands on lateral moraine along the western side of Lake Pukaki, South Canterbury. The invaded wetland sites were all acidic but varied in other soil characteristics. Nardus stricta was the most dominant species within these wetland communities with 40% of all plots showing more than 50% coverage, and 21% having more than 90% cover. Species richness (including vascular plants and mosses) at some sites was relatively high (c. 40 species), but species richness and abundance were significantly reduced in quadrats with high Nardus stricta density. Seedling densities of Nardus stricta were high but variable (overall mean of 38.6 +- 116 seedlings per m), and establishment mainly occurred on the cushion-forming sedge Oreobolus pectinatus. Most reproductive tussocks (90%) produced up to 1000 florets, but single tussocks were able to produce up to 10000 and more florets. Our results suggest that Nardus stricta is still expanding its local range and, therefore, is likely to increase in abundance and dominance, resulting in further negative effects on native species diversity.
