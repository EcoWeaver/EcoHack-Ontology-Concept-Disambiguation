Importance of lethal control of invasive predators for island conservation
We support the call of Wallach et al. (2015a) for a compassionate approach to conservation, and agree that any lethal control must be justified by a high probability of conservation gains and supported by relevant stakeholders. We believe that lethal control of invasive predators is justified when it will reverse the negative impacts of predators introduced by humans on native species and ecosystems, and when the extent of that predation endangers the survival of entire populations or species. Globally a few key introduced predator species are having disproportionately large effects on island ecosystems and their constituent species (e.g. Towns et al. 2006; Medina et al. 2011). Where invasive predators are killed to achieve conservation goals, we believe this can come from compassion for all of the ecosystem, its species, the individuals being protected, and the invasive animals themselves. This view is well supported by literature and policies relating to the role of animal welfare, animal rights, and environmental ethics in pest control programmes (e.g. Gunn 2007; Dunlevy et al. 2011).
