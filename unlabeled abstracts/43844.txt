Isolation of viable Babesia bovis merozoites to study parasite invasion
AbstractBabesia parasite invades exclusively red blood cell (RBC) in mammalian host and induces alterations to host cell for survival. Despite the importance of Babesia in livestock industry and emerging cases in humans, their basic biology is hampered by lack of suitable biological tools. In this study, we aimed to develop a synchronization method for Babesia bovis which causes the most pathogenic form of bovine babesiosis. Initially, we used compound 2 (C2), a specific inhibitor of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), and a derivative of C2, ML10. While both inhibitors were able to prevent B. bovis egress from RBC and increased percentage of binary forms, removal of inhibitors from culture did not result in a synchronized egress of parasites. Because using PKG inhibitors alone was not efficient to induce a synchronized culture, we isolated viable and invasive B. bovis merozoites and showed dynamics of merozoite invasion and development in RBCs. Using isolated merozoites we showed that BbVEAP, VESA1-export associated protein, is essential for parasite development in the RBC while has no significant role in invasion. Given the importance of invasion for the establishment of infection, this study paves the way for finding novel antigens to be used in control strategies against bovine babesiosis.
