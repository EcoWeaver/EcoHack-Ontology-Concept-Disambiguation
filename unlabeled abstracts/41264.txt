Chromosome-level genome assembly of Bactrocera dorsalis reveals its adaptation and invasion mechanisms
Bactrocera dorsalis is an invasive polyphagous pest causing considerable ecological and economic damage worldwide. We report a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly and combine various transcriptome data to explore the molecular mechanisms of its rapid adaptation to new environments. The expansions of the DDE transposase superfamily and key gene families related to environmental adaptation and enrichment of the expanded and unique gene families in metabolism and defence response pathways explain its environmental adaptability. The relatively high but not significantly different expression of heat-shock proteins, regardless of the environmental conditions, suggests an intrinsic mechanism underlying its adaptation to high temperatures. The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway plays a key role in adaptation to new environments. The prevalence of duplicated genes in its genome explains the diversity in the B. dorsalis complex. These findings provide insights into the genetic basis of the invasiveness and diversity of B. dorsalis , explaining its rapid adaptation and expansion.
