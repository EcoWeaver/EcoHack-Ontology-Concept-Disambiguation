A century of intermittent eco-evolutionary feedbacks resulted in novel trait combinations in invasive Great Lakes alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus)
Introduction Species introductions provide opportunities to quantify evolutionary change in response to novel environments. Alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus ) are native to the East Coast of North America where they typically ascend coastal rivers to spawn in lakes, and then return to the ocean. Some populations have become landlocked within the last 350 years and diverged phenotypically from ancestral marine populations. More recently alewives were introduced to the Laurentian Great Lakes (~150 years ago). Methods and Results We quantified 95 years of evolution in foraging traits and overall body shape of Great Lakes alewives, East Coast anadromous, and landlocked populations. We found that gill raker spacing in Great Lakes alewives has evolved in a dynamic pattern that is consistent with responses to strong but intermittent eco-evolutionary feedbacks with zooplankton size. Body shape in Great Lakes populations shows remarkable parallel evolution with East Coast landlocked populations, likely due to the loss of long-distance movement or migrations. Discussion Our results suggest the colonization of a new environment and cessation of migration can result in rapid parallel evolution in some traits, but contingency also plays a role, and the complex and dynamic ecosystem of Great Lakes yielded novel trait combinations in alewives.
