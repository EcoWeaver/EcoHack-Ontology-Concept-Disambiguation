Molecular evidence of hybridization in Florida's sheoak (Casuarina spp.) invasion
The presence of hybrids in plant invasions can indicate a potential for rapid adaptation and an added level of complexity in management of the invasion. Three Casuarina tree species, Casuarina glauca, Casuarina cunninghamiana and Casuarina equisetifolia, native to Australia, are naturalized in Florida, USA. Many Florida Casuarina trees are considered unidentifiable, presumably due to interspecific hybridization. We collected tissue from over 500 trees from Australia and Florida and genotyped these using amplified fragment length polymorphisms. Our goal was to determine the exact identity of the Florida species, including any putative hybrid combinations. In Australia, we found high assignment values to the three parental species, and no evidence of hybridization. In Florida, we found many trees with strong assignment to any one of the three species, as well as 49 trees with assignment values intermediate to C. glauca and C. equisetifolia, suggesting hybridization between these species. One population of 10 trees had assignment values intermediate to C. cunninghamiana and C. glauca, suggesting additional hybridization. For 69 of these putative hybrid and parental types, we sequenced a low-copy intron of nuclear G3pdh, and these sequences indicated that some Florida trees contain heterozygotic combinations of C. glauca and C. equisetifolia haplotypes. The presence of novel hybrids in the Florida invasion may enhance evolution of invasive traits in these species. Novel Casuarina hybrids in Florida have no coevolutionary history with any insects or diseases, which may be problematic for biological control efforts.
