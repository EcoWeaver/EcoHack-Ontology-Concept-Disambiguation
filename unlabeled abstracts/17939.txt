Introduced populations as genetic reservoirs for imperiled species: a case study of the Arkansas River Shiner (Notropis girardi)
The Arkansas River Shiner is a threatened species that has been extirpated throughout much of its native range (Arkansas River drainage) and remaining populations are imperiled. Prior to 1978, this species was accidently introduced to the Pecos River (Rio Grande drainage) via bait bucket, and has since persisted for over 30 years. Genetic data show that the Pecos River population maintains comparable levels of diversity at mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite loci relative to native range populations. Hence, we examined several factors that could be responsible for high introduced genetic diversity including (a) multiple introductions from genetically distinct sources (b) introduction of individuals from a genetically diverse source followed by rapid population expansion, (c) presence of life-history traits that foster propagule diversity and wide spatio-temporal demographic and genetic mixing; and (d) introduction to a suitable habitat in the non-native range. Our findings indicate Arkansas River Shiner was likely introduced from the Canadian River and subsequently experienced rapid population expansion that mitigated loss of diversity during the founding event. Threats to native Arkansas River Shiner have increased due to ongoing drought and water resource development, thus a finding of high diversity in the Pecos River suggests conservation significance of this non-native population. Further, it identifies the Pecos River as both a refuge for native endemic fishes and of genetic diversity of introduced, yet threatened, species.
