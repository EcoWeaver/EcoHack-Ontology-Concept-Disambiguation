Allelopathic potential of invasive species: Nicotiana glauca Graham on some ecological and physiological aspects of Medicago sativa L. and Triticum aestivum L
The present study is an attempt to evaluate and compare the allelopathic potentiality of the common invasive weed: Nicotiana glauca Graham (donor species) on germination, seedling growth, and protein expression of the two recipient crop species, Medicago sativa L. and Triticum aestivum L. Germination bioassay was conducted to investigate the biological activity of different concentration levels (25, 50, and 100%) of N. glauca shoot aqueous extract (NGSAE) on germination percentage (GP), radicle (RL), and coleoptile (CL) lengths of the two recipient species. Protein profile was also evaluated. GP of M. sativa seeds was stimulated at 25 and 50% extract concentration level, while T. aestivum achieved a GP of 100% at the maximum concentration level. RL and CL of M. sativa and T. aestivum showed more or less similar trend. Growth bioassay showed that the influence of 1-3% concentration levels of N. glauca shoot crude powder (NGSCP) on total proteins and antioxidants was positively remarkable. Meanwhile, seedling length and leaf area were negatively affected by NGSCP. In conclusion, results indicated that germination and growth of the recipient species were affected differentially by N. glauca aqueous extracts and shoot crude powder. Therefore, intensive laboratory work will be needed in future to explore the specific role for each weed and crop plant.
