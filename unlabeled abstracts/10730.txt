Alien taxa in the North American shrub-steppe four decades after cessation of livestock grazing and cultivation agriculture
Because of its use as a nuclear materials production area, the 800-km2 sagebrush steppe of the Columbia River Plain in Washington State has functioned as a quasi-natural area protected from livestock grazing and agricultural development since 1944. Alien vegetation and animals have invaded the eastern Washington region in the past century and are currently represented in the Columbia River Plain. Investigations were undertaken to evaluate the distribution of alien species, particularly vegetation, and their relationships to other flora and fauna in this region.
