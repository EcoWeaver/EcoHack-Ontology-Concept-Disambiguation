Assessing the biosecurity risk from pathogens and herbivores to indigenous plants: lessons from weed biological control
Some potentially invasive herbivores/pathogens in their home range may attack plants originating from another geographic area. Methods are required to assess the risk these herbivores/pathogens pose to these plants in their indigenous ecosystems. The processes and criteria used by weed biological control researchers to assess the impact of potential biological control agents on a plant species in its non-native range provide a possible framework for assessing risks to indigenous plants. While there are similarities between these criteria such as the need for clear objectives, studies in the native range of the herbivore/pathogen, good knowledge of the ecology of the target plant and taxonomy of the plant and herbivore/pathogen, and modelling of the interaction between the two organisms, there are some important differences in approach. These include the need to consider the threat classification of the plant, the likely greater risk from polyphagous herbivores/pathogens than oligophagous or monophagous species, and the need to consider the impact of an additional natural enemy in conjunction with a suite of existing natural enemies. The costs of conducting a risk assessment of a herbivore/pathogen in another country that damages plants indigenous to another geographic area means that criteria will be needed for deciding which foreign herbivore/pathogen species should be assessed. These criteria could include the threat classification of the plant, the amount of damage to the particular plant organs affected, and the importance in key ecosystems.
