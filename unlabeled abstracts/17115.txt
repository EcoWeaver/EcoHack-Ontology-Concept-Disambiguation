Competing food concepts - Implications for Hawai'i, USA
As public interest in food security continues in Hawai'i and elsewhere in the United States of America, so does the deluge of competing food concepts. Many issues in these overlapping concepts remain hazy, with various proponents advocating for different objectives. While food self-sufficiency is less desirable from an efficiency or trade standpoint, this does not preclude its usefulness for noneconomic policy objectives. In Hawai'i, free trade has opened a pathway for invasive species that is destructive to local agriculture, native species, and the host ecosystem. Due to Hawai'i geographic isolation and cultural diversity, many residents will support food concepts which promote the theme, "local production for local consumption, under local control," despite apparent advantages in food security which impacts more people in more places than other competing food concepts.
