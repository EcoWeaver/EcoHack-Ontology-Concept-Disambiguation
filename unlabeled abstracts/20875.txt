An oasis for alien benthic Foraminifera in the Aegean Sea
The benthic foraminiferal fauna in Pamucak Cove (NW Kusadasi, Turkey) was investigated. A rich foraminiferal assemblage was observed around submarine springs, which were located 200 m off the coast. This foraminiferal assemblage is typical Mediterranean. However, the abundance of alien species is noteworthy. Fourteen alien foraminifera were found. Indo-pacific originated species; Quinqueloculina sp. C, Triloculina sp. A, Pyramidulina catesbyi (d'Orbigny), Brizalina simpsoni (Heron-Allen and Earland) and Amphistegina lessonii d'Orbigny were observed for the first time on the Turkish coastline. Specimens of Haddonia sp. and Cymbaloporetta plana (Cushman), abundantly observed in SW Antalya and Nodopthalmidium antillarum (Cushman), previously recorded from Iskenderun were also found in the study area, these are the first records for these species in the Aegean Sea. In addition, seven individuals of Euthymonacha polita (Chapman) were found around the springs, and this constitutes the first record of this species in the entire Mediterranean Sea.
