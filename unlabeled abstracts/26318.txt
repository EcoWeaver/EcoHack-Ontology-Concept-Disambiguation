High Predation Pressure by an Introduced Flatworm on Land Snails on the Oceanic Ogasawara Islands
The introduction of a predatory flatworm, Platydemus manokwari, has been considered a cause of the decline of endemic land snails on the tropical oceanic islands. To clarify the effect of P. manokwarion land snail survival in the field, we examined survival rates of snails experimentally placed in areas where snails are absent (i.e., P. manokwariis present) on Chichijima, Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands. We found that over 50 and 90 percent of the snails were dead after 3 and 11 d, respectively, and that the main cause of mortality was predation by P. manokwari.
