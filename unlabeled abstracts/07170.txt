First evidence of resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in Italian Aedes albopictus populations after 26 years since invasion.
Background: Aedes albopictus has spread during the last decades all over the world. This has increased significantly the risk of exotic arbovirus transmission (e.g. Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika) also in temperate areas, as testified by the Chikungunya 2007- and 2017-outbreaks in north-east and central Italy. Insecticides represent a main tool for limiting the circulation of these mosquito-borne viruses. The aim of the present study is to start filling the current gap of knowledge on pyrethroid insecticide resistance of European Ae. albopictus populations focusing on populations from Italy, Albania and Greece. Results: Bioassays for resistance to permethrin (0.75%), a-cypermethrin (0.05%) or deltamethrin (0.05%) were performed according to WHO protocols and showed reduced susceptibility (<90% mortality) of some Italian populations to permethrin and a-cypermethrin, but not to deltamethrin. Conclusion: This study reports the first evidence of resistance to pyrethroids in adult Italian Ae. albopictus populations. Results refer to the season preceding the Chikungunya 2017-outbreak in central Italy and highlight the need to increase efforts to monitor insecticide resistance spreading and the need to develop strategies limiting the spread of insecticide resistance, particularly in areas where extensive treatments have been carried out to contain disease outbreaks.
