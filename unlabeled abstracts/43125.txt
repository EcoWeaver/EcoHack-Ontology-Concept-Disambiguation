An Approach towards Promoting Progress with the Control of Woody Alien Invasive Plants in Natal
Effective mechanical and chemical control techniques have been developed for almost all the important woody, alien, invasive plants in Natal. Despite this, progress with the actual control of these plants has been disappointing. Possible reasons for this include poor control practices, a lack of extension work, wrong attitudes and too much reliance on biological control. An approach is proposed which will address these and other problems. Research is to concentrate on the implementation of available control techniques to determine their cost-effectiveness when applied on a large scale and also over the long term, e.g. aspects such as post control management of the vegetation. This is to be done with the so-called "land-unit based" approach which will also serve to transfer the most suitable technology to the end-user.
