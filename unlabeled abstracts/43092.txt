Invasive Shrubs and Forest Tree Regeneration
Invasive shrubs are having important effects on forests in the United States. Over 100 species were found that have actual or potential effects on forest structure and function. The number of invasive shrub species in each state is correlated with both latitude and state population. The majority of these shrubs have attractive fruits that are widely distributed by birds and other animals. Their reproduction is also helped by evergreen or extended-deciduous leaf habits and by the ability to reproduce vegetatively in a majority of these invasive species. In addition to suppressing native tree reproduction, invasive shrubs have many other effects on forest function; however, information is not yet available in either of these categories for a substantial number of invasive shrubs. Because most of these species can resprout, physical control is of limited effectiveness, while herbicides are much more successful. Only limited research has been conducted on both fire and biological control. Despite these negative effects on forests, more than three quarters of these shrubs are still distributed in the United States, and many are unrecognized as invasive in many states. Substantial legislative, regulatory, and research efforts are therefore needed to limit the deleterious effects of invasive shrubs on U.S. forests.
