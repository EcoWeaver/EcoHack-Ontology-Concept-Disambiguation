Invasive Alternanthera philoxeroides (alligator weed) associated with increased fungivore dominance in Coleoptera on decomposing leaf litter
Invasive Alternanthera philoxeroides (alligator weed), when controlled by biocontrol agent Agasicles hygrophila, is known to differ from native vegetation in its decomposition dynamics. This study investigated whether this difference would have indirect effects for fungal-feeding Coleoptera. The study tested the hypothesis that fungivores would be more abundant and species rich on A. philoxeroides than on native vegetation. The study also tested the hypothesis that fungivores would be more affected than other functional groups. The study was conducted in a northern New Zealand lake. Litterbags were placed beneath A. philoxeroides and two native sedge species (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani and Isolepis prolifer). Coleoptera communities were examined from the litterbags. Fungivorous Coleoptera were more abundant and species rich beneath A. philoxeroides than beneath either sedge species. No other functional groups differed between cover types. Fungivorous Coleoptera also comprised a greater proportion of total Coleoptera catch from litterbags beneath A. philoxeroides cover than from beneath native sedge cover. Four of the six fungivorous Coleoptera species collected in the study were present beneath A. philoxeroides cover. Of these, the two most abundant species (on native, one exotic) were both from the family Corylophidae. Alternanthera philoxeroides invasion is thus associated with altered Coleoptera communities in this ecosystem.
