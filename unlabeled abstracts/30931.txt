Invasive weed species and their effects
An invasive weed exhibits a tendency to spread rapidly to occupy new niches. This chapter describes ten examples of situations in which invasive weeds directly affect agriculture. The chapter also examines indirect effects, and discusses how climate change and globalization interact to promote invasions. The chapter explores the potential contribution of integrated weed management (IWM) to managing and controlling weed invasions, and provides extensive further reading on the topic.
