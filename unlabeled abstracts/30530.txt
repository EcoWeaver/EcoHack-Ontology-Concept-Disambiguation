Collapse of the native ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua) population in the Biesbosch lakes (the Netherlands) owing to round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) invasion
We investigated the change in benthic fish communities in three artificial lakes of the Biesbosch area in the Netherlands between two time periods: before and after the invasion of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Native ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua), the dominant species in benthic gillnet and littoral beach seining catches before the invasion, almost completely disappeared in all lakes only 2 years after the invasion. We found a significant increase in 0 + perch (Perca fluviatilis) and, in some lakes, pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) abundance in gillnet catches after invasion. In the post-invasion period, the 0 + fish community was dominated by perch, and the older fish community was dominated by round goby. The species richness of 0 + fish increased in the post-invasion period owing to the invasion of gobiids. However, it did not change for older fish between periods. Our results clearly show that, owing to a similar benthic lifestyle and high niche overlap, ruffe was the only species negatively influenced by the round goby invasion. The competitive superiority of round goby over ruffe is so strong that the once-dominant species of the overall benthic fish community collapsed after only a few years of coexistence.
