Invasion: exotic ticks (Acari: Argasidae, Ixodidae) imported into the United States. A review and new records
A review of the literature and unpublished records from the U.S. National Tick Collection on the importation of ticks from foreign lands reveals that at least 99 exotic tick species assignable to 11 genera have been either detected and destroyed at ports of entry or inadvertently imported into the United States in the past half century. This number includes four argasid and 95 ixodid species, some of which are important vectors of agents that cause disease to both man and animals. If one includes Aponomma sp. and Hyalomma sp. and the subspecies of Rhipicephalus, the total exceeds 100 taxa. It is notable that the number of imported tick species recorded herein exceeds the total number of tick species native to the United States. It appears that the soft tick genera Argas, Antricola and Nothoaspis have not been imported, although at some point in time Argas persicus (Oken) was introduced because it is resident although not often collected. The hard tick genera Anomalohimalaya, Cosmiomma, Margaropus, Nosomma and Rhipicentor, and the nuttalliellid genus Nuttalliella have also not been imported.
