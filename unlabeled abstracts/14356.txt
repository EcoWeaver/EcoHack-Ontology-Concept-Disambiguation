First record of a population of the exotic mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus (L., 1766) in the Mediterranean Sea basin (Ebro River delta)
Until now, mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus have been recorded only from the estuaries of the southernmost river basins of the Iberian Peninsula (Guadiana and Guadalquivir Rivers). Data reported here indicate the first record of F. heteroclitus in the Ebro River delta (north-east Spain), and hence also the first citation for F. heteroclitus as an invasive species present in any estuary of the Mediterranean Sea basin.
