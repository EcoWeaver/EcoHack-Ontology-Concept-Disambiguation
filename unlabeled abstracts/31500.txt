First record of Stenochrus portoricensis Chamberlin, 1922 (Arachnida: Schizomida: Hubbardiidae) for caves in Brazil: evidence for a troglophile status of an exotic species
New records of Stenochrus portoricensis Chamberlin, 1922 are given, the first south-american record in caves and the first to Goias state in the Cerrado phytogeographical domain. Records of nine specimens (all females) in isolated regions from surface environment and deep zones in the cave suggest the status of troglophile (facultative cave-dwelling organisms) to this species. All specimens were found in places well preserved, without anthropization, differently from the observed to other records of the species in Brazil. Finally, we reinforce the need of replications on inventory studies of subterranean fauna.
