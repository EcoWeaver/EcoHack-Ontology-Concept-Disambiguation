Refining and expanding global climate change scenarios in the sea: Poleward creep complexities, range termini, and setbacks and surges
Invasion dynamics are sensitive to global-scale changes. New marine invasions have been recorded in dramatically increasing numbers along the world's coasts, due, in part, to the global warming of the oceans and the ability of many successful invasive marine species to tolerate a broader thermal range than native species. As a response to ocean warming, a poleward movement of numerous species has been observed in many biogeographic regions. Our aim was to explore several poorly recognized and thus rarely studied aspects of ocean climate change scenarios in order to advance our understanding of finer-grained aspects of poleward movements.
