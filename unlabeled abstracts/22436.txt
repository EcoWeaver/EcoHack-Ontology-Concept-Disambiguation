Agricultural matrix provides modest habitat value for ants on mixed farms in eastern Australia
Agricultural development has contributed to the global erosion of biodiversity. The farmed matrix in agricultural landscapes can and must be important for the conservation of biodiversity and provision of ecosystem services, but this assumes that the matrix has biodiversity value. We investigate the contribution of pastures and crops to ant diversity on mixed farms in eastern Australia. Remnant native woodlands, pastures of native grasses, sown pastures of exotic species, and crops were sampled for epigaeic ants on 3 farms using pitfall trapping. Ants were sorted to species and assigned to functional groups. Ant species richness and functionality followed consistent patterns across the three farms. Significant differences in assemblage composition were found between the major habitat types, and in species richness between woodland and non-woodland habitats (native and sown pastures, and crops), which did not contribute appreciably to farm-level biodiversity: 1-10% of species were found only in the farmed matrix. Insect conservation in agricultural landscapes is important for the provision of ecosystem services, including pest control and the maintenance of soil condition. As the farmed matrix makes only a modest contribution to farm-scale biodiversity, appropriate management of the unfarmed parts of the landscape is critical and habitat restoration may be warranted where the level of native vegetation is low. Maintaining a mix of land uses within the production matrix will also be a necessary bet-hedging strategy in a world with changing climates, commodities, community expectations and farming practices.
