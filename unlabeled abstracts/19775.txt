Modes and mechanisms of a Daphnia invasion
Whether exotic species invade new habitats successfully depends on (i) a change in the invaded habitat that makes it suitable for the invader and (ii) a genetic change in the invading taxon that enhances its fitness in the new habitat, or both. We dissect the causes of invasions of Swiss lakes, north of the Alps, by Daphnia galeata (a zooplankter typical of eutrophic lakes, e.g. those south of the Alps, which are also warmer) by comparing the fitness performance of eight geographically distributed clones that were fed algal-food typical of oligotrophic versus eutrophic conditions at two temperatures. Daphnia longispina, native to oligotrophic Swiss lakes, served as a reference. Daphnia galeata requires eutrophic food to persist, whereas D. longispina survives and grows on oligotrophic food but does even better on eutrophic food. Invasion by D. galeata is further explained because invading clones from the north perform better on eutrophic food and at cooler temperatures than native clones from the south, suggesting a local response to countergradient selection. Our data support the hypothesis that populations of the invader in northern lakes are dominated by well-adapted genotypes. Our results illustrate how environmental change (i.e. eutrophication) and local adaptation can act together to drive a successful invasion.
