Micro sites and seedling quality in restoration
In this review several studies by the Forest Sciences Division, University of Chapingo, Mexico are presented that have been conducted as part of the research programme The reforestation in the restoration, focused on seedling quality, microsites and, more recently, measurement of some processes to assess restoration. Some study cases for Mexican temperate species (a conifer, Pinus hartwegii, a broadleaf Quercus rugosa and a shrub Symphoricarpos microphyllus), and one subtropical species from the USA (Pinus palustris), as well as an exotic species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) are shown.
