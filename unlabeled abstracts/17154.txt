Predation on endemic Hawaiian land snails by the invasive snail Oxychilus alliarius
The native land snails of the Hawaiian Islands have suffered numerous extinctions and continue to decline rapidly. A leading cause of these extinctions has been the impact of non-native predators. Oxychilus alliarius is a European predatory snail that has been in Hawaii since at least 1937 and has become one of the most abundant invasive snails in the islands. It is a facultative carnivore and will also consume non-animal food. However, this species has been mostly ignored as a threat and the majority of conservation attention has been focused on Euglandina rosea, the Rosy Wolf Snail. Here we report predation by O. alliarius on two rare and endemic Hawaiian snail species: Kaala subrutila (Helicarionidae) and Pleuropoma cf. sandwichiensis (Helicinidae). The wide distribution of O. alliarius in Hawaii, its high abundance, and now compelling evidence that it preys on native (and probably endangered) snails, indicate that it could be a much greater threat than previously thought.
