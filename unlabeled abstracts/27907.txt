Successful reproduction of the introduced slider turtle(Trachemys scripta elegans) in the South of France
1.Massive importation of slider turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans) as a pet in France over the past few decades has been followed by the release of many of these turtles into natural environments. T. scripta elegans is now widely distributed in France.2.This paper reports on the successful reproduction of this species in France, with confirmed production of both sexes from nests incubated in the wild. These results indicate that the turtle T. scripta elegans can reproduce in the wild and that its long-term persistence is possible in France.3.The potential impact of this invasive species in natural ecosystems warrants future study. Meanwhile, authorities are strongly encouraged to educate the public to the potential danger of exotic species introduction for local ecosystems and to capture and remove this species from wetlands in southern Europe.
