Edaphic factors and feedback do not limit range expansion of an exotic invasive plant
Dog-strangling vine (Vincetoxicum rossicum, Apocynaceae) is an exotic invasive plant from Europe that is increasingly invasive in southern Ontario, Canada. The species is highly adaptive to light, soil moisture, and temperature. V. rossicum grows on calcareous soils in its native range. However, although this is currently consistent in its invaded range, its potential to spread to northern Ontario, with more acidic soils, is currently unknown. We tested the ability of V. rossicum to grow in soil from northern Ontario in comparison with southern Ontario soil. We also grew Solidago canadensis (Asteraceae), an ubiquitous and abundant native species that co-occurs with V. rossicum. We grew both species in soil collected from 26 sites in northern and southern Ontario. Soils were then used in a feedback study with both species to determine whether V. rossicum's invasion success could be explained, at least partially, by positive plant-soil feedback. We found that biomass of V. rossicum was not significantly different between soil types but S. canadensis had lower biomass in the northern than in southern Ontario soil. Soil feedback was neutral for both species, regardless of soil type. We conclude that the spread of V. rossicum into areas of central/northern Ontario will not be limited by soil type and that plant-soil feedback may not be an important factor driving V. rossicum's invasion.
