The Effect of Stand Size and Vegetational Background on the Colonization of Cruciferous Plants by Herbivorous Insects
(1) The colonization of collard plants (Brassica oleracea L., Cruciferae) by herbivorous insects was studied in stands of one, ten and 100 plants. The stands were cultivated in some experiments while in others they were uncultivated. The plants were grown in pots to assure uniformity under different experimental conditions. Colonization was assessed by direct counts in the field. The fauna did not respond as a unit to the spatial distribution of its host plant; each of the major herbivore species had its maximum colonization potential under different conditions of stand size. When the three most important species co-occurred, Pieris rapae was most abundant in the one-plant plots; Phyllotreta striolata was most abundant in the ten-plant plots and P. cruciferae was most abundant in the 100-plant plots. Aphid alatae were abundant but did not establish large colonies; they showed an inconsistent response to plot size. (2) Vegetational background of the plots had a significant effect on colonization. In uncultivated plots only Pieris rapae was a successful invader; the other species which occurred in cultivated plots were infrequent and not abundant. (3) The findings indicate that the diversity of the crucifer fauna is maintained by each species having a different pattern of colonization behaviour. Furthermore, it appears that many potential pest species preferentially colonize large pure stands of their host plants, a condition characteristic of cultivated plots.
