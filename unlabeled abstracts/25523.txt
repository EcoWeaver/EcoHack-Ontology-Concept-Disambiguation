Agamospermous seed production of the invasive tussock grass Nardus stricta L. (Poaceae) in New Zealand - evidence from pollination experiments
The breeding system of the European tussock grass Nardus stricta L. (Poaceae) was investigated with pollination experiments. Plants were sampled from two populations at Lake Pukaki, Canterbury, New Zealand, where the species is recognised as an alien invader. Bagging of flowers with king-sized cigarette paper and hand-pollination were used to test for three modes of reproduction in the greenhouse: (1) agamospermy (apomixis), (2) autogamy and self-compatibility, and (3) allogamy (outcrossing). Two control groups without experimental treatments were further tested for seed set under (1) greenhouse and (2) field conditions. The success or failure of all experimental treatments was assessed with seed set and germination trials. All agamospermy treatments showed high seed set and germination proportions arguing for an apomictic mode of reproduction in Nardus stricta. Cross-pollination treatments were also successful making it difficult to estimate the degree of outcrossing, selfing, and agamospermous seed production in Nardus stricta. Fecundity in field populations was considerably reduced, possibly due to environmental factors acting upon seed development during maturation. The reproductive strategy of Nardus stricta might be particularly beneficial during invasion because single tussocks can form reproducing colonies and high reproductive output is ensured even in the absence of pollination. Genetic studies in combination with pollination experiments would be necessary to gain deeper insights into the breeding strategy of Nardus stricta.
