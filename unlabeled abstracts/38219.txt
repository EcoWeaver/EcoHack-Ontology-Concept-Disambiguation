Competition between invasive Lemna minuta and native L. minor in indoor and field experiments
The invasion of aquatic ecosystems by introduced invasive alien species (IAS) has become a worldwide phenomenon, and often leads to competitive interactions with native species. At high-nutrient levels, native species mostly are outcompeted by the introduced species. We performed an outdoor competition experiment between IAS free-floating Lemna minuta and native Lemna minor in a eutrophicated pond to examine whether the invasive species is the better competitor. We additionally performed an indoor experiment resembling mesotrophic phosphorus (P) conditions to investigate both species' competitiveness in low P availability and compared with previous experiments at high-nutrient levels. Our results showed that in field conditions, the alien L. minuta was the better competitor. In the mesotrophic indoor condition, however, the native L. minor was the better competitor. Both species produced longer roots in the indoor experiment compared to field conditions. The species' relative growth rates were also lower in the indoor experiment. A P reduction to mesotrophic condition in the water column thus might reduce invasive L. minuta growth and competitive performance. Additionally, introduction and recovery of L. minor could reduce L. minuta cover, but only following P reduction. Field experiments in mesotrophic ponds are needed to confirm these indoor findings.
