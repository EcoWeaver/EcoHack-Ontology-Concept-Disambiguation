Density dependence in demography and dispersal generates fluctuating invasion speeds
Significance Mitigating the spread of invasive species remains difficult--substantial variability in invasion speed is increasingly well-documented, but the sources of this variability are poorly understood. We report a mechanism for invasion speed variability. The combined action of density dependence in demography and dispersal can cause invasions to fluctuate, even in constant environments. Speed fluctuations occur through creation of a pushed invasion wave that moves forward not from small populations at the leading edge but instead, from larger, more established populations that "jump" forward past the previous invasion front. Variability in strength of the push generates fluctuating invasion speeds. Conditions giving rise to fluctuations are widely documented in nature, suggesting that an important source of invasion variability may be overlooked.
