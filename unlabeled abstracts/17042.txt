Parallel variation among populations in the shell morphology between sympatric native and invasive aquatic snails
A phenotypic response, either plastic or evolved, is often required for successful invasion of novel environments. Populations of the invasive snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum have colonized a wide range of environments in the western U. S. since 1985, but the extent of plastic adjustment and evolved adaptation to local environments is largely unknown. We examined variation in shell morphology among four sites in the Snake River, Idaho, including both still-water and free-flowing river habitats and compared the variation to that of a native snail (Pyrgulopsis robusta) using geometric morphometric techniques. Using Generalized Procrustes analysis, we tested for phenotypic responses by determining (1) whether Po. antipodarum from the four locations differed in shell morphology, and (2) whether these snails exhibited corresponding shell shape variation with sympatric populations of a native snail. Both native and invasive snails exhibited similar variation in shell morphology across three of the four sites. The Canonical Variate assignment test grouped 85 % of both snail species to their rightful sample site. In addition, the Principal Component Analysis displayed similar patterns of shell variation across the four sites, indicating parallel variation in shell shape. For three of the four sites, both the native and invasive snails exhibited differences in shell shape consistent with water flow variation (still-water versus fast free-flowing river). Taken together, these results suggest that the shell shape of the invasive snail has changed either through plasticity or evolution, and that both native and invasive snail populations responded to local environmental conditions in a similar manner.
