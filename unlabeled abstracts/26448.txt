Construction of an eco-island: A case study of Chongming Island, China
Chongming Island is the largest alluvial island in the world and is an ecologically sensitive area. It has been planned as a world famous eco-island for future development. Eco-island is a special concept of sustainable development for a small island. This paper explores the applicability of the eco-island concept with respect to six characteristics: integrated ecosystem structure and function, powerful ecological security defense system, sustainable use of natural resources, prosperous and stable eco-economy, comfortable human habitats, and widespread ecological civilization. Combining the concept of eco-island and the vulnerability and disturbance factors the island faced, this paper presents some primary strategies for the eco-island construction. These strategies include wetland protection, control of exotic species, renewable energy programs, integrated water-systems and land-resource management, eco-economic development, and construction of ecological demonstration villages and communities. Implementation of these strategies will improve residents' quality of life, as well as enhance the resistance of the island's ecosystem and relieve island ecological pressure from human activities.
