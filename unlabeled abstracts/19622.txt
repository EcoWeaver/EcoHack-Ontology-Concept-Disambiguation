Community ecology of absent species: hidden and dark diversity
Community ecologists have so far focused mainly on species identified at a site. I suggest that we can understand better patterns and their underlying processes in ecological communities if we also examine those species absent from the sampled community. However, there are various types of absences, which all harbour different information. Hidden diversity comprises species that are absent from our sight: dormant or locally very rare species overlooked by traditional sampling. Fortunately, modern DNA-based techniques can help us to find hidden species when analysing environmental samples. Depending on habitat type and sampling scale, a large number of co-existing species might be hidden. Dark diversity comprises absent species that constitute the habitat-specific species pool. Dark diversity can be determined based on data on species distribution, dispersal potential and ecological requirements. If we know both observed and dark diversity, we can estimate community completeness and infer those processes that determine which species in the species pool actually co-exist locally. In addition, most species in the world do not actually belong to the habitat-specific species pool of the community: their ecological requirements differ or their distribution area is elsewhere. Such other absent species are usually not directly relevant to a particular community. However, knowing ecologically suitable species from other regions can give early warning of possible future invasion of alien species (alien dark diversity). To conclude, species presences have meaning only if there are absences (and vice versa). Methods to detect absent species are rapidly developing and will soon form a standard toolbox for community ecology.
