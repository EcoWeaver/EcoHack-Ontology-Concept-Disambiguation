Ecological long-term effects of cultigens becoming feral and of naturalization of non-native species
Transgenic cultigens may become feral as we know of some non-transgenic cultigens. The article explains two basic ways how cultigens become feral: through hybridization with a closely related wild plant and through revert to the wild-type. A long list of examples of cultigens becoming feral in Central Europe is presented. The process of becoming feral is compared to the naturalization of non-native species (Exotic Species Model). Ecological long-term effects of both cultigens becoming feral and non-native species being naturalized are discussed with special regard to the predictability of such events. The ecological aspects discussed in the article are as significant for transgenic cultigens as for non-transgenic cultigens.
