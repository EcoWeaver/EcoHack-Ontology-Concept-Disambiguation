Non-invasive sampling: reliable methods for DNA extraction and PCR amplification from a single scale of small Cyprinidae fish
The present study was aimed to DNA extraction and PCR amplification of mitochondrial DNA of a varied size range using the non-invasive samples of fish. As many obstacles arise when obtaining an adequate amount of DNA from samples of endangered species, using non-invasive methods of sample collection and DNA extraction should be developed. To this end, we tested and standardised the reliable methods based on DNA extraction from a single scale of small Cyprinidae fish Pethia conchonius. In total, 13 specimens were used for DNA extraction, including 7 single scales and multiple scales. The DNA fragments of different length representing four mitochondrial fragments of different genes were amplified with a variable success after DNA extracted from a single scale, multiple scales or fish clips was used in PCR reactions. All examined DNA samples extracted from a single scale provided 100% amplification success of up to 381 base pairs fragments. Methods described here have a great applicability in DNA extraction from the small size fish and could be useful in conservation genetics as well as in wildlife forensics.
