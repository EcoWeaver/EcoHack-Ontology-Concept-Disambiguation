Ecosystem changes and nuisance benthic algae on the southeast shores of Lake Huron
We conducted studies of algal fouling along the southeastern shore of Lake Huron to determine the kinds and spatial distribution of benthic algae, the spatial extent and timing of beach fouling, and the possible influences of biological changes to Lake Huron. There was no change in the physical texture of the substratum, but coverage by algal turf increased from 11% of sites in 1977 to nearly 90% in 2007. Shoreline surveys showed that Chara was most common on flat rocky substrata at depths of 0.15 to 0.20 m. Algae stranded on beaches consisted of 62% periphyton turf, 30% Chara and 8% Cladophora and were not evenly distributed; the largest accumulations were found where shoreline irregularities interrupted longshore flow. Quantities of stranded algae partially reflected the height and duration of waves directed onshore. Macroinvertebrate densities were not correlated with benthic algal abundance in 2010 and were lower with fewer large grazers than in 1980. Densities of Dreissena spp. increased with depth, and small tufts of Cladophora were found on larger individuals. The proliferation of algae in the nearshore zone of central eastern Lake Huron appears to be the result of several recent changes. Phosphorus management and filtering by dreissenid mussels have reduced phytoplankton abundance, improving the light regime. Changes in land use may have increased loadings of phosphorus through shallow groundwater and tributary streams. Dreissenids have also redirected nutrients to the lakebed, further enhancing benthic primary production, and predation by round goby has reduced the numbers of grazing benthic invertebrates.
