Live bait capture and crayfish trapping as potential vectors for freshwater invasive fauna
Fishing activities strongly contribute to biological invasions in freshwaters. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential risks of live bait capture using dip nets and of crayfish trapping as vectors for invasive freshwater macrofauna dispersal. In the Tagus river basin (Portugal), where both activities are common, we evaluated the probability of capture and the electivity of the local aquatic macrofauna according to the method used. During the compulsory removal of the invasive species captured we also quantified fish desiccation survival capacities. We found, for both vectors, that the species exhibiting the highest probability of capture and the highest electivity were invasive, respectively, Gambusia holbrooki and Crangonyx pseudogracilis with the dip net, Procambarus clarkii and several invasive species with special relevance for Ameiurus melas with the crayfish trapping. Moreover, the desiccation survival capacities, of all invasive fishes analyzed, are compatible with long distance dispersal out of water, with special relevance to G. holbrooki. This study demonstrates that fishing activities contribute to long-distance dispersal of invasive fauna. Therefore, according to our findings, it is important to update the fishing regulation and simultaneously to raise fishermen awareness of this problem.
