Daphnia lumholtziin the Mobile River Drainage, USA: Invasion of a Habitat That Experiences Salinity
We found the nonnative zooplankter Daphnia lumholtzi across 50 km of the lower Mobile-Tensaw River Delta, Alabama, USA, including a downstream site at the head of Mobile Bay. D. lumholtzi regularly occurred at sites that experienced salinity and was found in waters with salinity up to 1.5 g/L. The occurrence of D. lumholtzi in coastal waters containing salinity suggests that systems other than purely freshwater systems are also susceptible to invasion.
