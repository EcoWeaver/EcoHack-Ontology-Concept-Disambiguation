Geographie des termites souterrains en region Centre-Val de Loire : le risque d'une espece invasive
This study presents research concerning subterranean termites found in the Centre-Val de Loire region. More specifically, we examined the geographical distribution of Reticulitermes flavipes, a globally invasive species. This work was conducted in collaboration with both social and life science specialists in order to better understand the factors mediating its spatial distribution. Using geomatics and the spatial analysis of R. flavipes' distribution, we were able to define geographical areas favorable to the termite. This geographical study and the diversity of players involved in this research underscore a growing awareness of termite invasion risks in society at large.
