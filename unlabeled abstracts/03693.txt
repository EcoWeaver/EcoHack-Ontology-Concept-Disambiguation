An ideal weed: plasticity and invasiveness in Polygonum cespitosum
The introduced Asian plant Polygonum cespitosum has only recently become invasive in northeastern North America, spreading into sunny as well as shaded habitats. We present findings from a multiyear case study of this ongoing species invasion, drawing on field environmental measurements, glasshouse plasticity and resurrection experiments, and molecular genetic (microsatellite) data. We focus in particular on patterns of individual phenotypic plasticity (norms of reaction), their diversity within and among populations in the species' introduced range, and their contribution to its potential to evolve even greater invasiveness. Genotypes from introduced-range P. cespitosum populations have recently evolved to express greater adaptive plasticity to full sun and/or dry conditions without any loss of fitness in shade. Evidently, this species may evolve the sort of "general-purpose genotypes" hypothesized by Herbert Baker to characterize an "ideal weed." Indeed, we identified certain genotypes capable of extremely high reproductive output across contrasting conditions, including sunny, shaded, moist, and dry. Populations containing these high-performance genotypes had consistently higher fitness in all glasshouse habitats; there was no evidence for local adaptive differentiation among populations from sunny, shaded, moist, or dry sites. Norm of reaction data may provide valuable insights to invasion biology: the presence of broadly adaptive, high-performance genotypes can promote a species' ecological spread while providing the fuel for increased invasiveness to evolve.
