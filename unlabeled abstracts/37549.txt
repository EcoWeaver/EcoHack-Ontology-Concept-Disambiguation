Global analysis of ecological niche conservation and niche shift in exotic populations of monkeyflowers (Mimulus guttatus, M. luteus) and their hybrid (M. x robertsii)
Background Hybridisation associated with biological invasions may generate new phenotypic combinations, allowing hybrids to occupy new ecological niches. To date, few studies have assessed niche shifts associated with hybridisation in recently introduced populations while simultaneously characterising the niche of parental species in both native and introduced ranges. Aims Here, we compared (1) the ecological niche of a novel hybrid monkeyflower, M. x robertsii, with the niches of its two parental taxa (M. guttatus, M. luteus), and (2) the ecological niches of native (Americas) and introduced parental populations (Europe and New Zealand). Methods We assembled >13,000 geo-referenced occurrence records and eight environmental variables and conducted an ecological niche model analysis using maximum entropy, principal component and niche dynamics analysis. Results We found no evidence of niche shift in the hybrid, which may result in potential competition between parental and derived taxa in the introduced range. M. guttatus showed niche conservatism in introduced populations in Europe, but a niche shift in New Zealand, while M. luteus showed a niche shift in Europe. Conclusions The comparison of native and non-native populations of parental taxa, suggests that whether invasions result in niche shifts or not depends on both taxon and geographic region, highlighting the idiosyncratic nature of biological invasions.
