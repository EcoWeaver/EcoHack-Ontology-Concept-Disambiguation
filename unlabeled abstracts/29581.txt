Potential threat of introduced rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss to native salmonids in the western part of Hokkaido, Japan
We obtained the following five results in 10 rivers while elucidating the potential threat of introduced rainbow trout to native salmonids. First, native salmonid density decreased with increasing trout density. Second, four environmental variables, namely altitude, distance from the sea, river width, and river depth, did not significantly affect trout density. Third, the distribution of trout expanded, and trout were the dominant species in an unconfined river. Fourth, the trout invasion has changed salmonid faunas over the last 20 years. Lastly, smolt trout were collected from a river. Therefore, the potential threat to native salmonids due to trout introduction is continuously increasing.
