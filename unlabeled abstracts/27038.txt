A review of the pest status and control options for Thrips palmi
Thrips palmi Karny, the melon thrips, has spread widely and rapidly in tropical and subtropical regions, but despite a number of outbreaks (all successfully eradicated) and regular interceptions, it remains absent from Europe. Considerable experience of managing this pest has been gained in different countries as it has spread around the world. Control measures for T. palmi are reviewed and discussed, primarily in the context of measures available in the UK for use against future outbreaks. Recent reports of successful control of T. palmi in countries, to which it has recently spread, are also reviewed. The emphasis is on chemical insecticides for eradication of this quarantine pest, although biological, cultural and physical measures are also covered.
