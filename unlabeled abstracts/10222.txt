From the Western Palaearctic region to beyond: Tuta absoluta 10 years after invading Europe
The South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is a devastating pest currently threatening the global tomato industry worldwide. In the last 10 years, it has spread and expanded to most of Europe, Africa and Asia, causing extensive damage to the crop itself and to the international tomato trade. With the aim of providing an overview of the current knowledge on this pest, we have briefly reviewed the available literature relying on its spread, quarantine, modeling and management. Finally, we have underlined the gaps in knowledge and provided several recommendations on how to achieve sustainable control as well as how to prevent further spread into unaffected areas.
