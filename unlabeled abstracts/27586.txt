Competition between two invasive Hydrocharitaceae (Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) (Royle) and Egeria densa (Planch)) as influenced by sediment fertility and season
Competition between two invasive plants of similar growth form, Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) (Royle) and Egeria densa (Planch), was studied in response to season and sediment fertility. These two invasive species were grown in outdoor concrete tanks in monocultures and mixtures. Five fertilization rates were tested for monocultures and two for mixtures where six combinations of planting densities were used in two seasons (spring and fall). Monitoring of plant biomass was made at the end of each of these 2-month-experiments. In contrast to E. densa, clear seasonal patterns in biomass production and in reproductive allocations of H. verticillata were evident. Competitive pressure for both species was lower during the fall experiment. Biomass production increased with fertilization for H. verticillata in monocultures and changes either in allocative ratios or in tuber production patterns were shown in response to nutrient availability. However, E. densa growth was not affected by fertilization. In most cases, H. verticillata was a better competitor than E. densa except when sediment was pure sand. Competition occurred mainly for nutrient uptake rather than for light harvesting. These results suggest that despite the similar ecology, H. verticillata may outcompete E. densa in many situations, probably due to its higher plasticity.
