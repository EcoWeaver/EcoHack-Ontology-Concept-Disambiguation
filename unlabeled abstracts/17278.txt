Plasticity of diel patterns in the diet and habitat use of feral, non-native fathead minnow Pimephales promelas (Actinopterygii, Cyprinidae) in a pond-dwelling population in England
The aim of the study was to test for diel patterns in the diet and habitat use in a feral, pond-dwelling, non-native fathead minnow Pimephales promelas population in England. Fish were collected in June 2009 using traps set in four habitat types (open waters, rushes--Juncus effusus, weeds--Potamogeton natans and mixed vegetation), then sexed and measured for total length and eviscerated weight in the laboratory. Data were analysed at 6-h intervals, with Fulton's condition index and three dietary parameters (frequency of occurrence, number and weight) calculated. Minor diurnal differences in habitat use were observed in males, females and immatures, and these may be due to predator avoidance. Body condition varied greatly in rushes during daytime, probably due to shifts in habitat suitability (e.g. food, refuge). Detritus dominates the diet of native fathead minnow; however, planktonic crustaceans were the most important food resource for this population, with a clear ontogenetic shift, irrespective of habitat, towards greater proportion of ingested detritus in larger individuals. Overall, the results demonstrate that feral fathead minnows display substantial trophic plasticity and a wide range of habitat use, which is normally associated with invasive species. However, established fathead minnow populations in Europe are rare despite its wide-spread ornamental and scientific use.
