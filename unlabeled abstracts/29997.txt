The Biology of Invasive Alien Plants in Canada. 5. Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. & Zucc. [= Fallopia japonica (Houtt.) Ronse Decr.]
Polygonum cuspidatum (Japanese knotweed) is an introduced perennial geophyte in the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae). The phytogeographic distribution of P. cuspidatum in North America suggests a large number of intentional introductions via ornamental plantings from 1870 to 2000, followed by secondary spread from these foci. This species is most pernicious along riparian corridors and road and railroad rights-of-way, reducing visibility, displacing native species, negatively affecting native wildlife, and causing alterations in natural hydrologic processes. Although non-hybrid seed recruitment has not been observed in Europe because of the presence of male-sterile clones only, dispersal of seeds and stem and rhizome fragments by flowing water does occur in North America and populations are readily established from these sources. The primary means of local and regional range expansion is human-mediated transport of rhizome-infested soil. Hybridization is common with the congener P. sachalinense in the introduced ranges of North America and Europe resulting in the equally noxious P. x bohemicum.
