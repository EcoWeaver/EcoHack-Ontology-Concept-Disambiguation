Understanding the Effects of the Invasive Plants on Rural Forest-dependent Communities
Most of the studies on invasive species are disproportionately focused on their ecological effects and more investigations are needed to understand the effects of invasive plants on rural livelihoods. This study assesses the effects of the invasion of Mikania micrantha--an invasive vine--on the livelihoods of the buffer zone community forest users of Chitwan National Park, Nepal. In this study, the invasive plants are categorized based on their life-form (woody and non-woody) and mode of introduction (accidental or deliberate). The focus is on accidentally transported non-woody species. A household survey revealed that the invasion disproportionately affects the livelihoods of forest-dependent households. In addition, the livelihood effects of invasive plants are particularly determined by the suitability of the invasive plants to produce locally important forest products.
