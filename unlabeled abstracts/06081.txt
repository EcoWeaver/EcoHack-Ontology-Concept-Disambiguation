The effects of interference competition on stability, structure and invasion of a multi-species system
An interference competition model for a many species system is presented, based on Lotka-Volterra equations in which some restrictions are imposed on the parameters. The competition coefficients of the Lotka-Volterra equations are assumed to be expressed as products of two factors: the intrinsic interference to other individuals and the defensive ability against such interference. All the equilibrium points of the model are obtained explicitly in terms of its parameters, and these equilibria are classified according to the concept of sector stability. Thus survival or extinction of species at a stable equilibrium point can be determined analytically. The result of the analysis is extended to the successional processes of a community. A criterion for invasion of a new species is obtained and it is also shown that there are some characteristic quantities which show directional changes as succession proceeds.
