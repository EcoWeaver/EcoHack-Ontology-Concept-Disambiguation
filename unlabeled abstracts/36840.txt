Comparative impact of light and neighbor effect on the growth of introduced species Sonneratia apetala and native mangrove species in China: implications for restoration
Light condition and neighbor effects are important environmental factors that need to be considered for restoration of mangroves, especially when introduced species are mixed with native species. To evaluate different mangrove species performance under various light intensities and different planting systems, we selected three native mangrove species (A. marina, Aegiceras corniculatum and Kandelia obovata) and grew them with S. apetala in multi-species plots and in mono-species plots without S. apetala under three light conditions in Futian Nature Reserve, south China. After ten months of the experiment, plant functional traits were measured. The results showed that S. apetala was a light-demanding species and A. corniculatum and A. marina were suitable for growth under the medium light condition. The native species were inhibited by S. apetala. Specifically, the height and basal diameter of the native species were lower in the multi-species plots than in the mono-species plots. In the multi-species plots, native species changed their functional growth traits, with higher specific leaf area and chlorophyll content, and reduced leaf thickness, leaf dry-mass content, and carotenoid content compared to those in the mono-species plots. These results indicated trade-offs between traits that enhance light interception and traits that stimulate plant growth in native species. Our findings revealed that S. apetala is an adequate species with good invasion capability for restoration in open degraded areas, but its ecological impact on the inhibited growth of native species should be carefully considered in mangrove restoration.
