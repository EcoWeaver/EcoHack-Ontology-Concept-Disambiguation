Two species of adventive weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) from Europe, hitherto unrecorded from New Zealand
Two curculionid weevils, Orthochaetes setiger (Beck, 1817) and Exomias pellucidus (Boheman, 1834) are recorded in New Zealand for the first time. The former has a wide distribution through the eastern South Island, while the latter has so far only been located in a single suburban garden in Dunedin. Both species are polyphagous and flightless. Although neither is expected to cause notable economic damage, their potential to invade native ecosystems makes them worthy of further investigation.
