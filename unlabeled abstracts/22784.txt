Alien cyanobacteria Anabaena bergii var. limnetica Coute et Preisig from Lithuania: Some aspects of taxonomy, ecology and distribution
The anthropogenic eutrophication of surface waters and the global climate warming promoted some bloom-forming tropical cyanobacteria, including Anabaena, distribution northwards. Anabaena bergii var. limnetica was for the first time recorded in Lithuania from the hypertrophic Lake Gineitiskes in 2008. It developed when the water temperature reached its annual maximum (July-August); its highest biomass (0.26mgL-1) was reached at the end of July. Akinetes formation started in the middle of August. The morphological variability of A. bergii var. limnetica morphospecies is presented. The morphological, ecological differences and distribution of A. bergii var. limnetica and the related morphospecies A. bergii, A. bergii f. minor, Anabaena minderi are discussed.
