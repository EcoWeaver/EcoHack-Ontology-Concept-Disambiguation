Introducing "Alien Floras and Faunas", a new series in Biological Invasions
The new series launched in this issue of Biological Invasions aims to collect papers that provide information on complete alien floras or faunas of large regions; they can be complete checklists of all alien biota including casual, non-established taxa, or checklists of all naturalized (established) or invasive species occurring in a given region. Authors are invited to submit papers for this series in which they will describe the structure of the studied alien flora or fauna of the target region (for example, in terms of geographic origin, life histories, invaded habitat, time of introduction or introduction pathways), possibly accompanied by an analysis of basic patterns of alien species richness, diversity, or impacts, as well as factors underlying variation in these characteristics.
