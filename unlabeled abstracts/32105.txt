On the establishment of the non-native false limpet Siphonaria pectinata in Tunisia: distribution, population structure and environmental relationships
The aim of this study was to supply new information on the status of the non-native Siphonaria pectinata, recently identified in the Tunisian coasts. Field surveys conducted between 2010 and 2013 across the whole Tunisian coastline ( 1350 km) reveled that among the 25 surveyed stations, S. pectinata has colonized 15 stations covering the entire northern coast from Tabarka to Kelibia ( 300 km). This continuous distribution suggests that its introduction is due to a natural progression from the West, enhanced by the current global warming. Population density and size structure seem to be clearly related to local habitat conditions. The spatial variation of the average density, ranging between 0.10 and 5.34 ind.m-2, was statistically significant. Higher densities were observed at sites marked by strong hydrodynamics and irregular substrate surface. The analysis of the size structure showed that in most stations, limpets rarely exceed 20 mm but reach 28 to 29 mm at sites characterized by moderate wave action, high pollution level and lower densities of potentially competing Patella limpets. The seasonal monitoring of the Tunisian population indicated that recruitment occurs during autumn and winter. Recruits are assumed to have hatched during spring and summer. The similarity between the breeding season of the native Spanish and non-native Tunisian S. pectinata substantiates the western Mediterranean origin of the latter. This study is a first overview of the eco-biology of S. pectinata outside of its original range of distribution. It might serve as a starting point for future monitoring of its interaction with native species and its impact on the functioning of colonized ecosystems.
