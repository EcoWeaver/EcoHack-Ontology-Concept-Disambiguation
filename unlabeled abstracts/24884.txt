Displacement in two invasive species of leafminer fly in different localities
Liriomyza sativae was displaced by L. trifolii in the USA probably due to the lower insecticide susceptibility of L. trifolii, but L. trifolii was displaced by L. sativae in Japan. To know the possible causes of the species displacement observed in Japan, differences in the insecticide susceptibility, fecundity, effects of natural enemies, and reproductive interference between L. trifolii and L. sativae were evaluated. As a result, the higher fecundity of L. sativae and differential effects of parasitoids on the two Liriomyza species are considered to be contributing factors.
