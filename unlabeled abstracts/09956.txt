Two exotic strains of Spalangia drosophilae merit consideration in biological control of Hippelates collusor (Diptera: Chloropidae).
Three strains of Spalangia drosophilae Ashmead, ectoparasitic on Hippelates collusor (Townsend) pupae, from California, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico, are compared for fecundity, longevity, minimum survival temperatures, and ability to reproduce as host densities increase. The California strain demonstrated greatest cold tolerance and highest capability to increase progeny production at high host densities. The Jamaica strain had the greatest fecundity and longevity. Each of the 3 strains showed a significant increase in the production of females with increased host densities. Strains from Puerto Rico and Jamaica had a higher capacity for female production with a single mating. It is suggested that the exotic strains be colonized in southern California for biological control of H. collusor.
