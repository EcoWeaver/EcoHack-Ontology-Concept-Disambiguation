BIOMORPHOLOGY AND TAXONOMIC STATUS OF ADENOCAULON ADHAERESCENS MAXIM. (ASTERACEAE), AN INVASIVE SPECIES IN THE MOSCOW REGION
The results of the study of the only species, which "escaped" from the Main Botanical Garden (MBG RAS, Moscow) and invaded the anthropogenically disturbed territories of the Moscow Region, Adenocaulon adhaerescens Maxim, were summarized. The history of intentional introduction of the species and stages of formation of spontaneous invasive population were described. The characteristic of the plant communities and habitats of the species was given. Data on the population size, seed productivity in the native and the secondary ranges and on vegetative propagation of plants were given. The morphological characters at different stages of plant ontogenesis were described. A comparative analysis of morphometric characters of seeds, leaves, and inflorescences in the native and secondary ranges of the species has been performed. Molecular genetic analysis of A. adhaerescens samples from the natural and secondary ranges and closely related species of the genus Adenocaulon was performed. The analysis has confirmed the validity of A. adhaerescens recognition as a separate species. Diagnostic characters of A. adhaerescens were described. The results of management invasive population in MBG RAS were presented and recommendations on control measures of A. adhaerescens dispersal were given.
