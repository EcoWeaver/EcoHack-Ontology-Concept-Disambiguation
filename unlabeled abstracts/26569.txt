Omobranchus punctatus (Teleostei: Blenniidae), an Exotic Blenny in the Southwestern Atlantic
The muzzled blenny Omobranchus punctatus (Valenciennes), native to the Indo-Pacific region, is recorded in the Southwestern Atlantic coast, inhabiting natural and artificial substrates in the proximities of three large Brazilian seaports (states of Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina). Due to its habitat and habits, the introduction of this species was probably by ship or oil rigs, presumably associated within fouling. It is also argued that the muzzled blenny can maintain populations in natural and artificial (mariculture facilities) coastal environments in the Southwestern Atlantic.
