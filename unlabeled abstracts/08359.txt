The invasive cestode parasite Ligula from salmonids and bullies on the South Island, New Zealand.
Freshwater ecosystems are often impacted by biological invasions, including the introduction of exotic parasites capable of infecting native species. Here, we report the occurrence of the introduced tapeworm Ligula sp. from common bully, Gobiomorphus cotidianus, and quinnat salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, in Lake Hawea, South Island, New Zealand. This parasite has a complex life cycle, reaching its adult stage in fish-eating birds. Worms recovered from the body cavity of fish hosts reached huge sizes (60-300 mm long); however, their low prevalence in fish populations suggests that infections are rare or localised. Molecular analysis (internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1 and ITS2 sequences) confirms that these specimens belong to the genus Ligula and suggests tentative routes of invasion into New Zealand. Monitoring the spread of this parasite is important, as it can impact fish populations and also, when infection levels are high, those of piscivorous birds.
