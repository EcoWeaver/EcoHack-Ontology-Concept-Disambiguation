Controlling sympatric pest mammal populations in New Zealand with self-resetting, toxicant-free traps: a promising tool for invasive species management
The control of invasive mammals is a key challenge for conservation biologists and management practitioners, particularly in locations with a high risk of re-invasion. Here, we tested whether sympatric populations of invasive mammal species could be suppressed simultaneously using self- resetting traps and toxicant-free baits. We used binomial GLM models to examine whether an intermittent pattern of trap checks could be used to predict kill rates under conditions of heavy scavenging. We also estimated the financial costs associated with deployment and maintenance of the multi-kill traps over 10 years, compared with those of aerial and ground-based poisoning methods. Trapping reduced the activity of all target species at the study site to <=10 % within 9 months. Our results show that self-resetting traps are a promising tool for controlling multiple species of pest mammals on an island with a high potential for re-invasion.
