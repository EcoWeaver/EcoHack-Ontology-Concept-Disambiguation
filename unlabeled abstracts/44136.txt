Monitoring and modeling non-native invasive green iguana population response to harvesting on Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands
AbstractRegistered hunters harvested over 1.3 million non-native invasive green iguanas (Iguana iguana) on Grand Cayman between October 2018 and August 2021. We used islandwide post-reproduction survey-based abundance estimates in August 2014-2021 and model-based abundance predictions for August 2022-2030 to assist natural resource managers with reassessment and modification of the harvest strategy due to diminishing returns to hunters paid per green iguana harvested. We need harvest rates > 0.600 for desired abundance <= 50,000 and > 0.700 for desired abundance <= 10,000 green iguanas. With harvest rates < 0.600, the population would likely remain above desired abundance. Without harvesting, the green iguana population would likely reach carrying capacity by August 2026.
