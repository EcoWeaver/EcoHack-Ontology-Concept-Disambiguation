Marine invasion processes: interactions between native and introduced marsh snails
We test two hypotheses to explain the success of a biological invader in marshes on the Pacific coast of North America. The first hypothesis focuses on the competitive superiority of an invading species over native species; the second hypothesis focuses on the absence of ecological equivalents in the aboriginal biota, such that no competitive interactions are necessary to facilitate successful invasion. As a model system we experimentally manipulated the introduced pulmonate snail Ovatella myosotis and the native prosobranch snails Assiminea californica and Littorina subrotundata. Manipulations included pair-wise enclosures to determine of Ovatella depressed the growth of the native;species; pair-wise associations to determine whether or not snails demonstrated negative or positive clustering; removal experiments to see if native snails invaded regions occupied by Ovatella, and reciprocal transplants on a vertical gradient to determine the physiological breath of the target species. In addition to monitoring population abundances of all three species seasonally, dietary overlap of these gastropods was also examined. No evidence of competitive superiority by Ovatella was found. Ovatella possesses the physiological capacities to exist in a semiterrestrial environment and is therefore able to take advantage of resources unavailable to native gastropods. We conclude that the successful establishment of this Atlantic snail in the Pacific Northwest did not arise at the expense of native species.
