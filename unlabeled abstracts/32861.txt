Remotididymella ageratinae sp. nov. and Remotididymella anemophila sp. nov., two novel species isolated from the invasive weed Ageratina adenophora in PR China
To determine if Ageratina adenophora can accumulate diverse pathogens from surrounding native plants, we intensively sampled fungal communities, including endophytes, leaf spot pathogens and canopy air fungi, associated with Ag. adenophora as well as native plants in its invasive range. In total, we collected 4542 foliar fungal strains from 10 geographic sites, including 1340 from healthy leaves of Ag. adenophora , 2051 from leaf spots of Ag. adenophora and 1151 from leaf spots of 56 species of native plants and crops. Taxonomically, the common fungal genera included Colletotrichum , Diaporthe , Alternaria , Nemania , Xylaria , Neofusicoccum , Nigrospora , Epicoccum , Gibberella , Pestalotiopsis , Irpex , Schizophyllum and Clonostachys . We also isolated the cultivable fungi from 12 air samples collected from six areas in Yunnan Province, PR China. Among the total of 1255 air fungal isolates, the most common genera were Cladosporium , Trichoderma and Epicoccum . Among them, two new Remotididymella species, Remotididymella ageratinae from leaf spot of Ag. adenophora and Remotididymella anemophila from canopy air of Ag. adenophora were found. The two species showed both asexual and sexual reproductive structures. The conidia of R. ageratinae and R. anemophila are larger than those of R. anthropophila and R. destructiva . The size of ascospores of R. ageratinae and R. anemophila also differ from R. bauhiniae . Phylogenetic analysis of the combined ITS, LSU rRNA, rpb2 and tub2 sequences showed that R. ageratinae and R. anemophila each formed a distinct clade, separated from all species previously described in Remotididymella and confirmed them as new species belonging to Remotididymella . Full descriptions of R. ageratinae and R. anemophila are provided in this study.
