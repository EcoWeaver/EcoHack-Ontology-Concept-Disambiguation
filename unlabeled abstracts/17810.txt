Public Perception of Invasive Plant Species: Assessing the impact of workshop activities to promote young students' awareness
Invasive species are one of the main threats to biodiversity worldwide. Even though they are identified and recognized as such by the Portuguese law, the majority of the population is not yet aware of this problem. Aiming to increase awareness about biological invasions among young students, a workshop on Invasive Plant Species was organized at the Botanical Museum of the University of Coimbra. A total of 170 teenager students from five schools participated in the workshop. Three activities were prepared, focusing on: (1) identification of invasive plants, (2) competition between native and invasive plants and (3) control of invasive plants. One year later, questionnaires were sent to the participants, aiming to appraise workshop effectiveness, and this questionnaire revealed that these students know more about invasive plant species than a comparable group of students that did not participate in the workshop. The results clearly showed that practical informal education activities may be effective in raising public awareness. Questionnaires were essential to evaluate the knowledge acquired and retained by the students during the workshop.
