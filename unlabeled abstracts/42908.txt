Cultivars of Invasive Japanese Barberry (Berberis thunbergii) Demonstrate Different Reproductive Potential and Seedling Traits
While Japanese barberry ( Berberis thunbergii ) is an acknowledged invasive plant, the danger posed by its garden cultivars is unknown. This work analyzed the reproductive potential and seedling traits of wild type Japanese barberry and four important cultivars: `Atropurpurea', `Aurea', `Crimson Pygmy', and `Rose Glow'. The germination capacity of cleaned and stratified seeds was determined for all accessions in a greenhouse and seedling foliage color was noted. A subpopulation of seedlings from each accession was grown further in containers outdoors for a full season to ascertain seedling vigor. The average number of seeds produced per landscape specimen ranged from 75 and 90 for `Aurea' and `Crimson Pygmy' to 2967 for `Atropurpurea', 726 for `Rose Glow', and 1135 for wild type B. thunbergii . The vigor of 1-year seedlings--as measured by dry weight of top growth--for progeny derived from `Aurea' (2.29 g) and `Crimson Pygmy' (2.74 g) was less than `Atropurpurea' (3.45 g), `Rose Glow' (3.88 g) and wild type (3.73 g). Seedlings derived from purple-leaf cultivars displayed variable ratios of green and purple leaf phenotype correlated to the proximity and identity of likely Japanese barberry pollinators. `Rose Glow' specimens located among other purple-leaf B. thunbergii produced up to 90% purple seedlings, while other samples growing in isolation or near green-leaf plants produced less than 10% purple progeny. This suggests that some invasive green-leaf Japanese barberry could be derived from cultivars. The results also show that these cultivars express disparate reproductive potential.
