First record of greater white-toothed shrewCrocidura russulain Ireland
ABSTRACT * Skeletal remains of greater white-toothed shrew Crocidura russula were recovered from barn owl Tyto alba and kestrel Falco tinnunculus pellets collected at 15 locations in Counties Tipperary and Limerick in Ireland in September 2007 and March 2008. Seven greater white-toothed shrews were trapped at four locations in Tipperary in March 2008. This is the first Irish record of C. russula and compelling evidence that the species is established in Ireland. * The absence of C. russula from earlier surveys of owl pellets and small mammals in Ireland suggests a recent introduction by uncertain means, possibly since 2001. It seems likely that C. russula will expand its range in Ireland. Its impact on the ecology of habitats in which it is found is uncertain but may be considerable.
