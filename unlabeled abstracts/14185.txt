Evaluation of the temporal development of three introduced populations of brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, in Jizerske mountains, Czech Republic
Three populations of brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, established in streams and reservoirs in the Jizersk? Mountains, Czech Republic, were studied between 1995 and 2006. The maximum age was usually 3+ to 4+, but the age 7+ was also recorded. The inflows of all reservoirs are populated mostly by 0+ to 2+ brook trout, while older specimens live in a lentic environment, migrating to lotic habitats only to spawn. The density of brook trout in streams ranged from 8 to 95 individuals per 100 m2 during spring and summer, while that for reservoirs ranged between 31 and 290 individuals per ha. A strong negative correlation between the size of adult fish and population density in reservoirs was observed. The type of management influenced both density and growth of brook trout. Further introduction of this species in the central European area should be restricted to habitats where native salmonids cannot survive, such as acidified waters.
