High regional differentiation in a North American crab species throughout its native range and invaded European waters: a phylogeographic analysis
Rhithropanopeus harrisii (Gould 1841) has a native distribution from New Brunswick (Canada) to Veracruz (Mexico) and is considered an invasive species in northwestern North American (Oregon and California), South American (Brazil) and European estuaries and rivers. In Europe, it was observed for the first time in 1874, in The Netherlands. We sequenced and analyzed part of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (mitochondrial DNA) of eight populations, three from the east coast of the United States of America (USA) and five from Europe, in order to assess their genetic diversity and to determine a potential founder population. European populations are characterized by a lower number of haplotypes than the whole native region of the eastern USA, suggesting that genetic bottlenecks occurred during the European colonisation. Along the North American East Coast, there is evidence of clearcut genetic heterogeneity, New Jersey being the most similar population in its genetic structure to the postulated Europe-founding population. Also the different European populations are heterogeneous and there is a tendency of higher genetic diversity in the populations founded earlier. R. harrisii is still in the process of expansion in Europe and may have been introduced once or repeatedly by different invasion mechanisms. The pronounced lack of gene flow among populations is of great ecological significance, since it may facilitate rapid adaptation and specialization to local conditions within single estuarine systems.
