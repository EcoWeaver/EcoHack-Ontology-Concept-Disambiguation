Current status of Brazilian scientific production on non-native species
Non-native species pose a great risk to native biodiversity and emergency action on them requires much study on species biology, survival, and invasion strategies. In this research, we seek to analyze articles published on the Web Of Science platform, using as keywords: ("introduced species" OR "exotic species" OR "non-native species" OR "alien species" OR "invasive species") AND Brazil*) to identify the current state of the problem of non-native species in Brazil. 1490 records were found, suggesting that Brazil has shown a gradual growth in publications on non-native species with considerable growth in publications since the year 2000, but there are differences between regions. It was possible to significantly differentiate the groups with the greatest scientific production (South and Southeast) where the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado Biomes are located, as well as the institutions that most publish. The main groups of species addressed in the articles were plants, fish and insects. The information compiled reinforces the importance of more research on species invasion, we suggest that incentives and partnerships between research groups in Brazilian regions be established, so that there is a homogeneous increase in publications, and encourage the creation of projects aimed at controlling or eradicating introduced species.
