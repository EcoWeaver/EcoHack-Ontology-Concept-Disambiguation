Potential spread of Great Lakes fishes given climate change and proposed dams: an approach using circuit theory to evaluate invasion risk
The Great Lakes currently harbour a number of non-native fishes that are thermally limited to the comparatively warm waters of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.Climate change could facilitate the inland spread of many non-native species as the Great Lakes and their tributaries warm, putting thousands of inland lakes and streams at risk. We investigated how watershed network configurations, climate change and proposed hydropower development could influence invasion risk in the Great Lakes Basin. Electric circuit theory was used to model hydrologic accessibility of aquatic ecological networks (i.e., lake, river, and impoundment chains) within tertiary watersheds. Risk of invasion was measured as the product of probability of non-native species spread (hydrologic accessibility) and amount of suitable thermal habitat under an ensemble of air temperature projections. Proposed hydro-power dam sites and their upstream catchments were used to evaluate changes in total risk of invasion given passable, semi-passable, and impassable dams.We showthat projected climate change will lead to more coolwater stream and warmwater lake habitat. Overall invasion risk of cool- and warmwater species was highest in southern Ontario and surprisingly in northern watersheds draining into Lake Superior. This risk could be partially mediated by proposed dams if dams reduce connectivity and access to potentially suitable habitat. Our evaluation of mean invasion risk provides a broad-scale comparative tool for management of invasive species control options.
