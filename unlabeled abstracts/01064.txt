Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus: a most successful invasive tick species in West-Africa
The cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is known to be a highly reproductive and efficient vector of Babesia bovis, two characters which make this tick a threat to livestock keeping in many continents. The authors identified this tick in Ivory Coast, West Africa, in 2007, and hypothesized the spread to be minimal, as this tick was not observed in previous years. To determine the extent of its distribution and to a lesser extent the possible impact of the tick on the livelihoods of Ivorian smallholders, a cross-sectional survey was carried out in the Abidjan and Agboville Departments of Ivory Coast, in April 2008. The results of the study reveal that the newly introduced tick has almost completely displaced all indigenous Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) species in the study area and gave rise to unsuccessful tick control, inappropriate pesticide use, loss of milk production and even increased mortality in dairy cattle.
