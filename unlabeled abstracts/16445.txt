Admixture of two phylogeographic lineages of the Eurasian beaver in Poland
The Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) represents an uncommon example of an endangered species in which the restoration programs proved a spectacular success and led to enormous spatial and demographic expansion. Documented reintroduction of beavers in Poland have been conducted using animals of the eastern European origin, most likely derived from the eastern mtDNA lineage. However demographic and spatial expansion of beavers from Germany, which represent the western lineage, may have led to admixture of these two genetically distinct entities in Poland. We detected significant genetic differentiation between the populations from W and NE Poland both in mitochondrial DNA control region and microsatellites, but also substantial admixture including apparent first-generation migrants between regions. Our results indicate that beavers from the western mtDNA lineage have contributed considerably to the Polish population, particularly in W Poland. As there have been no adequately documented translocations of beavers from the western European populations to Poland, the observed situation appears to result from natural migration or range expansion from the west. In contrast to previous findings we detected a substantial diversity in mtDNA control region, which indicates that either the variation in relict populations has been underestimated, or that additional relict beaver populations survived at the end of the 19th century in Poland and Germany as indicated by considerable similarity of ancient and extant mtDNA haplotypes. The implications of our findings for beaver conservation and management are discussed.
