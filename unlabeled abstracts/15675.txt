Floristic and phytocoenological research of segetal plant communities in cultivated areas of southern Srem
Segetal vegetation was studied in the cultivated areas of southern Srem with the aim of analyzing its taxonomy, phytocoenology, syntaxonomy and phytogeography, as well as determining to what extent ecological factors influenced the differentiation of segetal plant communities among row crops, small grain crops and in alfalfa fields. Segetal flora was comprised of 124 plant species, classified into 38 families, of which Asteraceae (28), Fabaceae (10) and Poaceae (10) contained the greatest number of species. Three associations were selected based on phytocoenological analysis: Polygonetum convolvulo-avicularis, Consolido-Polygonetum avicularis and Lolio-Plantaginetum majoris, as well as five lower syntaxa (subassociations and facies). Crop type, moisture, habitat acidity (pH), temperature and anthropogenic factors had the greatest impact on the ecological differentiation of the studied vegetation. The significant presence of non-native species (18) was another consequence of the anthropogenic effects and geographic position of southern Srem, and these, as coenobionts of segetal plant communities and undesirable species, had a significant impact on crop yield.
