Biological performance ofDiclidophlebia smithi(Hemiptera: Psyllidae), a potential biocontrol agent for the invasive weedMiconia calvescens
Diclidophlebia smithi Burckhardt, Morais and Picanc,o (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) is a promising biological control agent of Miconia calvescens DC. (Melastomataceae), a neotropical invasive weed in forest ecosystems in French Polynesia and Hawaii and a threat in Australia, where it was also introduced. A study on the reproductive performance of D. smithi under laboratory conditions through life expectancy and fertility tables is presented. Results indicated that this psyllid has a high reproductive capacity (R01 and rm0) and a short life cycle (4647 days) and can have up to nine generations per year. The critical period of its life cycle is during the nymphal stage which is clearly inadequate for field introductions. The best age for introducing D. smithi against M. calvescens is the 4th day of the adult stage. D. smithi is easily mass-reared and has a short life cycle and a high reproductive capacity, which are desirable characteristics for a biological control agent.
