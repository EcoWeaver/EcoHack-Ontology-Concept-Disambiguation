Effects of Root Exudates from Invasive Plant (Mirabilis jalapa) on Soil Microenviroment under Different Land-Use Types
Mirabilis jalapa seedlings were cultured in hydroponics, root exudates (RE) were collected by concentrating the deionized water, in which the M. jalapa seedlings transferring to. Collected root exudates were subjected to the soil with winter wheat cultivation and wasteland. Soil available nutrition contents, enzyme activities and microorganism population were determined. The results showed that the root exudates of M. jalapa could significantly reduce the contents of the available K, available N and P in soil under the higher input. But higher input of M. jalapa root exudates significantly improved ( P<0.05) the organic matter in soil. The exudates could reduce the soil enzyme activities except for protease, and which was elevating along with the raising input. The difference was significant when the input of root exudates was middle level. But higher input of M. jalapa root exudates significantly enhanced ( P<0.05) the activity of protease in soil. The amount of bacteria and actinomycetes in treatment LC and HC showed an evident reduction in the population of living microorganisms. However, the population of fungi increased under treatment LC and MC, which was almost twice as much as that in corresponding control when the root exudates was middle concentration. But the fungi population in treatment HC was significantly lower than that in corresponding control. Conclusively, the root exudates of M. jalapa imposed a prominent influence on soil micro-ecology environment in wheat field and wasteland.
