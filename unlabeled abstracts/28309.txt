Defense Response of Native and Alien Mealybugs (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) Against the Solitary Parasitoid Anagyrus sp. nr. pseudococci (Girault) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae)
The host behavioral and immune (encapsulation) defenses against the parasitoid Anagyrus sp. nr. pseudococci were compared for five mealybug species with different phylogenetic relationships and geographical origins: i) a Mediterranean native mealybug species, Planococcus ficus, with a long co-evolutionary history with the parasitoid; ii) three alien mealybugs species, Planococcus citri, Pseudococcus calceolariae and Pseudococcus viburni, with a more recent co-evolutionary history; and iii) a fourth alien mealybug species, Phenacoccus peruvianus, with no previous common history with the parasitoid. Three host defense behaviors were registered: abdominal flipping, reflex bleeding and walking away. The native host Pl. ficus and its congener Pl. citri exhibited the lowest probability of defense behavior (0.11+-0.01 and 0.09+-0.01 respectively), whereas the highest value was observed in P. viburni (0.31+- 0.02). Intermediate levels of defense behavior were registered for Ps. calceolariae, and Ph. peruvianus. The probability of parasitoid encapsulation was lowest and highest for two alien host species, Ph. peruvianus (0.20+-0.07) and Ps. viburni (0.86+-0.05), respectively. The native host Pl. ficus, its congener Pl. citri and Ps. calceolariae showed intermediate values (0.43+-0.07, 0.52+-0.06, and 0.45+-0.09, respectively). The results are relevant with respect to biological control and to understand possible evolutionary processes involved in host range of A. sp. nr. pseudococci.
