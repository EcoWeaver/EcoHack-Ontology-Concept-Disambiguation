Diet and feeding ecology of invasive icefish Neosalanx taihuensis in Erhai Lake, a Chinese plateau mesoeutrophicated lake
A comprehensive study of the invasive icefish Neosalanx taihuensis feeding ecology in Erhai Lake was conducted from November 2009 to October 2010. Prey items in the guts of the icefish sampled varied significantly according to season. This finding suggests a relationship between fluctuations in available prey in the environment and selective feeding by icefish. N. taihuensis preferred large-sized zooplankton, such as Daphnia and calanoids. Additionally, the gut fullness values differed significantly (PN. taihuensis zooplankton consumption varied significantly, both diurnally and among seasons. The daily consumption values ranged from 0.089 to 0.237 g (wet weight) per 100 g wet fish weight in temperatures between 11.50degC and 24.68degC. This is the first report of diel feeding periodicity and daily food consumption of icefish in their invaded ecosystems.
