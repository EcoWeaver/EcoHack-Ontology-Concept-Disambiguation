Factors responsible for the distribution of invasive plant species in the surroundings of railway areas. A case study from SE Poland
Invasive plant species are a growing concern in global biodiversity management. In this study, we tried to determine whether invasive plants could spread from railway track into the surrounding areas and focused on the factors responsible for the invasive plant species composition, richness, and abundance. We sampled invasive species along transects located outside a railway route and recorded the invasive species richness and abundance at a distance of < 5 (control), 5-10, 10-15, and > 15 m away from the railway edge in three geographical regions in SE Poland. We revealed that the mechanism allowing alien species to invade was complex. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) explained 30.9% of variance. On a regional scale, the invasive flora composition in the surroundings of railway habitats was determined by abiotic environment diversity (mean annual air temperature, mean annual precipitation), but not habitat-related factors (soil type, soil properties). On a spatial scale, the traffic volume, the distance from the railway area, the distance from build-up areas, and the interaction of these factors affect the invasive species composition away from railway areas. The invasive species spread from railways to the surrounding vegetation, therefore, regular monitoring of railway areas should be a framework for assessing the risk of invasive species.
