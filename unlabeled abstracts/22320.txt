Revegetation of ski runs in Serbia: Case studies of Mts. Stara Planina and Divcibare
Revegetation is the most sustainable method of soil stabilization at ski runs. In order to establish a stable plant community, it is recommended to use native species. However, non-native species are most often used. In this paper the revegetation of ski runs at two ski resorts is investigated: Divcibare and Stara Planina. Seven species were used for the revegetation of the ski run at the Divcibare ski resort of which six species were native. Six species were used for the revegetation of the Stara Planina ski resort, of which two species were native. It was established that the plant species used in the seed mixtures were suitable for erosion control at the investigated ski resorts.
