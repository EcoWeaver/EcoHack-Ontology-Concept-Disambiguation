First record of Pinctada imbricata Roding, 1798 (Bivalvia: Pteroidea) attached to a rafting item: a potentially invasive species on the Uruguayan coast
Here we describe a record of the occurrence of juveniles of the bivalve Pinctada imbricata Roding, 1798 attached to a floating rope on the Urugyuayan coast. This new record, rather a simple new southernmost occurrence, represents the first example of early stage invasive species (stage I), which could eventually be allowed to settle in a southernmost region.
