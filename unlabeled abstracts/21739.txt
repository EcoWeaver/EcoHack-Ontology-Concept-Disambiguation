Macrobenthic assemblages of newly introduced Caulerpa taxifolia from the Eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey
Caulerpa taxifolia is one of the most important and best-studied alien species in the Mediterranean Sea. The present study reveals the macrobenthic assemblages associated with C. taxifolia from the region. We found 26 species from Polychaeta, 31 species from Crustacea, 22 species from Mollusca and 5 species from Echinodermata. In conclusion, C. taxifolia in Iskenderun Bay can be considered an ecosystem engineer that modifies local habitats and also enhances biodiversity.
