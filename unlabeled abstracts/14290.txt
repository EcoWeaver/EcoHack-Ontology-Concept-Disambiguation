South Africa - A global player in the battle against alien plant invasions
The 4th International Symposium on Weeds and Invasive Plants was held in Montpellier, France, from 19 to 23 May 2014. Hosted by the European Weed Research Society, the symposium was attended by 152 delegates from 33 countries (including South Africa). The Society provided financial support to several delegates (including the author) to facilitate their attendance. Initiated in 2006 and held every 3 years in a European country, this symposium has in the past highlighted important subjects such as ragweed management and how society deals with invasive species. The 2014 meeting focused mainly on the management of invasive plants and aimed to strengthen global interactions and to facilitate exchanges to bridge the gap between the science (researchers) and the action on the ground (managers and action agencies in the field). For example, an extra session offered during one of the evenings - on the establishment of global biocontrol research centres and the maintenance of effective global collaborations in this field - was aimed at ensuring an unobstructed flow of biocontrol agents between 'donating' and 'receiving' countries.
