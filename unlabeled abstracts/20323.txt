Stingers in a strange land: South American freshwater stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) in Singapore
South American freshwater stingrays of the family Potamotrygonidae have long been popular worldwide as ornamentals in the aquarium trade. Despite this, there have so far not been any reported cases of their establishment elsewhere in the world. Here, we document the ocellate river stingray, Potamotrygon motoro, as having established itself in Singapore. This represents the first alien record of a South American freshwater stingray outside the Neotropics. Keywords Potamotrygon -Aquarium trade-Reservoir-Aquatic invasive species
