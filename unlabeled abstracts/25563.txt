A decision framework for natural resource management: a case study using plant introductions
One means of anticipating and, thus, preventing natural resource problems, such as those that may arise from plant introductions, is to use effective decision frameworks. This paper argues that such frameworks are typified by 4 elements. These are clear goals explicitly linked to cultural values, key questions that scope problems and management options, application of appropriate analytical tools, and the connection of authority for decisions with responsibility for outcomes. These elements are explored here. Trade offs are an inevitable part of decisions concerning natural resource management, including those relating to plant introductions. Benefit-cost and multicriteria decision analyses are useful in this regard, but must be applied using methods that ensure all the relevant cultural values and management options are explored. Some recent proposals concerning the assessment of plant introductions do not always adequately frame decision issues. Ecological risk assessments can be used to define an acceptable level of risk concerning the negative impacts of introducing new biota, and, combined with an appropriate benefit-cost or multi-criteria analysis, provide the suite of analytical tools to make effective decisions concerning plant introductions. Effective decisions are more likely when the authority to make decisions and the responsibility for unforeseen outcomes are closely linked.
