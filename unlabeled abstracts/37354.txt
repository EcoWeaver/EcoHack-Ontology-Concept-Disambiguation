The Amazon sailfin catfish Pterygoplichthys pardalis (Siluriformes: Loricariidae), a new exotic species established in the Dominican Republic
The correct identity and occurrence of the introduced armored catfish, locally known as "devil fish" or "pleco" in the Dominican Republic, is briefly described. Specimens were collected from six sites in the Dominican Republic. Several meristic and morphometric characters, as well as other external features including coloration, were examined. Results were compared with existing literature on fishes of the family Loricariidae. Examination revealed that specimens of the armored catfish, unofficially reported as Hypostomus plecostomus, actually belongs to the species Pterygoplichthys pardalis (Castelnau, 1855). It is inferred that this fish is established in Dominican inland waters, also the possibe occurrence of more than one species of Pterygoplichthys is discussed. This is the first report of this invasive species in the island of Hispaniola.
