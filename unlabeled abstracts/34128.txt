The fish itself, not only environment, should be considered in studying invasion success
A recent article in EFF (Konecna et al. 2014) focuses on one of several theories explaining success of introduced species, namely the theory of alternative ontogenies and invasive potential (Kovac 2010; Zahorska et al. 2013). This theory (henceforth AOIP) postulates that regardless of concrete ecological factors, the invasive population has to cope with an unknown environment never experienced in the species' evolutionary history, and the success of such a population depends on its capability to generate phenotypes with more generalised life-history traits (LHT), often substantially different from those of the native population. The wider the spread between the most generalised and the most specialised phenotypes that a species can generate, the greater its invasive potential can be (Kovac 2010). Variation of LHT can be explained by classic ecological theory related to r and K-selection (Charlesworth 1971; Roughgarden 1971) or in terms of the life-history theory (Winemiller 1989; Winemiller & Rose 1992) as bet hedging for more numerous offspring. Nevertheless, AOIP provides a complementary insight at the same phenomenon, as it combines developmental biology with ecology. Here, I comment on several issues of the study by Konecna et al. (2014).
