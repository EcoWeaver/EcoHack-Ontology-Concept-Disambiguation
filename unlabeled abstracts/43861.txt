Invasive chameleons released from predation display more conspicuous colors
Conspicuous social and sexual signals are predicted to experience pronounced character release when natural selection via predation is relaxed. However, we have few good examples of this phenomenon in the wild and none in species with dynamic color change. Here, we show that Jackson's chameleons inadvertently introduced from Kenya to Hawaii (Oahu), where there are no coevolved, native lizard predators, experienced pronounced character release of color signals. Hawaiian chameleons displayed more conspicuous social color signals than Kenyan chameleons during male contests and courtship, were less cryptic in response to bird and snake predators, and showed greater change between display and antipredator color states. Hawaiian chameleon display colors were also more conspicuous in their local than ancestral habitats, consistent with local adaptation of social signals. These results demonstrate that relaxed predation pressure can result in character release of dynamic social signals in introduced species experiencing strong sexual selection.
