Insights and controversies into the role of the key apicomplexan invasion ligand, Apical Membrane Antigen 1.
Apicomplexan parasites are obligate intracellular pathogens that cause a host of human and animal diseases. These parasites have developed a universal mechanism of invasion involving formation of a 'moving junction' that provides a stable anchoring point through which the parasite invades host cells. The composition of the moving junction, particularly the presence of the protein Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1), has recently been the subject of some controversy. In this commentary we review findings that led to the current model of the moving junction complex and dissect the major conflicts to determine whether a substantial reassessment of the role of AMA1 is justified.
