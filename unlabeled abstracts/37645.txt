Establishment of the exotic parasiteTetrastichus haitiensis [Hym.: Eulophidae] and recovery of a newTrichogramma [Hym.: Trichogrammatidae] from root weevil egg masses in Florida
The exotic root weevil egg parasite,Tetrastichus haitiensis Gahan, imported from Puerto Rico and released in Florida between 1969 and 1971, was found established on citrus root weevil egg masses in 1978 near Oakhill, Florida. It was also recovered there from field-collected weevil egg masses from June to August 1978 and from citrus bouquets containing egg masses placed in the grove during July and August 1978. In addition, a new species ofTrichogramma was discovered. In the laboratory, this species parasitized egg masses of 4 species of weevils that attack citrus in Florida. These areDiaprepes abbreviatus (L.),Pachnaeus litus (Germar),P. opalus (Olivier) andArtipus floridanus Horn.
