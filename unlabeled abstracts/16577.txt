Cacopsylla biwa sp. nov. (Hemiptera: Psyllidae): a new pest of loquat Eriobotrya japonica (Rosaceae) in Japan
A new psyllid species, Cacopsylla biwa Inoue, sp. nov., is described from Tokushima Prefecture, Shikoku, Japan. This new species develops only on Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl. (Rosaceae), causing severe damage to its fruits and flowers. It is strongly suspected that C. biwa is an alien species. Morphological similarities and host-plant relationships indicate that C. biwa is most closely related to Cacopsylla eriobotryae (Yang) comb. nov. (transferred from Edentatipsylla Li), which occurs in Taiwan and feeds on Eriobotrya deflexa (Hemsl.) Nakai. Morphological diagnostic characteristics of C. biwa and differences from the other congeners are discussed. Information is provided on the biology and life cycle of the new species.
