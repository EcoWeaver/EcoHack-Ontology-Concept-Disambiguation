Observations on Radopholus bridgei Siddiqi & Hahn, 1995 intercepted in exotic aquarium plants imported to Poland
Abstract Radopholus bridgei was intercepted in water-inhabiting plants (Anubias sp., Echinodores sp., Ophiopogon sp.) imported to Poland from southeast Asia. This is only the second time that the species has been found and the first time that it has been reported in Europe. Because of its potential quarantine significance (Radopholus species are known to be highly polyphagous) the nematode is described and illustrated, thereby providing supplementary data to the original description. It was found that the 'rod-like' shape of the sperm in Radopholus (as often reported in the literature) is actually due to viewing the lens-shaped sperm cells in lateral aspect. This is a significant observation as sperm shape (rod-like or rounded) has been used as a taxonomic character. The potential of R. bridgei as a quarantine pest is currently unclear and its threat status needs to be studied.
