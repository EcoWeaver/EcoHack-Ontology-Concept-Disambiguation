Mapping an invasive species, kudzu (Pueraria montana), using hyperspectral imagery in western Georgia
Invasive plant species are causing severe environmental and ecological impacts. This study utilized airborne hyperspectral image data and digital image processing techniques to map one of the most aggressive weeds, kudzu ( Pueraria montana), in western Georgia. Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transform followed by Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) produced the best map results among several other procedures. Validation with field data show that this procedure delivered user's accuracy of 83.02% for kudzu-invaded plots and 95.90% for non-invaded plots, with Producer's accuracy of 73.26% and 82.47%, respectively. Further analysis using a GIS-based CART analysis indicates the importance of elevation in limiting the spatial distribution of kudzu.
