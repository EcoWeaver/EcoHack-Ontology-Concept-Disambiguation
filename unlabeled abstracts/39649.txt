Evolutionary response of a native butterfly to concurrent plant invasions: Simulation of population dynamics
The habitat of the green-veined white butterfly Pieris oleracea in eastern North America has undergone invasions by the exotic plant garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), which is replacing native hosts of P. oleracea such as Cardamine diphylla. A. petiolata was originally lethal to most larvae of the native butterfly but during the past 20+ years it has been incorporated successfully into the larval diet, likely through evolutionary change. The region was also invaded by another exotic plant, Cardamine pratensis, on which the native butterfly larvae readily develops, allowing the possibility of population rescue. Further complicating the butterfly's reproductive dynamics, it is multigenerational within a summer, and host plant availability and location change during the summer. Our goal is to model the expected dynamics of the native butterfly population in this evolving, dynamic landscape by using a new bio-inspired paradigm known as membrane computing.
