Design and evaluation of a hybrid sensor network for cane toad monitoring
This article investigates a wireless acoustic sensor network application--monitoring amphibian populations in the monsoonal woodlands of northern Australia. Our goal is to use automatic recognition of animal vocalizations to census the populations of native frogs and the invasive introduced species, the cane toad. This is a challenging application because it requires high frequency acoustic sampling, complex signal processing, wide area sensing coverage and long-lived unattended operation. We set up two prototypes of wireless sensor networks that recognize vocalizations of up to ninth frog species found in northern Australia. Our first prototype consists of only resource-rich Stargate devices. Our second prototype is more complex and consists of a hybrid mixture of Stargates and inexpensive, resource-poor Mica2 devices operating in concert. In the hybrid system, the Mica2s are used to collect acoustic samples, and expand the sensor network coverage. The Stargates are used for resource-intensive tasks such as fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) and machine learning. The hybrid system incorporates four algorithms designed to account for the sampling, processing, energy, and communication bottlenecks of the Mica2s (1) high frequency sampling, (2) thresholding and noise reduction, to reduce data transmission by up to 90%, (3) sampling scheduling, which exploits the sensor network redundancy to increase the effective sample processing rate, and (4) harvesting-aware energy management, which exploits sensor energy harvesting capabilities to extend the system lifetime. Our evaluation shows the performance of our systems over a range of scenarios, and demonstrate that the feasibility and benefits of a hybrid systems approach justify the additional system complexity.
