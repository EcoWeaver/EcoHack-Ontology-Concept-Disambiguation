Cnidoscolus (Euphorbiaceae) escaped in Malesia?
The genus Cnidoscolus, a species rich genus in the Americas, has been introduced in the Philippines. A cultivar of Cnidoscolus aconitifolius is used as vegetable and has been collected from gardens in Manila and Pasay City and two times near Cebu City. It cannot be excluded that it has escaped cultivation there, but the species does not appear to be invasive.
