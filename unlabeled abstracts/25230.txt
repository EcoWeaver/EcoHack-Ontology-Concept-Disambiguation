On the finding of round goby Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas) (Gobiidae) in the food of burbot Lota lota (L.) of the Rybinskoe water reservoir
The fish swallowed by the burbot caught with gill nets in the Volzhskii reach of the Rybinskoe water reservoir in 2007 are investigated. Based on the teretial body shape, the absence of a swim bladder, the presence of a pelvic disc, the dimensions of the skull, the body length, the body weight, and the age, the specimens found in the gut of the burbot are identified as round goby Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas). The round goby should be regarded as an adventive (invasive) species because it is not distributed in different biotopes of the Rybinskoe water reservoir.
