Statistical models for monitoring and predicting effects of climate change and invasion on the free-living insects and a spider from sub-Antarctic Heard Island
Terrestrial ecosystems of sub-Antarctic islands are particularly sensitive to global and local human impacts, including climate change and species invasion. Invertebrates form a central component of these ecosystems. We conducted a stratified survey of 60 sites on sub-Antarctic Heard Island and used Poisson regression models to describe the spatial distribution and abundance of five of the ten free-living species captured. Acari and Collembola were not considered. Five species were not caught in traps in sufficient numbers to model. The distributions of species were described by altitude, vegetation type and aspect. The resulting distribution models can be used to both monitor and predict the effects of climate change and species invasion on this unique and valuable ecosystem.
