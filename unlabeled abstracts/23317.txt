Mixed messages from multiple information sources on invasive species: a case of too much of a good thing?
Aim The increasing number and availability of online databases of alien species beg a question of their comparability given most do not adopt standard criteria in the definition of species status or taxonomic treatment and vary in their comprehensiveness. In this study, we compare the consistency of two major European databases for the regions they have in common. We assess whether they use consistent terminology to classify species status, provide similar taxonomic classification and coverage, deliver comparable estimates of alien richness per country and identify comparable correlates of alien richness.
