Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi improve the growth and disease resistance of the invasive plant Wedelia trilobata
Aims: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are symbiotic partners of many invasive plants, however it is still unclear how AMF contribute to traits that are important for the successful invasion of their host and how environmental factors, such as nutrient conditions, influence this. This study was to explore the effects of Glomus versiforme (GV) and Glomus mosseae (GM) on the growth and disease resistance of the invasive plant Wedelia trilobata under different nutrient conditions. Methods and results: We found that GV and GM had higher root colonization rates resulting in faster W. trilobata growth under both low-N and low-P nutrient conditions compared to the normal condition. Also, the colonization of W. trilobata by GV significantly reduced the infection area of the pathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani under low-N conditions. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that AMF can promote the growth and pathogenic defense of W. trilobata in a nutrient-poor environment, which might contribute to their successful invasion into certain type of habitats. Significance and impact of the study: In this study, we report for the first time that AMF can promote growth and disease resistance of W. trilobata under nutrient-poor environment, which contribute to a better understanding of plant invasion.
