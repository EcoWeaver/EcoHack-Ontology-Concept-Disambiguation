Distribution of Eunicidae (Annelida: Polychaeta) along the Levantine coast of Turkey, with special emphasis on alien species
Distributional features of Eunicidae (Annelida, Polychaeta) along the Levantine coast of Turkey were assessed based on data derived from qualitative and quantitative samples collected in various substrata, habitat and depths (0-100 m). The examined material contained 12 species and 4644 individuals belonging to five genera (Eunice, Leodice, Lysidice, Marphysa and Palola). Marphysa was represented by the highest number of species and Lysidice by the highest number of individuals in the area. The dominant species were Lysidice ninetta, L. margaritacea and Leodice antennata; the most frequent species were Leodice antennata, Lysidice ninetta and L. unicornis among the stations. The Lessepsian migrants, Leodice antennata and Palola valida, seem to have been well established and formed dense populations (max. 725 and 100 ind.m , respectively) in the area. The distribution of L. antennata seems to be related to the total inorganic nitrogen and silica concentrations in the water column. The ratio between alien and native species' abundances increased from the western to the eastern parts of the region.
