A systematization of information on Brazilian Federal protected areas with management actions for Animal Invasive Alien Species
Invasive alien species (IAS) threaten the stability of natural ecosystems and the persistence of several native species. Despite the known occurrence of animal IAS in Brazilian Protected Areas, the lack of systematized information impairs the planning, implementation and improvement of control actions. We identified, listed and evaluated animal invasive alien species control/management actions in federal Brazilian protected areas by reviewing protected areas management plans and applying online questionnaires to protected areas managers. The majority (85%) of the 68 Management Plans that identified the occurrence animal invasive alien species inside the protected areas had only very generic control recommendations. Among 116 respondent managers, 48% declared to perform some invasive alien species management/control actions, which are mainly physical control efforts, due convenience and not necessarily effectiveness of such actions. We point out the need for better integrated management planning and actions in order to control animal IAS in federal Brazilian protected areas.
