Acroptilon repens, an Asian invader, has stronger competitive effects on species from America than species from its native range
The ability to competitively suppress native species is key to successful invasion. Since invasions involve an increase in abundance or dominance of a species in its non-native range, competitive effects might be expected to be stronger in the non-native range of an invader; however, there have been few comparisons of the competitive effects of invasive plants on species from invaded ranges versus species from native ranges. We compared the competitive and allelopathic effects of Acroptilon repens on native North American species to effects on related species from the native range of Acroptilon in Uzbekistan. We also compared the competitive interactions among these North American and Eurasian species, in the absence of Acroptilon, examining the hypothesis that particular regional species pools may show differences in competitive ability. The results showed that Acroptilon had stronger competitive effects against native North American species than against species native to Uzbekistan. There was no difference in the competitive effects among Eurasians and North Americans. The effects of leachates collected from Acroptilon roots were weak but more negative on species from North America than on species from Uzbekistan. Our results suggest that inherently stronger competitive and allelopathic effects of Acroptilon on North American plants than on plants from its native range may contribute to its invasive success.
