Naturalization of landscaping woody plant, Magnolia obovata potentially invasive species
Magnolia obovata, a tree species native to Japan, is a traditional landscaping tree that has also been introduced to various countries. M. obovata individuals have recently emerged in non-planting areas in Korea, prompting us to investigate its distribution by establishing Dosolsan in an urban forest of Daejeon City as the target site. In order to determine its naturalization, the study explored the status of population growth by examining the diameter at breast height of the individuals, and diameter diminution quotient was calculated. Cores of the trees were collected, and the age distribution was estimated by regression analysis. Reproduction possibility was analyzed by verifying the flower-blooming and fruit-bearing. Spontaneous colonization was investigated in the other potential sites which have different location and environment, respectively. The diameter distribution showed a reverse J-shaped curve, and the diminution quotient was 1.8. The population was composed of different generations, thus confirming the growth of the population. The distributed M. obovata grew and flowered normally, and followed a normal life cycle. The same phenomenon was observed in other planting areas, residual forests in urban or rural areas, alluvial islands, and mountain forests. The continuous spread of M. obovata in new ecosystems may be attributable to its long-term distribution by birds, relatively fast growth, and maturity time. Investigations on the naturalization and spread of M. obovata in Korea, as well as in various countries, are warranted.
