Mosquito surveillance and the first record of morphological and molecular-based identification of invasive species Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae), southern Iran
Ae. aegypti is an important vector for transmission of some dangerous arboviral diseases, including Dengue Fever. The present study was conducted (from August 2017 to January 2020) to survey the fauna of Culicine mosquitoes, emphasizing the existence of this invasive species in oriental parts of the country located near the Persian Gulf. Different sampling methods were used to collect all life stages of the mosquito. After morphological identification, a molecular study based on Cytochrome Oxidase (COI) gene-specific primers was performed. Then, the COI gene was sequenced via the Sanger method. A total of 4843 adults and 11,873 larvae were collected (8 species of Culex, one species of Culiseta, and 5 species of Aedes). Fifty-five Ae. aegypti specimens (8 adults and 47 larvae) were identified.Based on the biology and ecological requirements of Ae. aegypti, the possibility of the permanent establishment of this species in the tropical climate of the region is very likely. Considering the detection of this invasive vector mosquito species in Iran and the high incidence of some arboviral diseases in the neighboring countries, and continuous movements of the settlers of these areas, potential outbreaks of arboviral diseases can be predicted. Planning and implementing an immediate surveillance and control program of the vector mosquito is vital to prevent the permanent establishment of this invasive vector mosquito species in southern Iran.
