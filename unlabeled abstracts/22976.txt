Regeneration and Colonization of an Invasive Macrophyte Grass in Response to Desiccation
The emergent macrophyte Urochloa subquadripara, an exotic and invasive species, causes extensive damage to aquatic plant assemblages. Regeneration and colonization by fragments of U. subquadripara may be affected by desiccation and may differ according to the fragment portion (apical, intermediate or basal). We tested the hypotheses that the ability of U. subquadripara fragments to regenerate and colonize declines with increasing time of exposure to desiccation, and that apical portions regenerate and colonize more quickly than intermediate and basal ones. Apical, intermediate and basal portions were exposed to different desiccation periods and left to grow in a greenhouse. Sprout and root growth were negatively and significantly affected by the desiccation period; fragments exposed to intermediate levels of desiccation regenerated and colonized the sediment at rates similar to those of the control. In addition, apical fragments showed greater development and sediment colonization than intermediate and basal fragments. Thus, the data supported our two hypotheses. Our results show that U. subquadripara has a high regeneration potential, indicating that the use of water drawdown to control its spread may be ineffective, and new strategies are required.
