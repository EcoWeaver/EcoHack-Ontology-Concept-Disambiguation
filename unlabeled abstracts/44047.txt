First record of native species of sponge overgrowing invasive corals Tubastraea coccinea and Tubastraea tagusensis in Brazil
Desmapsamma anchorata has been recorded overgrowing Tubastraea coccinea and Tubastraea tagusensis on two sites at Ilha Grande, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The records of D. anchorata overgrowing and killing T. coccinea and T. tagusensis showed that this native sponge could be an important competitor for the invasive corals.
