A role for thermoregulation in the Polistes dominulus invasion: a comparison of the thermoregulatory abilities of the invasive wasp P. dominulus and the native wasp P. fuscatus
Social insects are excellent invaders that have had negative impacts on native species and humans. Many invasive species move from warmer to cooler climates. For these species, thermal adaptations may both be important for their ability to invade and to limit their invasion range. The invasion of Polistes dominulus into North America provides an example of a primitively eusocial invader from a warmer climate. We studied the differences in thermoregulation between P. dominulus and the native P. fuscatus. We found that, during flight, thorax temperature in P. fuscatus was less affected by ambient temperature than thorax temperature of P. dominulus. We also found that P. dominulus and P. fuscatus showed different patterns of warming after removal from a cold environment. Unlike P. dominulus, live P. fuscatus never fully cooled down in a cold environment. P. fuscatus also reached their relative minimum flight temperatures earlier than P. dominulus, but P. dominulus maintained higher elevated temperatures for longer. These differences in thermoregulatory ability suggest that the lower winter survival of P. dominulus could be offset by a greater thermal tolerance during flight, while the lower thermal tolerance of P. fuscatus in flight is offset somewhat by better thermoregulatory ability.
