Host range expansion by Rhopalomyia yomogicola (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) from a native to an alien species of Artemisia (Asteraceae) in Japan
In 2001, subconical galls were found on the leaves of an alien Artemisia species (Asteraceae) in Ibusuki City, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. These galls were quite similar to those induced by Rhopalomyia yomogicola (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) on Artemisia princeps, Artemisia montana, and Artemisia japonica in Japan. The morphological features of the pupal head and molecular sequencing data indicated that the gall midge from the alien Artemisia was identical to R. yomogicola. Usually, galling insects do not expand readily their host range to alien plants, but R. yomogicola is considered to have expanded its host range to the alien Artemisia by its multivoltine life history trait and oligophagous habit across two different botanical sections of the genus Artemisia. Adult abdominal tergites and sternites and immature stages of R. yomogicola are described for the first time and detailed biological information is presented.
