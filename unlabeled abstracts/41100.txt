Germination biology of four climatically varied populations of the invasive species African lovegrass (Eragrostis curvula)
African lovegrass [ Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees] is a highly invasive C 4 perennial grass that threatens global biodiversity. Appropriate management of the species has been hampered by a lack of knowledge of the species' seed ecology, resulting in significant economic and environmental impacts within various environments. Consequently, this study explored the effects of a selection of environmental factors (photoperiod, alternating temperature, pH and salinity) by analysing several measures of germination on four geographically distinct populations of E. curvula to assist in its extirpation from infested sites. Seeds were collected in Australia from Maffra and Shepparton, Victoria; Tenterfield, New South Wales and Midvale, Western Australia. Key results showed that seeds from Maffra (54% vs. 79%), Tenterfield (38% vs. 61%) and Shepparton (34% vs. 71%) had significantly reduced germination in complete darkness compared to an alternating 12 hours light and 12 hours dark photoperiod, whereas Midvale had consistent germination (91% vs. 99%). Temperatures between 17/7 O C reduced germination for Maffra (42% vs. 73%), Tenterfield (34% vs. 55%) and Shepparton (33% vs. 59%) compared to the mean of all other temperature combinations, whereas, Midvale had consistent germination. Furthermore, germination for all populations was consistent between pH 4 and 9. For salinity, germination was significantly reduced at >=100 mM for Maffra (29% vs. 67%), >=150 mM for Tenterfield (29% vs. 94%) and Shepparton (39.5% vs. 81.5%), and 250 mM for Midvale (39% vs. 82%) compared to the mean of all other concentrations. Although each trial was conducted independently, they can be used to generate species targeted management. Such strategies include maintaining high levels of quarantine and hygiene programs to avoid future spread, where practical apply light-limiting strategies (mulching, tilling or scraping) for the Maffra, Tenterfield and Shepparton populations; and maintaining management efforts year round as the species can germinate under a wide range of conditions.
