Invasive species: customs intercepts reveal what makes a good ant stowaway.
Suarez et al.'s [4] analysis capitalized on an unparalleled dataset accumulated by decades-long collecting, data-basing, and vouchering efforts coordinated between the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the NMNH at the Smithsonian Institution. Insects detected during USDA import inspections were sent to the Entomology Department of the NMNH, where they were catalogued, retrievably stored, and curated for future research. The true value and full utility of this unparalleled collection have decidedly emerged now with the analysis reported by Suarez et al. [4].
