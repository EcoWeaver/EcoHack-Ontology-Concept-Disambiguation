Common deficiencies of actions for managing invasive alien species: a decision-support checklist
Despite the increasing number of invasive species, protocols devoted to assess the feasibility (i.e., probability of success or failure) of management actions in the field are scarce, yet success depends on a broad scope of issues beyond the biology of species and the ecosystem to be managed. In this paper we make a retrospective analysis of 90 actions and management proposals developed in Andalusia (southern Spain) in 2004 to 2018. Actions included 59 terrestrial and aquatic taxa. We identified items that in case of deficiency were responsible for either the rejection of action proposals (n = 44) or failure of implemented actions for which the goal was not achieved (n = 22). The most frequent deficiencies included the absence of funding during the necessary time to achieve the goals, the risk of reinvasion and an insufficient removal rate to achieve the specific objective. Based on the deficiencies found, we built a comprehensive, broad-scope compliance checklist to assist decision-makers to identify deficiencies before action. In addition, implemented actions for which the goal was achieved (n = 24) were used for validating the checklist. The checklist contains 40 items related to IAS features, administrative features, methodology effectiveness, efficiency and impacts of the action, and invaded ecosystem features. The checklist is valid across all taxa and habitats. The use of this checklist will help reduce the degree of arbitrariness and subjectivity of actions aimed at managing IAS, and a more efficient use of resources.
