Growth and reproductive investment of introduced Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas in southern European waters
Growth and reproductive investment of cultured Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas were studied in two south-western European estuaries: the Ria de Ribadeo in Spain and the Ria Formosa in Portugal. Developing gonads were found in individuals >23.5 mm shell length in the Ria Formosa and >27.5 mm shell length in the Ria de Ribadeo. Although the amount of gonadal mass in relation to total body mass was higher in the Ria de Ribadeo, oysters from this location did not spawn completely. In contrast, oysters from the Ria Formosa completely emptied their gonad during spawning. Reproduction and, consequently, the maximum potential for population expansion may be constrained in both areas: in the Ria de Ribadeo due to suboptimal spawning threshold temperatures and in the Ria Formosa due to higher metabolic costs caused by warmer winter temperatures. Nevertheless, in comparison to northern oyster populations, Portuguese and Spanish populations have higher reproductive output. If suitable environmental conditions are met, expansion of Portuguese and Spanish populations will most likely occur. In the Ria Formosa, where environmental conditions for growth and reproduction are favourable, wild oysters are already observed. In order to follow the dynamics of oyster populations and predict possible negative effects on the ecosystems, it is important to continue monitoring the physiological performance of C. gigas in these areas.
