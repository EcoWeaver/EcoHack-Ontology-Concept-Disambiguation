Northward expansion of the invasive green algae Codium fragile spp. fragile (Suringar) Hariot, 1889 into coastal waters of Newfoundland, Canada
Invasive green alga Codium fragile spp. fragile (Suringar) Hariot, 1889 thalli were first detected in Newfoundland (Canada) within Mortier Bay (southwestern Placentia Bay) in August 2012. Subsequent SCUBA surveys in 2013 found Codium attached to subtidal substrates in Arnold's Cove (northeastern Placentia Bay) and on the northern coast of central Newfoundland near Pilley's Island (Notre Dame Bay), which is currently the most northern location of Codium in Atlantic Canada. Due to large distances between confirmed sightings, further surveys are recommended to determine the distribution range of Codium and its possible dispersal vectors in Newfoundland coastal waters. Implications of an invasion by Codium on coastal Newfoundland ecosystems are yet to be determined but potential concerns include the replacement of native kelp species, as previously documented elsewhere in Atlantic Canada.
