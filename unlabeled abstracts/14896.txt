Comparison of 13C and 15N discrimination factors and turnover rates between congeneric crayfish Orconectes rusticus and O. virilis (Decapoda, Cambaridae)
Ecological applications of stable isotope analysis are dependent on knowing consumer-diet discrimination factors (D) and consumer metabolic turnover rates (m). We used an 80-day laboratory experiment to test for differences in the d13C, d15N and m of two species of crayfish (Orconectes rusticus and O. virilis) fed one of two diets (algae wafers and bloodworms). Over the course of the experiment, the d13C and d15N signatures of the crayfish approached equilibrium with those of their diets. We fit our data to a growth-based model and found d13C, d15N, and m to be largely indistinguishable between species, except in the case of d15N and m of crayfish on the algae diet. We thus pooled parameters to calculate D13C (algae diet: 1.57%0 [95% confidence interval: 0.86-2.35]; bloodworm diet: 0.8%0 [0.14-1.55]) and D15N (bloodworm diet: 1.2%0 [0.32-2.11]), and used species-specific data to calculate D15N for the algae diet (O. rusticus: 2.54%0 [2.06-3.08]; O. virilis: 3.35%0 [2.53-4.51]). Our results provide values of stable isotope D and m for applications to crayfish, and offer a rare comparison of these values between two closely related species and to commonly used literature values.
