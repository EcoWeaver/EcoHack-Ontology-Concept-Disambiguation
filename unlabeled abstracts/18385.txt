The status quo of invasive alien insect species and plant quarantine in Korea
The recent increase in agricultural commodities from abroad and travelers due to the economic growth and globalization in Korea has resulted in an increase in invasive alien insect species establishing in Korea. When "alien" is defined as species introduced after the beginning of the Greater Korean Empire Era (1897), 171 insect species are considered invasive alien species. On average, 0.85 alien insect species have become established each year for the last 40 years, and 76.6% of the alien insect species are economic agricultural pests. The annual invasion rate and the pest interceptions from imported cut flowers, planting material, and vegetables have been increasing rapidly. Traveler's baggage is an important pathway for fruit flies. Most of the alien pests that were first found in Japan were confirmed in Korea at least 3 years later until the 1990s, but the pattern has been reversed since the 2000s. Thus, continuous information sharing with neighboring countries such as Japan and China is needed to develop a system for early detection and prompt action against invading insect species. Thus, we introduce and summarize the present status of invasive alien insect species in Korea.
