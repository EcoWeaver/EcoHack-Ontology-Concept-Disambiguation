Simultaneous Inductive and Deductive Modeling of Ecological Systems via Evolutionary Computation and Information Theory
The addition of two emerging technologies (evolutionary computation and ecoinformatics) to com- putational ecology can advance our ability to build better ecological models and thus deepen our understanding of the mechanistic complexity of ecological systems. This article describes one feasi- ble approach toward this goal--the combining of inductive and deductive modeling techniques with the optimizing power of simple algorithms of Darwinian evolution that include information-theoretic model selection methods. Specifically, the author shows a way to extend classic genetic algorithms beyond typical parameter fitting of a single, previously chosen model to a more flexible technique that can work with a suite of possible models. Inclusion of the Akaike information-theoretic model selection method within an evolutionary algorithm makes it possible to accomplish simultaneous pa- rameter fitting and parsimonious model selection. Experiments with synthetic data show the feasibility of this approach, and experiments with time-series field data of the zebra mussel invasion of Lake Champlain (United States) result in a model of the invasion dynamics that is consistent with the known hydrodynamic features of the lake and the motile life history stage of this invasive species. The author also describes a way to extend this approach with a modified genetic programming algorithm.
