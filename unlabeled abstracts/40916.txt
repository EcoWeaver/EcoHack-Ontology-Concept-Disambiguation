Invasion waves for a diffusive predator-prey model with two preys and one predator
In this paper, we study the existence of invasion waves of a diffusive predator-prey model with two preys and one predator. The existence of traveling semi-fronts connecting invasion-free equilibrium with wave speed [Formula: see text] is obtained by Schauder's fixed-point theorem, where [Formula: see text] is the minimal wave speed. The boundedness of such waves is shown by rescaling method and such waves are proved to connect coexistence equilibrium by LaSalle's invariance principle. The existence of traveling front with wave speed [Formula: see text] is got by rescaling method and limit arguments. The non-existence of traveling fronts with speed [Formula: see text] is shown by Laplace transform.
