Reproduction strategies in introduced Nymphoides peltata populations revealed by genetic markers
To determine whether introduced Nymphoides peltata populations reproduced vegetatively or sexually, microsatellites were used to study the genetic structure of the species in Sweden. Leaves from 156 plants and seeds from 4 plants were sampled from 7 water-systems and analysed. A total of 10 genotypes were found among the 156 leaves. Seeds accounted for one additional genotype per seed. Lack of genetic variation and entirely vegetative reproduction dominated in the introduced N. peltata populations although sexual reproduction was found in one water-system. However, even where the species reproduced sexually, vegetative reproduction constituted an important part of the total reproduction.
