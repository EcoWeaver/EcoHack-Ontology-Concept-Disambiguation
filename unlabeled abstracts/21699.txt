The copepod invader Skistodiaptomus pallidus (Herrick, 1879) (Crustacea, Copepoda, Diaptomidae) from North America in water bodies of Bremen, northern Germany
The paper presents the first European records of the copepod (Crustacea, Calanoida, Diaptomidae) Skistodiaptomus pallidus in shallow eutrophic waters indirectly connected with the Weser River, Northern Germany. Its original distribution is in the Mississippi basin of the United States of America. It is probable that this species entered the Weser River via ship ballast.
