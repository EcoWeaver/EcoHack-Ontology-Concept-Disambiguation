Human-Spider Entanglements: Understanding and Managing the Good, the Bad, and the Venomous
Considering the fear that spiders can generate in humans, examining human-spider interactions in urban settings may at first glance appear odd. However, human-spider interactions, which occur quite frequently in urban settings, do not necessarily have to be negative; they can, in some cases, foster respect and tolerance (sometimes through avoidance). When one considers how global transformations, invasive species, urbanization, and adaptation will impact human-spider interactions, a review of the literature pertaining to these encounters is timely. We begin this discussion by describing spiders and providing an overview of some of their positive and negative impacts. Challenges regarding species identification and envenoming are also discussed. After the role of biological, psychological, and social aspects in human-spider interactions are re-examined, we provide future options aimed at organizing broad-scale public programs for five specific target groups: 1) the general public, 2) health professionals, 3) educators, 4) naturalists, and 5) researchers. In the conclusion, we provide potential management and educational strategies aimed at increasing our knowledge and tolerance of these animals in urban settings.
