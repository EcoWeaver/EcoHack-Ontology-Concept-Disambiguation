Host preference of Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Hymenoptera: Braconidae, Aphidiinae), an alien aphid parasitoid in Benin
Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae, Aphidiinae) is a newly discovered species alien to Benin (West Africa) and the dominating aphid primary parasitoid in vegetable agroecosystems. A study on the preference of this parasitic hymenopteran for three key aphid pests of vegetables (Aphis craccivora Koch, Aphis gossypii Glover and Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach) (Homoptera: Aphididae)) was carried out under choice and no-choice conditions at 26 ^ 1 8C in both Petri dishes and cages. The aphidiine rejected L. erysimi and did not oviposit in this aphid species in any of the trials. In all tests, A. gossypii proved to be the aphid host preferred most frequently by L. testaceipes. This study contributes to the fundamental knowledge on the oviposition behaviour of L. testaceipes and provides information for use in the development of sustainable aphid pest management strategies in Benin.
