The growth of pike (Esox lucius Linnaeus, 1798) in Lake Trasimeno (Umbria, Italy)
The growth of the pike (Esox lucius L.) population of Lake Trasimeno was studied. A total of 166 specimens was captured in two monthly sampling series, from May 1993 to 1994 and from February to April 1998. There were 45 females and 79 males; nine age classes were present. Regression analysis between total length (TL) and weight (W) was W  0:0001 A TL 3.0366 ; no signi(r)cant differences between sexes were recorded. The parameter values for the von Bertalanffy growth curve for length were L I  162:76 cm, K  0:089 yr A1 and t 0  0:29 yr. An inverse Lee phenomenon exists for the 2-, 3-and 4-year-old age classes in the Lake Trasimeno population, indicating a differential mortality which favoured the survival of the larger individuals. One-year-old specimens were excluded from this phenomenon. Competition between pike and the exotic species largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides Lac.), recently introduced in Lake Trasimeno, could explain the differential mortality in pike, especially in the smaller specimens during winter. # 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
