CRAYFISH MANAGEMENT FOR SWISS WATERS
Seven species of crayfish are present in Swiss waters: three native ones (Astacus astacus, Austropotamobius pallipes, Austropotamobius torrentium) and four exotic ones (Astacus leptodactylus, Orconectes limosus, Pacifastacus leniusculus, Procambarus clarkii). The occurrence of each species is known and distribution maps have been drawn at national level. Many of the non-native populations have been identified as carriers of the crayfish plague, acting as a vector for Aphanomyces astaci. Crayfish are regulated by the Swiss Fisheries Legislation. The catching of the native species is allowed but the effective fishing pressure is low. The non-native species are considered as undesirable. For that reason importation, introduction and transportation of live specimens are forbidden with the exception of Cherax sp. which may be kept in cool boxes without any contact with water until consumption. A national management plan has been developed by the Federal Off ice for the Environment. It aims at increasing protective measures for the native species and enhancing population control for the non-native ones. The elimination measures are targeted on the most problematic species Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii.
