Didymo Control: Increasing the Effectiveness of Decontamination Strategies and Reducing Spread
Nuisance algal blooms formed by the benthic diatom Didymosphenia geminata (didymo) have been spreading rapidly, with negative ecological and economic effects. This microscopic alga is transported on fishing equipment, and controlling the spread of didymo involves proper cleaning of gear. Our study experimentally tested several common decontamination treatments and determined the response of state agencies and fishermen to decontamination procedures. In testing decontamination products, we found that dish liquid detergent was the most effective, followed by bleach, Virkon, and salt. Decontaminants were more effective on cells that were not still attached to their stalks. From the fishermen's perspective, didymo was the aquatic invasive species of highest concern, but there was a wide range of approaches to didymo control. Our final recommendations concentrate on the importance of comprehensive information sources and standards for didymo decontamination and education, specifically, and for invasive/nuisance species more generally.
