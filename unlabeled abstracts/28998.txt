Molecular and morphological differentiation between the crop and weedy types in velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.) using a chloroplast DNA marker: seed source of the present invasive velvetleaf in Japan
A comparison of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences was carried out between the crop and weed types of Abutilon theophrasti to clarify the seed source of the present weedy velvetleaf in Japan. A sequencing analysis of approx. 6% of the chloroplast genome (ca 10 kbp) detected three nucleotide substitutions, one six-base-pair insertion/deletion (indel) and one 30-base pair inversion, which distinguish two haplotypes of cpDNA. A PCR-based survey of the indel and the inversion revealed that the 93 accessions of velvetleaf collected from the world could be divided into two groups. A morphological marker (capsule color) could be used to discriminate the crop type and the weed type, and hence, along with cpDNA haplotype, to distinguish three genotypes (Type I, II, and III). All Japanese cultivars and crop accessions from other countries were Type I. Weed types were divided into Type II and III. All of the samples from the USA, and the samples taken from grain imports to Japan were Type III. Since most of the weedy types distributed in Japan were of Type III, it is argued that they were introduced as seeds in the imported grain. We also found that the Type II plants sporadically occurred in Japan. It is suggested that they originated as hybrids, with indigenous cultivars as the maternal ancestor. Such hybrids must have survived since the cessation of velvetleaf cultivation about a century ago.
