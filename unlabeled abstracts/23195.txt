Uses of invasive alien plant species in Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary of Bangladesh
An exploratory survey was conducted on the uses and role of invasive alien species (IAS) to local livelihoods in the Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary in the northeastern hilly region of Bangladesh. Vegetation was sampled in 50 quadrates, each 10 mx10 m, and 25 line transects, each 50 mx20 m, through a combination of random and systematic sampling. Group discussions were also arranged with fifty local inhabitants (17 % of the total inhabitants) to learn the various uses of IAS. A total of 17 alien plant species belonging to 10 different families, of which Leguminosae constitutes the highest number (5 species), include tree (53%) followed by herb (12%), shrub (12%) and others (weed, climber and palm). The majority of the identified species were found to be used for fuel, followed by timber production, medicinal or curative uses, fodder, and many others. In addition to providing various forest products, alien tree species planted in forest plantation help provide many vital ecosystem services such as soil amelioration through nitrogen fixation. It is true that the alien species have some negative impacts on local ecosystems, and not all of them are harmful. Therefore, a national programme must be initiated to distinguish the harmful from the harmless species and to identify the uses and impacts of the former and latter.
