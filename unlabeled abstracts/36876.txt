Characterizing an invasion assemblage: first comparison of insect communities on native and introduced subspecies of Phragmites australis in Ontario, Canada
Introduced Phragmites (Phragmites australis ssp. australis) forms part of an invasion assemblage in North America that includes non-native insect herbivores and parasitoids, some of which are now found on both the introduced and native subspecies of Phragmites (P. australis ssp. americanus). This insect assemblage is key to understanding the impact of P. australis invasion and interpreting the efficacy of biological control used against introduced P. australis. Our study provides the first dedicated comparison of insect assemblages associated with native and introduced P. australis in Canada. From a 2016 to 2017 survey of 28 geographically paired sites across Ontario, Canada, fourteen insect taxa were recorded from both subspecies. Genotype had no effect on a-diversity but stem attack rates from at least one herbivore were higher on native populations than on paired introduced populations (+ 18.6%). We report the first record of Chaetococcus phragmitis (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) and Rhizedra lutosa (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Canada and of R. lutosa and Lasioptera hungarica (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) on native P. australis in North America.
