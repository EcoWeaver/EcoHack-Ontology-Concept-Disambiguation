Control of invasive Spartina alterniflora: A review
Spartina alterniflora has important ecological functions in its original place, such as bank protection and land reclamation, but often has negative impacts on the local ecosystem after it is introduced into new areas. This species is often considered as an invasive one. The invasion and control of S. alterniflora have caused a great concern. We reviewed the latest research progresses in the prevention and control of S. alterniflora from six different perspectives, including physical control, chemical control, biological control, biological substitution control, integrated control, and control strategies. The theoretical basis, technical details, control effect and environmental impact of the six kinds of control technologies were analyzed. We pointed out the shortcomings of existing control technologies and proposed some suggestions such as targeted control of different ecological risk zones.
