Island size and remoteness have major conservation significance for how spatial diversity is partitioned in skinks
Islands are often acknowledged as a refuge for species with declining mainland distributions. However, as the finite size of islands coupled with isolation can lead to genetic deterioration within insular populations, the study of these systems is of great interest to the conservation of biological diversity and persistence. The remote Kimberley region in Western Australia is facing increased impacts from invasive species, habitat fragmentation, grazing, mining and altered fire regimes, and many of the 2633 islands in the Kimberley have come into focus as a significant conservation resource. The Bar-shouldered skink (Ctenotus inornatus) is a habitat generalist that is highly abundant throughout the Kimberley and its diverse islands. This study encompasses 41 islands and seven mainland populations in the vast Kimberley environment, and genetically characterises them using 18 nuclear (microsatellite) markers. The island populations lost heterozygosity at a rate of 1 % per kilometre from the mainland. Diversity was significantly lower on islands of small size (
