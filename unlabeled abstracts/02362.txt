Introduced ants in the United Arab Emirates
Fifteen species of introduced ants, including eight cosmopolitan or tramp species, are recorded for the first time in the United Arab Emirates. They areCardiocondyla emeryi,Camponotus compressus,Iridomyrmex anceps,Linepithema humile,Monomorium destructor,Monomorium indicum,Pachycondyla sennaarensis,Paratrechina flavipes,Paratrechina jaegerskioeldi,Paratrechina longicornis,Pheidole teneriffana,Solenopsis geminata,Tapinoma melanocephalum,Tapinoma simrothiandTetramorium bicarinatum. A synopsis of their distribution, biology and pest status is given. Introduced species contribute an unusually high proportion of local ants and the ecological implications of their presence are discussed, including displacement of native fauna and impact upon human health. These ants abound in man-made, mesic environments and do not reach the characteristic sandy deserts of the region. Most invasive species are probably benign, butP.sennaarensis,M.destructorandS.geminatapose potential problems as public health and nuisance pests. The highly competitiveS. geminataandL. humilemay also threaten the local entomofauna and biodiversity.
