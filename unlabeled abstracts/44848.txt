Fruit provisioning of an invasive tree (Triadica sebifera) varies with environment and among populations
Plants vary in their reproductive allocation to embryo provisioning and seed dispersal. This may be mediated by genetic and/or environmental factors, resulting in varying seed properties among populations and years but few studies have explored this for invasive plants. Chinese Tallow Tree (Triadica sebifera) is a problematic invasive species in the southeastern United States. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that digest the waxy coating and excrete the seed. Here, we determined seed (resources for embryo) and wax mass (reward for disperser) for individual trees from 22 populations along a gradient from Texas to North Carolina over ~ 20 years. We used historical temperature, precipitation, and drought data to explore environmental effects on fruit provisioning. Seed sizes varied little for an individual tree in a given year. Wax mass of populations in locations with wet fall weather on average had greater absolute and relative wax mass. Seed mass was higher in years with wet spring weather and lower with more severe drought in the fall. Wax mass was higher in years with warm, dry winters. This suggests that environmental effects on fruit provisioning of this invasive tree vary by season with allocation to embryo resources sensitive to moisture during early and late fruit development and allocation to dispersal depending more on weather during dormancy.
