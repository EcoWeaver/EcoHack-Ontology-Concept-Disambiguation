Departure from naturalized to invasive stage: a disturbance-induced mechanism and associated interacting factors
Aims Within a habitat of multiple plant species, increased resource availabilities and altered species abundances following disturbances create opportunities for exotic species to successfully establish and subsequently naturalize into its non-native environment. Such post-disturbance changes in abiotic and biotic environments may also promote a naturalized exotic species (or invading species) to become invasive through rapid colonization of the habitat sites by reducing the extent and size of resident plant species. By combining species life history traits with that of the disturbance-induced changes in habitat characteristics, we aimed to determine those interacting factors and associated mechanism allowing an exotic invasion to start off.
