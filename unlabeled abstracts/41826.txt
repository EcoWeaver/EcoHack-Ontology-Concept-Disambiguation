Are successful colonizers necessarily invasive species ? The case of the so-called "invading parthogenetic cockroach", Pycnoscelus surinamensis , in the Brazilian Atlantic forest
Successful colonizers are potentially invasive species. They offer the opportunity to study the first steps toward invasions, even if these colonizing species failed until now to become invasive. They should allow the critical characteristics which first permit species to become invasive to be better understood, especially when comparing failed and successful invasions. This kind of analysis complements the listing of all characteristics of invasive species which are supposed to favor invasiveness. The so-called invasive parthenogenetic cockroach, Pycnoscelus surinamensis, has been studied in the Atlantic region of Brazil to assess if it is able to spread from colonized plantations to adjacent disturbed forest fragments. P. surinamensis is extremely rare in forest fragments and its presence cannot be related to its commonness in adjacent plantations but merely to man's activity inside the fragment. This cockroach is only a successful colonizer, not an invasive species. Pending on further observations, we hypothesize that its failure to invade is probably related to a low ability for dispersal.
