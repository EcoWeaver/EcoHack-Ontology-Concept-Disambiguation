Asymmetrical pollen success in Ipomopsis (Polemoniaceae) contact sites.
Variation in hybridization rates among contact sites of a species pair provides an opportunity for assessing the importance of individual reproductive isolating mechanisms in limiting gene flow between species and thus promoting speciation. Conspecific pollen advantage is common in angiosperms, but its importance as a reproductive isolating mechanism is uncertain. We compared the strength of conspecific pollen advantage in two Ipomopsis aggregata-I. tenuituba (Polemoniaceae) contact sites that differ in frequency of natural hybrids. We performed hand pollinations of single-and 1:1 mixed-species pollen loads, using donor and recipient plants from both contact sites. Paternity of offspring from mixed-species pollinations was determined using an allozyme marker. Donors from the high frequency hybrid site showed no conspecific pollen advantage; both species sired seeds in proportion to their fraction of the pollen load (0.5). In contrast, I. aggregata from the low frequency hybrid site sired 70-85% of offspring on recipients from both sites. These results suggest that pollen interactions can influence the level of natural hybridization. They also suggest the importance of geographic variation in reproductive isolation, which should be considered in studies of biological invasions and exposure of engineered crops to wild relatives.
