European minnows through time: museum collections aid genetic assessment of species introductions in freshwater fishes (Cyprinidae: Phoxinus species complex)
Massive fish introductions have taken place throughout much of the world, mostly over the last 70 years, and present a major threat to the genetic diversity of native fishes. Introductions have been reported for European Phoxinus, a ubiquitous small cyprinid that populates a wide variety of habitats. Species delineation in European Phoxinus has proven difficult with one reason being ranges of distribution that often traverse drainage boundaries. The present study combines recent samples with museum samples to better understand the current distribution of Phoxinus species and their distributions prior to the massive introductions of fishes in Europe, and to evaluate the use of museum specimens for species distribution studies. For these purposes, genetic lineages from sites collected prior to 1900 (n = 14), and between 1900 and 1950 (n = 8), were analysed using two mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Although possible fish introductions were detected, our results show that the distribution of genetic lineages of museum samples is comparable to that of the extant lineages of European Phoxinus present in those areas. These observations suggest that in the studied ranges the distribution of Phoxinus lineages has been driven by natural processes.
