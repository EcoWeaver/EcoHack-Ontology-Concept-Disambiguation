No evidence for ecological segregation protecting native trout from invasive hybridization.
We appreciate the comments of Young et al. (2017) on our recent paper (Muhlfeld et al., 2017) concerning spatiotemporal dynamics of hybridization between native westslope cutthroat trout (Oncoryhnchus clarkii lewisi; WCT) and introduced coastal rainbow trout (O. mykiss irideus; RBT). Nevertheless, we believe there is no evidence for "ecological segregation" protecting WCT from invasive RBT. Here we consider their three major arguments for ecological segregation and find their conclusions invalid. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
