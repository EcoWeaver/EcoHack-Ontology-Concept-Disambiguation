New records of Corbicula clams in French rivers
The aim of this paper is to present new data and review the current distribution of Corbicula spp. in France. Three morphotypes were recorded during the study - "round form", "light R form" and "saddle form". During April 2009, Corbicula spp. were found in several watercourses in France, including three rivers (Canal de la Somme, Oise and Vilaine) where the taxa were not previously reported. In addition, this is the first report of form S in the River Seine and, the first record of the "light R form" in the River Gard. Molluscs of the genus Corbicula are considered to be a well established alien species in large rivers.
