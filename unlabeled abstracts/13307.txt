International plant trade associated risks: Laissez-faire or novel solutions
The trade of plants and plant products is globally the most important pathway for alien pests and pathogens causing considerable damage to plant health. The introductions have increased exponentially in Europe, and continued even in Australia, where extreme quarantine efforts are implemented. The commercial actors in international plant trade lack a strong motive to reduce pest and pathogen risks as the true costs of the practiced trade are not internalized in the pricing of the products but footed to taxpayers and land owners. Therefore a shared responsibility of international plant traders is suggested to complement the current legislative restrictions in controlling exotic pests and pathogens.
