Biological Control of Invasive Weed Species: Nigerian Experience
The free movement of goods and humans across all boarders of the world has permitted some species to take dominance outside their country of origins. These species are termed as Invasive Alien Species. Invasive weed species are those weeds that have extensive recruitment into a population without human intervention. They are also termed as plant invaders, as alien plants that invade and oust native vegetations. Invasive weed species have however, impacted negatively on their new area of invasion leading to untold hardship on the people particularly the poor resource farmers, the biodiversity including entomofauna and phytoflora. Most of these weed species smoother out the native species forcing them into extinction while others produce allellopathic substances that clear off other species around them. Several control measures have been used mostly chemical but have not actually give the desired results instead more problems were created such as environment and human contamination, development of resistance, resurgence and high cost of procurement. Biological control has been effective on many occasions though its result is slow, costly in short- run but cost effective and self perpetuating in the long-run. It has been used against alien species in several countries of the world including The United State of America, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and South Africa. Though some countries in Africa have implemented programmes on biocontrol of several alien weed species, some including Nigeria have not fare well in this regard. This review intends to discuss biological control of the siam weed, Chromolaena odorata (L.) [Asteraceae: Eupatoriae] and Water Hyacinth, Eichhornia Crassipes (Mart.) Solmes in Nigeria, the progress made, the challenges, prospects and recommendations for further improvement.
