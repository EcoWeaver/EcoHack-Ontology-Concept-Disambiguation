Competitive ability, thermal tolerance and invasion success in exotic Daphnia lumholtzi
We performed laboratory competition experiments with the invasive Daphnia lumholtzi and native North American Daphnia pulicaria at three temperatures. Daphnia pulicaria was the superior competitor at 20 and 24degC, while this dominance pattern shifted at 28degC. This observation of a temperature-mediated shift in competitive dominance suggests that a high thermal tolerance in D. lumholtzi has favoured its successful invasion in southern areas of North America. Combined with benefits of inducible defences, our work suggests a multi-faceted explanation for this invaders success. (c) The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.
