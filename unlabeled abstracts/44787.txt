Potential phytoremediation of Pampa biome native and invasive grass species cohabiting vineyards contaminated with Cu in Southern Brazil
The objectives were (a) to evaluate whether grasses native to the Pampa biome, Axonopus affinis Chase, Paspalum notatum Flugge and Paspalum plicatulum Michx, and the invasive grass Cynodon dactylon (L.). Pers have the potential to phytoremediate soil contaminated with Cu (0, 35 and 70 mg Cu kg-1); (b) assess whether the growth of these species is compromised by the excess of Cu available in the soil; and (c) determine the impact of excess Cu on the physiological responses of the studied species. C. dactylon presented the best performance in soil contaminated with 35 mg of Cu kg-1. In C. dactylon, the concentrations of chlorophyll b and carotenoids increased, as did the photosynthetic rate and plant growth. Phytotoxic effects of Cu in soil contaminated with 70 mg of Cu kg-1 were more severe on A. affinis and led to plant death. The other species presented reduced photosynthetic and growth rates, as well as increased activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and guaiacol peroxidase. This very same Cu level has decreased photosynthetic pigment concentrations in P. notatum and P. plicatulum. On the other hand, it did not change chlorophyll a and b concentrations in C. dactylon and increased carotenoid concentrations in it. High values recorded for Cu bioaccumulation-in-grass-root factor, mainly in P. plicatulum, have indicated that the investigated plants are potential phytostabilizers. High C. dactylon biomass production--in comparison to other species--compensates for the relatively low metal concentration in its tissues by increasing metal extraction from the soil. This makes C. dactylon more efficient in the phytoremediation process than other species.
