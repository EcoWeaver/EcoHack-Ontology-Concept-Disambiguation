Ecological and biological traits of non-native freshwater fish species differentiate them from native species in China
China's freshwater ecosystems are gradually invaded by an increasing number of non-native fish species. However, to date, some controversy about the number of native and non-native freshwater fish species in wild habitats and very limited information on ecological or biological traits mediating fish introduction success at a national scale have prevented the proposal and implementation of targeted conservation and management strategies. To address these urgent issues, first we compiled an up-to-date inventory of 1,797 fish species (1,597, 84, and 116 native, exotic (originating from outside China), and translocated (originating from within China) species, respectively) along with 13 traits encompassing various ecological and life-history strategies for each species, which is the most comprehensive freshwater fish database in China as we know. Here, we found that non-native species mainly belonged to three orders (Perciformes, Siluriformes, and Cypriniformes) and three families (Cichlidae, Cyprinidae, and Salmonidae). Native species were significantly (P < 0.001) different from both exotic and translocated species according to their quantitative traits, while no remarkable differences between exotic and translocated species were detected (P = 0.93). Specifically, G-tests of independence, Similarity Percentage Analysis (SIMPER), and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum tests showed that compared to native species, species with relatively higher vulnerability (intrinsic vulnerability of fishes to fishing), trophic level, and pectoral fin vertical position, but less resilience and lateral body shape were deemed as potential candidates for introduction and dispersal in China.
