The invasive snail Melanoides tuberculata (M&uuml;ller, 1774) (Gastropoda, Thiaridae) in the lower basin of the Sin&uacute; River, C&oacute;rdoba, Colombian Caribbean
We record the invasive thiarid snail Melanoides tuberculata (Muller, 1774) for the first time in the lower basin of the Sinu River, Cordoba, Colombia. We counted 2,892 individuals and collected 38 specimens at 4 localities in the basin. The introduction of this species is suspected to have occurred in different ways, but human transport and the aquarium trade are the most probable pathways. The presence of this species in the Sinu River is especially important because of its potential spread to other river basins in the region.
