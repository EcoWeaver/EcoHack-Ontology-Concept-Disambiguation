Uncertain future of New England salt marshes
Salt marsh plant communities have long been envisioned as dynamic, resilient systems that quickly recover from human impacts and natural disturbances. But are salt marshes sufficiently resilient to withstand the escalating intensity and scale of human impacts in coastal environments? In this study we examined the independent and interactive effects of emerging threats to New England salt marshes (temperature increase, accelerating eutrophication, consumer-driven salt marsh die-off, and sea level rise) to understand the future trajectory of these ecologically valuable ecosystems. While marsh plant communities remain resilient to many disturbances, loss of critical foundation species and changing tidal inundation regimes may short circuit marsh resilience in the future. Accelerating sea level rise and salt marsh die-off in particular may interact to overwhelm the compensatory mechanisms of marshes and increase their vulnerability to drowning. Management of marshes will require difficult decisions to balance ecosystem service tradeoffs and conservation goals, which, in light of the immediate threat of salt marsh loss, should focus on maintaining ecosystem resilience.
