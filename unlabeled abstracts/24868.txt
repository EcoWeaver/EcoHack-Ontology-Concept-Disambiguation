Irradiance acclimation, capture ability, and efficiency in invasive and non-invasive alien plant species
We tested the hypothesis that invasive (IN) species could capture resources more rapidly and efficiently than noninvasive (NIN) species. Two IN alien species, Ageratina adenophora and Chromolaena odorata, and one NIN alien species, Gynura sp. were compared at five irradiances. Photon-saturated photosynthetic rate (P max), leaf mass (LMA) and nitrogen content (NA) per unit area, and photosynthetic nitrogen utilization efficiency (PNUE) increased significantly with irradiance. LMA, NA, and PNUE all contributed to the increased P max, indicating that both morphological and physiological acclimation were important for the three alien species. Under stronger irradiance, PNUE was improved through changes in N allocation. With the increase of irradiance, the amount of N converted into carboxylation and bioenergetics increased, whereas that allocated to light-harvesting components decreased. The three alien species could adequately acclimate to high irradiance by increasing the ability to utilize and dissipate photon energy and decreasing the efficiency of photon capture. The two IN species survived at 4.5 % irradiance while the NIN species Gynura died, representing their different invasiveness. Ageratina generally exhibited higher respiration rate (R D) and NA. However, distinctly higher P max, PNUE, P max/R D, or P max/LMA were not detected in the two invasive species, nor was lower LMA. Hence the abilities to capture and utilize resources were not always associated with invasiveness of the alien species.
