Characterization of the complete chloroplast genome of the invasive weed Galinsoga quadriradiata (Asterales: Asteraceae)
Galinsoga quadriradiata is an invasive weed in many parts of the world, and are causing serious damages to local biodiversity and agriculture. In this study, its complete chloroplast genome was assembled from the whole-genome Illumina sequencing data. The circular genome is 151,917 bp long, and comprises a pair of inverted repeat regions (IRs, 25,041 bp each), a large single-copy region (LSC, 83,620 bp) and a small single-copy region (SSC, 18,215 bp). It encodes a total of 111 gene species (80 protein-coding, 27 tRNA and four rRNA species), with 21 of them occurring in double copies. Introns were detected in ten PCG and six tRNA species. The nucleotide composition is asymmetric (31.07% A, 18.58% C, 19.08% G & 31.27% T) with an overall A + T content of 62.34%. Phylogenetic analysis challenged the traditional taxonomic framework of the family Asteraceae, and indicated that G. quadriradiata was relatively close to Guizotia abyssinica in phylogeny.
