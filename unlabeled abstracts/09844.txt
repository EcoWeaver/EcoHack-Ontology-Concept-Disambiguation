Variation in selection and utilization of host crops in the field and laboratory by Drosophila suzukii Matsumara (Diptera: Drosophilidae), an invasive frugivore.
Background: Drosophila suzukii, a pest of soft-skinned berries and stone fruits, has recently rapidly expanded its global range. The impacts of D. suzukii infestation and subsequent fruit damage in North America and Europe have been profound. The aim of the present work was to assess host selection of D. suzukii in the field and laboratory, with an emphasis on hosts commonly grown in the southeastern United States, where D. suzukii has been established since 2010. Results: Raspberries were infested at a greater rate than blackberries in the field, and varieties within both species were infested at different rates. Primocane-fruiting blackberries were often the least heavily infested. Further, blackberries and raspberries grown under high tunnels were infested at lower rates than those grown outside. Fruit and artificial substrates with a lower surface penetration force were more heavily infested than firmer substrates in the laboratory; no eggs were laid in artificial substrates exceeding 52.00 cN surface penetration force. Conclusion: Infestation rates differ between species and varieties within species of Rubus in the southeastern United States. Fruit penetration force is one potential measure of host susceptibility, but host attractiveness will likely depend upon additional factors, such as soluble sugar content.
