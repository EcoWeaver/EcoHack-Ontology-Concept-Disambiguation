Sequence Polymorphism of the Mitochondrial DNA Control Region in Native and Invasive Populations of Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae)
The harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis forms stable natural populations in East Asia and southern Siberia and spreading invasive populations in Europe, Africa, North America, and South America in regions with temperate and subtropical climate. The polymorphism of the mitochondrial genome control region was characterized in population samples from populations of the native range and invasive range in Europe. The division of the native range into the eastern and western groups and the closeness of the invasive population to the eastern population group were confirmed. Haplotype diversity is maximal in the population of the Harmonia axyridis eastern population group and is reduced in the invasive population. The stability of the haplotype composition of the mitochondrial gene pool in the European invasive population in the process of the invasive range expansion was demonstrated.
