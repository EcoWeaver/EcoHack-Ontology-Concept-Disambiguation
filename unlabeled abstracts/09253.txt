Redd superimposition by introduced rainbow trout,oncorhynchus mykiss, on native charrs in a japanese stream
Spawning redd superimposition of introduced, spring-spawning rainbow trout,Oncorhynchus mykiss, on native, fall-spawning Dolly varden,Salvelinus malma, and white-spotted charr,S. leucomaenis, were examined in a small stream in Hokkaido, Japan. The stream reaches in which Dolly Varden and white-sported charr redds were observed in fall 1997 greatly overlapped with the reaches in which rainbow trout redds were recorded in spring 1998. Spawning microhabitats were also similar between trout and the two charr species. Thirteen and 3% of Dolly Varden and white-spotted charr redds, respectively, were superimposed by rainbow trout redds. The eggs or alevins in the disturbed charr redds were potentially damaged because charrs were not likely to have emerged from the redds before the superimposition occurred. In sufficiently great abundance, introduced rainbow trout may negatively impact native charr populations by dislodging the latter's spawning redds.
