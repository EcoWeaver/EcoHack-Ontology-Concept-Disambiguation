Short Note: The first appearance and establishment of an alien vascular plant in natural habitats on the forefield of a retreating glacier in Antarctica
A striking feature of the Antarctic is the lack of diversityof vascular plants.Deschampsia antarcticaDesv. andColobanthus quitensisBartl. have inhabited the maritimeAntarctic forc.5000 years. Pollen grains of both speciesand macroremains of the grass have been identified in mid-Holocene peat deposits on the South Shetland Islands(Birkenmajeret al. 1985). However, there is no evidencefrom palaeorecords that any other vascular plants existedin this region during the Holocene, despite the fact that amajor source of potential immigrants is located only900 km to the north in Tierra del Fuego (Smith 2003).With the current trend in regional warming in the maritimeAntarctic (Kinget al. 2003) and a growing number ofvisitors there is an increasing probability that plants,previously unable to flourish because of adverse climaticconditions, will be able to become established.During our long-term botanical monitoring at King GeorgeIsland we have recorded the appearance of a third vascularplant species, firstly only in the anthropogenic zone (Olech1996), but more recently in natural habitats. This is an alienspecies, annual meadow grassPoa annuaL., which hascurrently colonized the moraines of the retreating EcologyGlacier (Fig. 1). Species usually associated with this habitatare the two native vascular plants, and mosses such asBryumpseudotriquetrum(Hedw.) P. Gaertn., B. Mey. & Scherb. andCeratodon purpureus(Hedw.) Brid.
