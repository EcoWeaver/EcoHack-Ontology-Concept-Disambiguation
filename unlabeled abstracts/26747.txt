Integration of invasion ecology theories into the analysis of designed plant communities: a case study in Southern Germany
Theories regarding the establishment and persistence of self-naturalising alien species can help in interpreting these processes in designed plant communities with their combination of exotic species and native plant communities. Thus, they may provide a theoretical basis for this kind of landscape design. A case study investigated the influence of plant community conditions (invasibility), species-specific traits (invasiveness), and gap diameter size on the establishment of selected North American prairie forbs in Central European horticultural meadows. Experimental sites were located in Freising, Bavaria. Introduced forbs included Aster laevis, Aster novae-angliae, Aster x salignus, and Aster x versicolor. Establishment success was measured as survival rate and total aboveground dry biomass. Invasibility of the investigated horticultural meadows was strongly related to resource availability, as most influences of plant community traits could ultimately be attributed to this factor. Leaf area and specific leaf area above canopy height of the resident meadow species appear to be the traits that best explained differences in establishment success of the Asters. Gap size influenced species performance mainly on the less productive site, again due to higher availability of resources in the larger gaps. These results are consistent with findings of studies on self-naturalising alien species. By applying this interdisciplinary approach, valuable insights in the functioning of designed plant communities could be gained. Horticultural meadows can be one important tool in designing the highly dynamic urban landscape. In choosing suitable sites, resource availability should be strongly considered.
