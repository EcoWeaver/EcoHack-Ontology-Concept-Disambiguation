Compliant lightweight non-invasive standalone "Marine Skin" tagging system
AbstractCurrent marine research primarily depends on weighty and invasive sensory equipment and telemetric network to understand the marine environment, including the diverse fauna it contains, as a function of animal behavior and size, as well as equipment longevity. To match animal morphology and activity within the surrounding marine environment, here we show a physically flexible and stretchable skin-like and waterproof autonomous multifunctional system, integrating Bluetooth, memory chip, and high performance physical sensors. The sensory tag is mounted on a swimming crab (Portunus pelagicus) and is capable of continuous logging of depth, temperature, and salinity within the harsh ocean environment. The fully packaged, ultra-lightweight (<2.4 g in water), and compliant "Marine Skin" system does not have any wired connection enabling safe and weightless cutting-edge approach to monitor and assess marine life and the ecosystem's health to support conservation and management of marine ecosystems.
