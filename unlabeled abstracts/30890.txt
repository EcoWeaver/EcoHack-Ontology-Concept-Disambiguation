Release and establishment ofCotesia flavipesCameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) an exotic parasitoid ofChilo partellus(Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) in East and Southern Africa
Cotesia flavipes Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was first imported into Kenya in 1991 from Pakistan for control of Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). First releases were made at the Kenya coast in 1993 and a few recoveries of the parasitoid were made the following year. Additional foreign exploration for C. flavipes was conducted in central India in 1996 and 1998, which resulted in additional importation of the parasitoid for subsequent releases in eastern and southern Africa. Region-wide releases commenced with releases in Mozambique in 1996, Somalia in 1997 and Uganda in 1998. By 2005, many releases had been made in 10 countries in East and Southern Africa with establishment being reported in all of them except Eritrea but including Ethiopia where releases had never been made. This paper describes the progress made in the release and establishment of C. flavipes in East and Southern Africa and quantifies the rate of spread from the initial release sites in Kenya.
