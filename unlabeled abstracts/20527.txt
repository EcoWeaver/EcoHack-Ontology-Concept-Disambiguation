The mussel Xenostrobus securis: a well-established alien invader in the Ria de Vigo (Spain, NE Atlantic)
Biological and habitat characterization of the non-indigenous invasive species Xenostrobus securis was undertaken in the Ria de Vigo. This study included genetic identification of mussel samples collected from introduced and endemic areas, and the assessment of mussel size, population abundance, geographic distribution, pathological condition, and sediment composition of substrata type. The mussel had a marked patchy distribution, being more abundant in brackish sites with fine sediments and high organic matter content. Pathological analysis revealed that X. securis does not play any role as vector for introducing allochthonous pathogens in the Ria de Vigo. Nevertheless, depending on its invasiveness potential, the mussel could be a key host favouring spreading and epizootic outbreaks of marteliosis which is known to be harmful for local bivalve populations. Phylogenetic analyses of the COI gene placed all the resulting sequences in a clade within the genus Xenostrobus and its phylogeny congruent with an Australian/Pacific origin. The COI tree suggests two historical introductions in European waters. One of these invasions seems to have started in Galicia, moving from there towards Italy and France, while the geographical spread of the second invasion cannot be deciphered, although the Australian/Pacific origin of this invasion seems very possible. The 18S network is congruent with one invasion starting in Galicia or in Italy, as the Australian haplotype is closely related to the haplotype found in these areas. Several hypotheses accounting for the colonization history of this species in Galician waters are discussed. Keywords Xenostrobus securis -Alien-Invader-Ria de Vigo
