The presence of heterospecific males causes an Allee effect
The Allee effect is a positive causal relationship between any component of fitness and population density or size. Allee effects strongly affect the persistence of small or sparse populations. Predicting Allee effects remains a challenge, possibly because not all causal mechanisms are known. We hypothesized that reproductive interference (an interspecific reproductive interaction that reduces the fitness of the species involved) can generate an Allee effect. If the density of the interfering species is constant, an increase in the population of the species receiving interference may dilute the per capita effect of reproductive interference and may generate an Allee effect. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of heterospecific males on the relationship between per capita fecundity and conspecific density in Callosobruchus chinensis and C. maculatus. Of the two species, only C. maculatus females suffer reproductive interference from heterospecific males. Only C. maculatus, the species susceptible to reproductive interference, demonstrated an Allee effect, and only when heterospecific males were present. In contrast, C. chinensis, the species not susceptible to reproductive interference, demonstrated no Allee effect regardless of the presence of heterospecific males. Our results show that reproductive interference in fact generated an Allee effect, suggesting the potential importance of interspecific sexual interactions especially in small or sparse populations, even in the absence of a shared resource. It may be possible to predict Allee effects produced by this mechanism a priori by testing reproductive interference between closely related species.
