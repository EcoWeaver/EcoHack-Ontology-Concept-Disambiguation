Distributional and Host Records of Cerambycidae (Coleoptera) Associated with Cupressaceae in New England, New York, and New Jersey
Eight native and two exotic species of Cerambycidae emerged from dead trunks or occupied pupal cells in live cupressaceous shrubs and trees sampled in New England, New York, and New Jersey between 1998 and 2007. Atimia confusa confusa (Say) developed in three hosts collected in one or more of seven states; Callidiellum rufipenne (Motschulsky) in nine hosts in five states; Callidium frigidum Casey in five hosts in eight states; Neoclytus acuminatus acuminatus (Fabricius) in four hosts in five states; and Semanotus ligneus ligneus (Fabricius) in two hosts in Connecticut. Other species that developed exclusively in Juniperus virginiana Linnaeus were Callidium violaceum Linnaeus collected in Maine and New Jersey; Curius dentatus Newman in New Jersey; Oeme rigida rigida (Say) in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey; Tilloclytus geminatus (Haldeman) in New Jersey; and Urgleptes querci (Fitch) in Connecticut. Overall 5,806 cerambycids developed to adults in four native and six introduced species of Cupressaceae. New distributional and host records are discussed.
