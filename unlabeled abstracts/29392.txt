Are Unsuccessful Avian Invaders Rarer in Their Native Range Than Successful Invaders?
Biological invasions are a central component of the increasing taxonomic and geographic homogenization of the biosphere (Vitousek et. al., 1996), but our ability to predict such invasions remains in its infancy (Gilpin, 1990). A number of reviews (e.g., Ehrlich, 1986, 1989; Pimm, 1989; Lodge, 1993; Williamson, 1996) have listed the factors which may bias a species towards becoming a successful invader, including being abundant, widespread, and generalist. For example, Moulton and Pimm (1986) showed that large range size increased the chance of successful introduction into Hawai'i by passerine birds, and Scott and Panetta (1993) made a similar case for invasive plants in South Africa. Roy et. al. (1991) found a positive correlation between habitat generalism (measured by the number of climate zones within a species' native range) of biome grasses and number of continents invaded. Most recently, Goodwin et. al. (1999) found number of native biogeographic regions to be the best predictor of successful plant invasion into New Brunswick, Canada.
