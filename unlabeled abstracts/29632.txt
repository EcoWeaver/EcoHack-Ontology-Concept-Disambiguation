Variations in piscivory of invasive largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides associated with pond environments
Introductions of non-native predatory fishes can be a major driver of aquatic biodiversity loss. The largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides (L.) has been introduced throughout much of the world, thereafter negatively affecting native faunal communities owing to its predatory impact. To investigate the environmental factors affecting the predatory performance of invasive bass, we examined the stomach contents and habitat characteristics of bass in 15 irrigation farm ponds in northeastern Japan. The food habits of the bass populations differed among the studied ponds: the predominant prey items were fishes among bass in seven of the ponds, whereas aquatic invertebrates (mainly insects and zooplankton) were the predominant taxa in the diets of bass in the eight remaining ponds, with the onset of piscivory related to body size. The results of multivariate analysis indicated that the extent to which the bass consumed fish was positively associated with fish prey abundance and negatively associated with percentage of aquatic vegetation coverage. We suggest that the extent of aquatic vegetation coverage strongly influenced the predation efficiency of bass in the ponds. These findings might be employed to assess a pond ecosystem's vulnerability to invasive largemouth bass and to reduce the predator's impact on native fish species by improvements to the habitat.
