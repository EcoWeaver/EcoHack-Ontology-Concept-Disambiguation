The occurrence of a widespread marine invader, Didemnum perlucidum (Tunicata, Ascidiacea) in Western Australia
Colonial ascidians of the genus Didemnum are emerging as potent invaders of coastal marine ecosystems. Here, we used taxonomic and phylogenetic approaches to confirm the presence of Didemnum perlucidum in Australia. D. perlucidum is widespread in tropical ports and is thought to be a recent introduction into Brazilian waters, where it has increased biofouling pressure and affected aquaculture practices. D. perlucidum was observed dominating fouling assemblages on settlement panels and jetty pylons at two study sites in the Perth metropolitan area, Western Australia. As identifying members of this genus based on morphological characteristics is difficult, analysis of mtDNA was conducted to verify the occurrence of D. perlucidum in Australia. Space occupation of artificial substrata was observed in summer and autumn, when D. perlucidum colonies overgrew other sessile organisms, including the commercially harvested Blue Mussel (Mytilus edulis ssp. planulatus). This represents the first confirmed record of this species in Australia, which should be considered cryptogenic until detailed biogeographical analyses are conducted. The distribution, biology, and economic and ecological implications of D. perlucidum in Australia are entirely unknown, and warrant urgent investigation.
