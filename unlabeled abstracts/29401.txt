Frontier population dynamics of an invasive squirrel species: Do introduced populations function differently than those in the native range?
Several squirrel species are biological invaders and their establishment in an area is often marked by ecological and economic costs to native species and forest crops. The eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis Gmelin 1788) has been intentionally introduced multiple times outside of its native range but its success in establishing and spreading has not been consistent. An intensive live-trapping programme was designed to investigate the demography and population dynamics of populations of this species on the invasion frontier in the Republic of Ireland, a region marked by the slow but steady invasion of the grey squirrel. Low densities and high breeding rates distinguished these frontier populations. These results were placed in context with other frontier and established grey squirrel populations throughout their introduced and native ranges. As expected, variations in invasion speed and impact severity between regions were reflected in population demography. The highest densities, survival rates and breeding rates were recorded in Britain where the grey squirrel invasion has been most damaging. Careful comparative demographic study of invading populations could improve management outcomes, indicate differential invasibility of invaded communities, and offer clues to enhance the design of conservation reintroduction projects.
