Geographic trend in sexual size dimorphism and body size of Osteopilus septentrionalis (Cuban treefrog): implications for invasion of the southeastern United States
We collected Osteopilusseptentrionalis from Central Florida for analysis of sexual size dimorphism and compared our data to published information from populations across the native and introduced range of the species. We found significant sexual size dimorphism (females larger), with the degree of dimorphism decreasing with increasing degrees north latitude, a trend largely driven by a pronounced decrease in female mean snout to vent length. Potential explanations for this trend include reduced growth rates, increased time to maturity, and reduced life expectancy, all of which may be tied to climatic variation. A trend of decreasing female mean size toward the northernmost extent of the current introduced range of this species may be indicative of diminished impacts and invasive success. Geographical variation in morphology and its associated implications should be evaluated when considering the potential impacts of invasive species.
