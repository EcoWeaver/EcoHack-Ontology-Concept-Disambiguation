Massive settlements of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, in Scandinavia
The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is an important aquaculture species world-wide. Due to its wide environmental tolerance and high growth rate, it has also become a successful invader in many areas, leading to major ecosystem changes. Low water temperatures were previously believed to restrict the establishment of Pacific oysters in Scandinavia. However, recent surveys reveal that the Pacific oyster is now established in many areas in Scandinavia. We present data on the current distribution, abundance and age-structure in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. The biomass of oysters in the Danish Wadden Sea increased from 1,056 to 6,264 tonnes between 2005 and 2007. Massive settlements were observed along the Swedish west coast in 2007, with densities >400 oysters per m-2. In Norway, populations are established on the southern coast, and specimens have been found as far north as 60degN. The potential impacts and probable causes of this recent large-scale establishment are discussed. Keywords Crassostrea gigas -Invasive species-Recruitment-Scandinavia-Water temperature
