Natural Dyes from Three Invasive Plant Species in The United States
Natural dyes from invasive plant species may serve as reliable, nontoxic, replicable alternatives to synthetic dyes. Novel approaches to invasive species control aids in restoration, incentivizes commercial uses, and results in large-scale removal with improved biodiversity. The purpose of the study was to test the dye effectiveness of three invasive plant species on organic cotton and wool for outdoor apparel in colorfastness to wet and dry crocking, perspiration, laundering, and antimicrobial action against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aspergillus Niger. Invasive plant roots used to dye were: Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii), wineberry (Rubus phoenicolasius), and oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus). Mordants [Red oak acorn (Quercus rubra), acetate, and alum] expedited dyeing and fixation. Color intensity was measured using L*, a*, b*, and E* values. Wool morphology produced better coloration. Barberry showed the most promising antimicrobial properties on cotton even though there was dye migration during wet crocking, perspiration, and laundering. The resulting earth tones and fabric weight are ideal for outdoor furniture or winter apparel.
