Complete mitochondrial genome of the invasive semi-aquatic mammal, nutria Myocastor coypus (Rodentia; Myocastoridae)
The nutria or coypu (Myocastor coypus, Molina, 1782) is one of the world's worst invasive alien species. Nutria have significant harmful effects on natural ecosystems and agricultural industries on a global scale, including in South Korea. Herein, we report the complete mitochondrial genome of M. coypus. The 16,874 bp sequenced genome exhibited a typical rodential mitochondrial gene arrangement, and consisted of the typical set of 37 genes, one replication origin, and a D-loop. The mitogenome of nutria displayed the highest similarity with that of Cuvier's spiny rat, Proechimys cuvieri, and was distinct from that of the house mouse, Mus musculus. Multigene phylogenetic analysis also revealed that M. coypus was well clustered with other species in Myocastorini, and the overall tree topology accorded well with recent molecular phylogenetic analysis of South American spiny rats. The results will provide information fundamental for the scientific management of the nutria populations in South Korea.
