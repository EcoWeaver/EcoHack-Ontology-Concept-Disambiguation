Effect of introduced species and habitat alteration on the occurrence and distribution of euryhaline fishes in fresh- and brackish-water habitats on Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao (South Caribbean)
We conducted an ichthyological survey during the dry season of 2006 on the semi-arid islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao to provide information on species composition, richness and dis-tribution in natural and non-natural aquatic habitats. The dry season species assemblages (N = 9 species) comprised less spe-cies than the wet seasons, and these data refi ne our knowledge of the indigenous fi sh fauna and its refuge localities during phases of drought and ensuing high salinity. A hierarchical cluster analysis reveals that the three islands have different spe-cies compositions with Curacao being the most diverse, probably due to its having the most habitats and freshwaters present throughout the year. Species richness was unrelated to salinity and species diversity was highest in canalised streams. In the dry season fewer amphidromous species are present than in the wet season. We found no signifi cant effect of human-induced changes on the presence or absence of fi sh species in the Nether-lands Antilles. The presence of exotic species (including Xipho-phorus helleri on Aruba, a fi rst record for this island, and Oreo-chromis mossambicus and Poecilia reticulata occurring on all three islands) did not have a clear effect on the presence of in-digenous species, nor did human alteration of the habitats have an infl uence on the occurrence of fi sh species.
