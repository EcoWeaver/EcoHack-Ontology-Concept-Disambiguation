Manipulating disturbance regimes and seeding to restore mesic Mediterranean grasslands
Question: Can managing disturbance regimes alone or in combination with seeding native species serve to shift the balance from exotic towards native species? Location: Central coast of California, USA. Methods: We measured vegetation composition for 10 yr in a manipulative experiment replicated at three sites. Treatments included no disturbance, grazing and clipping at three frequencies with and without litter removal. We seeded eight native species into clipped plots and compared cover in comparable plots with no seeding. Results: Regardless of frequency, clipping generally shifted community dominance from exotic annual grasses to exotic annual forbs, rather than consistently favoring native species. At one site, perennial grass cover decreased in no-disturbance plots, but only after 4 yr. Litter removal had minimal impact on litter depth and plant community composition. Grazing had a highly variable effect on the abundance of different plant guilds across sites and years. Seeding increased abundance of only two of eight native species. Conclusions: Managing disturbance regimes alone is insufficient to restore native species guilds in highly-invaded grasslands and seeding native species has highly variable success.
