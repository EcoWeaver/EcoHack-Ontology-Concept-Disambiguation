Predicting possible negative impacts of weed biocontrol by artificially suppressing invasive hawkweed in New Zealand's tussock grasslands
To test the theory that successful biocontrol of invasive hawkweeds (Pilosella and Hieracium spp.) would increase bare ground and accelerate erosion, small areas of hawkweed were suppressed with herbicide in a nine-year study. An increase in bare ground resulting from the treatments was maintained throughout. No new invasive species were recorded, and apart from a temporary increase in a perennial grass, no existing exotic species moved into the gaps created. Indigenous plants did not respond either, although at one site where mat plants were prevalent, treatments slowed their decline. As recovery of existing vegetation was minimal, it is likely that invasion of hawkweed is a consequence of degradation rather than the reverse, and if biocontrol is successful, degraded grasslands may suffer further damage, especially in areas that are grazed. The effect may be ameliorated since biocontrol agents are predicted to perform less well under conditions of low fertility and low moisture. Our results emphasize the importance of pre-release ecological studies to clarify the role of invasive plants proposed for biocontrol.
