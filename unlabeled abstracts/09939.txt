Stochasticity, invasions, and branching random walks.
We link deterministic integrodifference equations to stochastic, individual-based simulations by means of branching random walks. Using standard methods, we determine speeds of invasion for both average densities and furthest-forward individuals. For density-independent branching random walks, demographic stochasticity can produce extinction. Demographic stochasticity does not, however, reduce the overall asymptotic speed of invasion or preclude continually accelerating invasions.
