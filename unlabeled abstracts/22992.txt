Assessment of Fragmentation and Disturbance Patterns in Eastern Ghats: A Case Study in R.V. Nagar Range, Visakhapatnam District, Andhra Pradesh, India
At present the biodiversity in Eastern Ghats is threatened by loss of habitats, exploitation and unscientific management of natural resources, forest fire, biological invasion and other anthropogenic pressures. In this context, we have assessed the forest cover changes, fragmentation and disturbance in the R.V. Nagar Range of Eastern Ghats region, Andhra Pradesh using satellite remote sensing and GIS techniques. Satellite data of IRS-1A LISS II of 1988 and IRS-P6 LISS III of 2006 were assessed for forest cover changes in 1 sq.km grid and generated as Sensitivity Index map. Further the road and settlement buffer of 1000m was generated to represent Threat Index map. From 1988 to 2006, the forest cover had a total cover loss of 35.2 sq.km and increase in scrub cover by 7.2%. Over all change analysis from 1988 to 2006 with reference to forest cover indicates, negative changes (loss of forest area) accounted for 48.1 sq.km area and positive changes (gain of forest) for an area of 12.1 sq.km of area. The results of the change detection using multi-date satellite imagery suggest degradation in forest cover over two decades, which necessitates the conservation measures in this range with high priority.
