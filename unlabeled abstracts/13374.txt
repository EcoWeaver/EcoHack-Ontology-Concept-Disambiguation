Across-population variation in sex ratio in invasive Japanese Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Caenogastropoda: Rissooidea: Hydrobiidae)
Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a well-known invasive species, has both sexual and asexual forms in its native area, and is generally asexual in exotic areas. pot-amopyrgus antipodarum was sampled from ten locations in central and western Japan, and the sex distribution was analyzed. Males were found in two of the ten localities; the percentages of males in these localities were 7 .2 arrd'l .3 Vo, which is within the range of that observed in asexual populations in native and introduced areas. A flow cytometry analysis showed that populations with a low percentage of males (Kanro) and populations consisting only of females (Banyu Park, Hadano and Yugawara) and perhaps the population reported as having a high male percentage in a previous study (Chiba;29.8 Vo) were trip-loid. Males from Chiba and Kanro produced sperm. Most of the females from Chiba stored sperm in their seminal receptacle, showing that they had copulated, but no females from Kanro stored sperm. Fertilization by males, normal development of fertilized eggs, and the fecundity ofjuve-niles should be evaluated in further studies to demonstrate the sexual reproduction of P. antipodarum in Japan.
