Differences in longitudinal distribution patterns along a Honshu stream of brown trout Salmo trutta, white-spotted charr Salvelinus leucomaenis and masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou
Brown trout Salmo trutta were first introduced into Japan in 1892, and they currently naturally reproduce in several rivers in Honshu and Hokkaido, Japan. Although negative impacts of brown trout introductions on native salmonid fishes have been documented in some Hokkaido rivers, studies of ecological interactions between brown trout and native salmonid fishes on Honshu are limited. In this study, we describe the longitudinal distribution patterns of introduced brown trout, white-spotted charr Salvelinus leucomaenis and masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou in a 4km stretch of a stream in central Honshu. Underwater observations were conducted in all pools within upstream, middle and downstream sections (190-400m in length) of this stretch in order to estimate the densities of these species. Only white-spotted charr was observed in the upstream section, while brown trout and masu salmon were observed in the middle and downstream sections. Masu salmon densities, however, were much lower than brown trout densities. In the downstream section, white-spotted charr was absent. These results are consistent with results from previous studies of Hokkaido rivers, where it was found that white-spotted charr in low-gradient areas tend to be displaced by brown trout.
