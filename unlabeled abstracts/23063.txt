Genetic variability of feral and ranch American minkNeovison vison in Poland
The diversity of 11 microsatellite loci was examined to estimate the genetic variability of ranch and feral American mink Neovison vison (Schreber, 1777) in Poland. Samples were collected from 10 mink farms (182 individuals) and from 5 areas in the north-eastern part of the country (87 individuals). At each examined locus the observed heterozygosity (Ho) was lower than the expected heterozygosity (He). Feral mink showed lower genetic variability than ranch mink; however, in the former group the mean value of the inbreeding coefficient (FIS=0.306) was higher than in the latter (0.242). These results demonstrated that feral and ranch mink belong to two genetically close but separate groups. Genetic differences were identified between mink colour breeds but not between animals from particular farms. The height of the modal values of DK indicated the presence of four genetic clusters: (1) farmed mink sapphire, (2) farmed mink standard and pastel, (3) farmed mink pearl and (4) feral mink. Assignment of mink individuals using assignment test, STRUCTURE and GeneClass 2.0. revealed that 12-16% of the feral mink group are likely to be ranch mink escapees. It may be concluded that approximately 30 years after the start of the expansion of feral mink in north-eastern Poland, this wild-living population exists without a major input of individuals bred on fur farms.
