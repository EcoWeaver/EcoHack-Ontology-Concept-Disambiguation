Phytoremediation applications in natural condition and in mesocosm: The uptake of cadmium by Lemna minuta Kunth, a non-native species in Italian watercourses
Metal pollution in water and soil is an environmental and public health issue. Cadmium is included in the list of priority hazardous substances in the European Water Framework Directive. Phytoremediation system is a cost-effective plant-based approach that takes advantage of the ability of plants to concentrate elements and compounds from the environment and to metabolize various molecules in their tissues. We studied the presence and the importance of an invasive species, such as Lemna minuta, in the environment and the effects of Cd pollution on this species. Growth, removal and tolerance were evaluated for different Cd concentration and different time of plant exposure. In the whole, the results show that L. minuta has a good capacity of growth, metal bioconcentration, and tolerance up to 3 days of exposure at 0.5 and 1.5 mg L-1 of Cd. In particular, L. minuta was able to accumulate Cd up to 3771 mg Kg-1 on dry mass basis. We can conclude that L. minuta possesses a great capability of Cd absorption and accumulation, thus supporting a potential use of this species in designing of a metal bioremediation system in phytoremediation field.
