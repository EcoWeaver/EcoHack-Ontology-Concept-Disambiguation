Exotic Species in the Great Lakes: A History of Biotic Crises and Anthropogenic Introductions
Since the 1800s, 139 non-indigenous aquatic organisms have become established in the Great Lakes. The bulk of these organisms has been represented by plants (50), fishes (25), algae (24), and mollusks (14). Most species are native to Eurasia (55%) and the Atlantic Coast (13%). As human activity has increased in the Great Lakes watershed, the rate of introduction of exotic species has increased. Almost 1/3 of the organisms have been introduced in the past 30 yr, a surge coinciding with the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959. Five categories of entry mechanisms were identified: unintentional releases, ship-related introductions, deliverate releases, entry through or along canals, and movement along railroads and highways. Entry mechanisms were dominated by unintentional releases (29%) and ships (29%). Unintentional releasees included escapees from cultivation and aquaculture, bait, aquarium, and other accidental releases. Ship-related introductions included ballast water (63%), solid ballast (31%), and fouling. Introductions via canals represent a small percentage of entries into the Great Lakes. Thirteen non-indigenous species (9%) have substantially influenced the Great Lakes ecosystem, both economically and ecologically. -from Authors
