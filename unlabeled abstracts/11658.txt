Habitat and climatic preferences drive invasions of non-native ambrosia beetles in deciduous temperate forests
The introduction of non-native ambrosia beetles can cause severe damage in forest ecosystems. Understanding the environmental drivers affecting their invasion at the local scale is of utmost importance to enhancing management strategies. Our objectives were: i) to determine the influence of forest composition, forest structure, and climate on invasion success of non-native ambrosia beetles in deciduous temperate forests, and ii) to test the effect of host tree species on colonization success by non-native ambrosia beetles. In 2013, we sampled 25 forest stands located in North-East Italy belonging to three forest types dominated respectively by hop hornbeam, chestnut, and beech. Both ethanol-baited traps and trap-logs of five tree species (hop hornbeam, chestnut, beech, manna ash and black locust) were used to sample non-native and native ambrosia beetle communities. We found a clear effect of forest composition on non-native species richness and activity-density, as measured in ethanol-baited traps, both of which were higher in chestnut-dominated forests. Furthermore, we found a positive effect of temperature on both the number of trapped non-native species and their activity-density, with cold temperatures limiting beetle spread in high-elevation forests. Only Xylosandrus germanus successfully colonized the trap-logs. The number of colonized logs was higher for chestnut and in chestnut-dominated forests. Both trapping and log-baiting indicated that chestnut-dominated forests were at greater risk of invasion than hop hornbeam- and beech-dominated forests. Given the economic and ecological importance of chestnut, ambrosia beetle communities present in chestnut-dominated forests should be monitored to determine where protective measures must be taken.
