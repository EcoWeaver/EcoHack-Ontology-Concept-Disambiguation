Capacity for clonal integration in introduced versus native clones of the invasive plant Hydrocotyle vulgaris
Clonal plants can make up a disproportionately high number of the introduced, invasive plant species in a region. Physiological integration of connected ramets within clones is a key ecological advantage of clonal growth. To ask whether clonal integration underlies the invasiveness of clonal plants, we tested the hypothesis that introduced clones of an invasive species will show higher capacity for integration than native clones of the same species. We conduct a greenhouse experiment on the widespread, perennial herb Hydrocotyle vulgaris. Clonal fragments consisting of pairs of connected ramets from seven sites in northwestern Spain where the species is native and seven sites in southeastern China where the species is introduced and invasive were grown for 79 days with the younger, apical ramet shaded to 30% of ambient light and the connection between ramets either severed or left intact. Severance decreased the final dry mass and ramet number of the apical ramet and its offspring in nearly all clones and increased the mass or ramet number of the basal portion of the fragment in about half of the clones, but these effects did not differ consistently between native and introduced clones. Severance did affect allocation more in introduced than in native clones, decreasing root/total mass more in apical portions and increasing it more in basal portions. Maintaining the connection between ramets caused introduced, but not native, clonal fragments to produce more leaf and less root mass and thus to lower allocation to roots. Regardless of severance, introduced clones accumulated about twice as much mass as native clones. Results suggest that introduced clones of a species can show greater effects of integration on allocation than native clones. In species such as H. vulgaris, this might increase competitiveness for light.
