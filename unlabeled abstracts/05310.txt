Bacterial invasion potential in water is determined by nutrient availability and the indigenous community.
In drinking water and the distribution systems, bacterial growth and biofilm formation has to be controlled both for limiting taste or odour development and preventing clogging or bio-corrosion problems. After a contamination with undesired bacteria, factors like nutrient availability and temperature will influence the survival these invaders. Understanding the conditions enabling invaders to proliferate is essential for a holistic approach towards microbial risk assessment in drinking water. Pseudomonas putida was used as a model invader since this easy growing bacterium can use a wide range of substrates. Invasion experiments in oligo- to eutrophic waters showed the requirement of both a carbon and phosphate source for survival of P. putida in drinking water. Addition of C, N and P enabled P. putida to grow in drinking water from 5.80 x 10(4) cells.mL(-1) to 1.84 x 10(8) cells.mL(-1) and survive for at least 12 days. However, in surface water with similar nutrient concentrations, P. putida did not survive, indicating the concomitant importance of the present indigenous microbial community of the specific water sample. Either extensive carbon or phosphate limitation can be used in water treatment design in order to obtain a drinking water which is not susceptible for unwanted bacterial growth.
