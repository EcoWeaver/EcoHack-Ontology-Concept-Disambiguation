Discovery of Trichoferus campestris (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in Ontario, Canada and first host record in North America
Introductions of some forest invasive alien species result in important economic, environmental, and ecological impacts. One approach used by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to improve the detection of these species is to collect logs from trees in declining health at high risk sites of introduction and to incubate them to obtain insects, if present. Trichoferus campestris (Faldermann) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) adults emerged, and live larvae were extracted, from one of two logs taken from a dying Norway maple, Acer platanoides Linnaeus (Sapindaceae), in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. In its native range, eastern Asia, this beetle is polyphagous, however, in North America there is no host record despite numerous interceptions of larvae in wood packaging material and captures of adults at various post-entry sites. An examination of the feeding damage caused by T. campestris in that maple suggests this insect is not a primary pest of trees in Ontario.
