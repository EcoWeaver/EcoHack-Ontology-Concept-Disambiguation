Brain transcriptome analysis reveals gene expression differences associated with dispersal behaviour between range-front and range-core populations of invasive cane toads in Australia
Understanding the mechanisms underlying rapid adaptation of invasive species in novel environments is key to improving our ability to manage these species. Many invaders demonstrate rapid evolution of behavioural traits involved in range expansion such as locomotor activity, exploration and risk-taking. However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin these changes are poorly understood. In 86 years, invasive cane toads ( Rhinella marina ) in Australia have drastically expanded their geographic range westward from coastal Queensland to Western Australia. During their range expansion, toads have undergone extensive phenotypic changes, particularly in behaviours that enhance the toads' dispersal ability. Common-garden experiments have shown that some changes in behavioural traits related to dispersal are heritable. However, genetic diversity is greatly reduced across the invasive range due to a strong founder effect, and the genetic basis underlying dispersal-related behavioural changes remains unknown. Here we used RNA-seq to compare the brain transcriptomes of toads from the Hawai'ian source population, as well as three distinct populations from across the Australian invasive range. We found markedly different gene expression profiles between the source population and Australian toads. By contrast, cane toads from across the Australian invasive range had very similar transcriptomic profiles. Yet, key genes with functions putatively related to dispersal behaviour showed differential expression between range-core and range-front populations. These genes could play an important role in the behavioural changes characteristic of range expansion in Australian cane toads.
