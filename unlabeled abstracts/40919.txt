Invasion of an intermediate predator: Fish population dynamics in a mathematical model of a trophic chain (As applied to Syamozero lake)
We present a mathematical model of the dynamics of a spatially heterogeneous predator-prey population system. A prototype of the model system is the Syamozero lake fish community. We study the impact of the invader, an intermediate predator, on the dynamics of the fish community. We show that the invasion can lead to the appearance of chaotic oscillations in the population density. We show also that different dynamical regimes resulting from the invasion, i.e., stationary, non-chaotic oscillatory and chaotic ones, can coexist. The "choice" of a specific regime therewith depends on the initial invader density. Our analysis of solutions of the mathematical models shows that the successful invasion of the alien species takes place solely in the absence of the competition between the invaders and the native species.
