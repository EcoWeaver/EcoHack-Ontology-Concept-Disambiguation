Above-ground biomass estimates for invasive trees and shrubs in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso, Brazil
Above-ground biomass of four common invasive tree and shrub species in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso, Brazil, was determined from harvested specimens. Regression analysis of the dry weights of stem, branch, leaf, and total biomass versus basal area at breast height or at ground level, and versus basal area and total plant height, was used to calculate regression equations of the form Y = aXb. All correlations of the logarithmically transformed values were highly significant (P < 0.001), but were slightly better for woody and total biomass than for leaf biomass. Differences in the regression curves between species are explained by particular growth habits or canopy structure. Basal area, derived from the diameter at breast height (DBH) or diameter at ground level, was found to be the most simple and yet most valuable predictor for woody and total biomass.
