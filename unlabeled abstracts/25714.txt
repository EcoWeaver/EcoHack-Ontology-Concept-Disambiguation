Can R*s Predict Invasion in Semi-arid Grasslands?
We estimated R*s and tested the applicability of R* theory on nonindigenous plant invasions in semi-arid rangeland. R* is the concentration of a resource that a species requires to survive in a habitat. R* theory predicts that a species with a lower R* for the most limiting resource will competitively displace a species with a higher R* under equilibrium conditions. In a greenhouse, annual sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), bluebunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum Pursh), and spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa Lam.) were grown in monoculture and 2- and 3-species mixtures for three growth periods in an attempt to reduce soil NO3-N concentrations below each species' R*. At the end of each growth period, aboveground biomass by species and soil plant available nitrogen were sampled. Decreasing biomass coupled with decreasing soil plant available nitrogen was used to quantify R*s for the three species. R*s for annual sunflower, bluebunch wheatgrass, and spotted knapweed were estimated to be 0.6+-0.16 ppm NO 3-, less than 0.05 ppm NO 3-, and 0.6+-0.13 ppm NO 3-, respectively. Estimated R*s did not predict the outcome of competition among species. To successfully predict plant community dynamics on semi-arid rangeland with and without the presence of a nonindigenous invasive species, a more comprehensive model that includes mechanisms in addition to competition may have to be considered. We speculate that R* theory may prove most useful for predicting the outcome of competition within functional groups.
