Seasonality and host utilization of the invasive fruit fly, Bactrocera invadens (Dipt., Tephritidae) in central Tanzania
  The temporal occurrence of the invasive and economically important pest fruit fly, Bactrocera invadens was studied in three agro-ecological areas of Morogoro Region, central Tanzania, during 2004-2005. Weekly and monthly trappings were carried out with methyl eugenol, protein bait and synthetic food attractant. Bactrocera invadens was permanently present at low and mid-altitudes (380-520 m a.s.l.) with peak periods coinciding with the fruiting season of mango (Mangifera indica) and guava (Psidium guajava). At high altitude (1650 m a.s.l.) its incidence was only temporal and apparently the result of dispersal from lower altitudes after the mango fruiting season. Rearing results showed mango, loquat (Eriobotrya japonica), guava and grapefruit (Citrus x paradisi) to be the favoured commercial host fruits. Other Citrus species, cucurbits, papaya (Carica papaya) and avocado (Persea americana) were less favoured.
