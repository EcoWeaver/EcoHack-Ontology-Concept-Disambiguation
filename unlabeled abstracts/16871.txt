Spread of Drosophila suzukii in orchards of Crete
This paper presents the occurrence of high populations of the spotted wing drosophila fly, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera; Drosophilidae) in various regions of the Western part of Crete, Municipality of Chania. Clusters of berries of its perennial host pokeweed, Phytolacca americana (Caryophyllates: Phytolaccacae) were collected from olive and citrus orchards of several areas of Chania, in early winter of 2014. A total number of 440 D. suzukii adults were collected in 10 out of 13 studied areas. The pest was distributed along the coastland near the seaport of Souda which may represent the route of entry for this pest in Chania as well as a spreading pathway from or to the other neighboring prefectures of Crete (Rethymno, Iraklio, Lasithi). This study documents the presence and spread of high populations of D. suzukii in regions where its cultivated host plants do not exist, with its confirmed and predicted distribution. (c) 2016 E.
