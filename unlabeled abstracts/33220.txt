IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF FIRE ON THE INVASIVE ARGENTINE ANT, LINEPITHEMA HUMILE
To examine how fire affects the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, I used pitfall traps to estimate worker abundance immediately prior to and for approximately 3 months after a controlled burn in a northern California grassland. I found that L. humile abundance per trap was, on average, 75% lower after the fire than before the fire.
