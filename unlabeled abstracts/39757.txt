Interactive effects of urbanization and year on invasive and native ant diversity of sacred groves of South India
Urbanization is a major threat to native biodiversity. Invasion of tramp species is a major consequence of urbanization, which might threaten native species. Ants are established robust ecosystem indicators. We assessed the changes of ant community in sacred groves (SGs) of urban and rural landscapes of south India between 2013 and 2019, and asked, 1) what is the effect of urbanization on ant community? 2) has the population of invasive ants, particularly Anoplolepis gracilipes - a globally notorious tramp species, changed in response to urbanization and year? 3) is species composition of ants in SGs different between landscapes and years? and 4) has the population of native ants or any ant functional groups responded with the population of invasive ants? The richness of overall species, native species, and invasive species was not affected by year or landscape, but the abundance was. In six years, the abundance of ants doubled, but due to A. gracilipes. A. gracilipes, previously restricted only in the urban SGs had established in rural SGs in six years. A significant turnover of native species was observed across years and with the population rise of A. gracilipes. While Generalist Myrmecines and Tropical Climate Specialists increased with the abundance of invasive ants, Cryptic Species decreased. We consider the stability maintained in the native species composition and richness in SGs, the aftermath of the conditions provided by SGs. However, the evident shift in the composition of native ants over the years point out how invasive ants affect the native species composition.
