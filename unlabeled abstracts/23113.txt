Myrmica specioides Bondroit: a new invasive ant species in the USA?
Ants are among the most successful invasive species. The establishment of the infamous red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta (Fabricius) has caused a considerable amount of damage to both the economy and the native ecosystem of the Southern United States. We report the first record of a newly introduced ant species, Myrmica specioides Bondroit, to the state of Washington. It possesses the characteristics of a potential pest ant: high aggressiveness, polygyny, and the tendency to reach high local abundances. This early record might facilitate the control of introduced populations before they can develop into a genuine nuisance.
