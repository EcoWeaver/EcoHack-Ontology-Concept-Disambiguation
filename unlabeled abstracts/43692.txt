Application Natura 2000 Data For The Invasive Plants Spread Prediction*
Abstract The distribution of invasive plants depends on several environmental factors, e.g. on the distance from the vector of spreading, invaded community composition, land-use, etc. The species distribution models, a research tool for invasive plants spread prediction, involve the combination of environmental factors, occurrence data, and statistical approach. For the construction of the presented distribution model, the occurrence data on invasive plants (Solidago sp., Fallopia sp., Robinia pseudoaccacia, and Heracleum mantegazzianum) and Natura 2000 habitat types from the Protected Landscape Area Kokorinsko have been intersected in ArcGIS and statistically analyzed. The data analysis was focused on (1) verification of the accuracy of the Natura 2000 habitat map layer, and the accordance with the habitats occupied by invasive species and (2) identification of a suitable scale of intersection between the habitat and species distribution. Data suitability was evaluated for the construction of the model on local scale. Based on the data, the invaded habitat types were described and the optimal scale grid was evaluated. The results show the suitability of Natura 2000 habitat types for modelling, however more input data (e.g. on soil types, elevation) are needed.
