Modelling the dynamics of invasion and control of competing green crab genotypes
Establishment of invasive species is a worldwide problem. In many jurisdictions, management strategies are being developed in an attempt to reduce the environmental and economic harm these species may cause in the receiving ecosystem. Scientific studies to improve understanding of the mechanisms behind invasive species population growth and spread are key components in the development of control methods. The work presented herein is motivated by the case of the European green crab (Carcinus maenas L.), a remarkably adaptable organism that has invaded marine coastal waters around the globe. Two genotypes of European green crab have independently invaded the Atlantic coast of Canada. One genotype invaded the mid-Atlantic coast of the USA by 1817, subsequently spreading northward through New England and reaching Atlantic Canada by 1951. A second genotype, originating from the northern limit of the green crabs European range, invaded the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia in the 1980s and is spreading southward from the Canadian Maritime provinces. We developed an integrodifference equation model for green crab population growth, competition and spread, and demonstrate that it yields appropriate spread rates for the two genotypes, based on historical data. Analysis of our model indicates that while harvesting efforts have the benefit of reducing green crab density and slowing the spread rate of the two genotypes, elimination of the green crab is virtually impossible with harvesting alone. Accordingly, a green crab fishery would be sustainable. We also demonstrate that with harvesting and restocking, the competitive imbalance between the Northern and Southern green crab genotypes can be reversed. That is, a competitively inferior species can be used to control a competitively superior one.
