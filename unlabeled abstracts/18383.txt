The origin and genetic variability of the Czech sika deer population
Sika deer (Cervus nippon), native to Asia, formed two well-established free-living populations in the Czech Republic over the last century and continue to spread. Sika are also maintained in a large number of enclosures; these continue to introduce new individuals from the places of its origin as well as from other European countries. Despite extensive research into the morphology and ethology of the Czech sika deer, conducted over the last three decades, no study using genetic methods has been done. This study aimed to determine the genetic variability and the geographic origin of the Czech sika deer population. Two mitochondrial markers, the cytochrome b and the control region were analyzed in this study. Analysis of the two markers confirmed that the founder individuals of the Czech population originated from both native island (Japanese Islands) and native mainland (Far East Russia) populations. Results showed that the genetic variability of the Czech sika deer population is lower than the variability of the native Japanese population, but higher than that of the sampled part of the native Russian population. Also, the genetic variability was found to be higher within the samples from enclosures.
