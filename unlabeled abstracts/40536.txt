The current invasion status of Anodonta woodiana (Lea, 1934) in Poland -- study of habitat parameters
The study of fish ponds have confirmed the presence of nine new locations of Anodonta woodiana in Poland, with strong and vital populations. These are examples of Chinese pond mussels accidentally introduced along with fish imports. Comparison of known localities shows that more mussels are in eastern Poland, from which the migration path of A. woodiana progresses. Most often mussels settle in larger water reservoirs with elongated shapes. Older and longer mussels occur in deeper fish ponds. Moreover, the further south the location, the higher biomass can be obtained. The average age of mussels in a fish pond depends on its bed type and depth; however the latter has less influence. New locations of this species are also to be expected due to deliberate introduction; cases of resettlement of individual specimens of the Chinese pond mussel to new locations have been recorded.
