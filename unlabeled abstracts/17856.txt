Is there a role for freshwater protected areas in the conservation of migratory fish?
Migratory fish have been declining in number as a result of numerous processes including hydropower development, pollution, invasive species, and climate change. Migratory fish are important ecosystem components, and yet there are many gaps in our knowledge of migratory fish life history and their relationship with hydrological processes. Consequently, few mechanisms are available to promote their conservation. An emergent tool is the Freshwater Protected Area (FPA), a zone of restricted use and access within freshwater systems analogous to terrestrial or marine protected areas that aim to conserve constituent resources. These protected areas are often criticized for their inability to control pollution inputs and their tendency to be implemented only as components of terrestrial parks, meaning that they traditionally do not reflect the importance of aquatic systems or promote connectivity. This paper reassesses FPAs in the context of migratory fish conservation and addresses a variety of obstacles inhibiting FPAs from being suitable for protecting migratory fishes. Developing FPAs that encompass critical life-stage habitat for migratory species, such as spawning and nursery areas, migratory corridors, and feeding zones, is essential for ensuring ample interconnected habitat for migratory fishes to thrive and ecological and evoluitonary processes to occur.
