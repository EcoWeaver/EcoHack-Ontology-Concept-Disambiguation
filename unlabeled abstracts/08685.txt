Rise of Invasive Species Denialism? A Response to Russell and Blackburn.
In their article claiming a rise of invasive species denialism, Russell and Blackburn [1] define invasive alien species (IAS) as those that have negative impacts. This definition is said to reflect the scientific orthodoxy (consensus) that IAS have negative biodiversity, social, and economic impacts. The authors' restricted definition of IAS is apparently derived from an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) document [2] published in 2000 Guidelines for the Prevention of Biodiversity Loss Caused by Alien Invasive Species.
