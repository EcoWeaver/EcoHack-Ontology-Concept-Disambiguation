First records of polychaetes new to Egyptian Mediterranean waters
Nineteen benthic polychaete species were recorded for the first time in the intertidal zone of the Alexandria coast, south-eastern Mediterranean Sea. They belong to Syllidae (7 species), Hesionidae (3 species), Serpulidae (2 species) and 7 other families (one species each). Of these species Eunice miurai Carrera-Parra & Salazar-Vallejo 1998 appears to be new to the Mediterranean Sea, while four of the alien species earlier recorded in the Mediterranean were found for the first time in Egyptian waters: Opisthosyllis brunnea Langerhans 1879, Loimia medusa Savigny 1822, Syllis schulzi Hartmann-Schroder 1960, Phyllodoce longifrons Ben-Eliahu 1972.
