Patterns of invasion of an urban remnant of a species-rich grassland in southeastern Australia by non-native plant species
The invasion by non-native plant species of an urban remnant of a species-rich Themeda triandra grassland in southeastern Australia was quantified and related to abiotic influences. Richness and cover of non-native species were highest at the edges of the remnant and declined to relatively uniform levels within the remnant. Native species richness and cover were lowest at the edge adjoining a roadside but then showed little relation to distance from edge. Roadside edge quadrats were floristically distinct from most other quadrats when ordinated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis.
