Seed deposition of Eragrostis curvula, an invasive alien plant on a river floodplain
To test the hypothesis that nonbuoyant seeds transported by river water are deposited with mineral sediment particles that have a similar fall velocity through water, we examined the relationship between the size of sediment deposited by a flood and the density of the deposited seeds of a invasive alien plant, Eragrostis curvula. The average estimated fall velocity of the seeds was 2.93 cm/s, and this value was similar to the fall velocity through water of fine sand (about 0.18 mm in size). Most seeds deposited by a flood pulse caused by a typhoon were observed in sites where fine sand and silt had accumulated on the surface. Over the course of two study years, the number of the seeds found in sediment deposited at microsites correlated significantly with the proportion of sediment particles
