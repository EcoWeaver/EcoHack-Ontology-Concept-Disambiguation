Palaeobiology and evolution of the late Cenozoic freshwater molluscs of the Turkana Basin: Unionidae Rafinesque, 1820,partim Coelatura(Bivalvia: Unionoidea)
The Plio-Pleistocene freshwater molluscs of the Omo-Turkana Basin were long considered to be a prima facie example of punctuated equilibrium evolution. However, the absence of a study on their taxonomy has significantly hampered the debate on assumed evolutionary patterns. This paper addresses the systematics and palaeobiology of the bivalve genus Coelatura Conrad, 1853 in the basin. It reveals that a Coelatura species was assigned to the extinct genus Pseudobovaria Adam, 1957 in earlier studies, while another species formerly assigned to Coelatura is not discussed here because it belongs to the extinct Pseudodiplon Adam, 1957. Six Coelatura species are recognized in the Plio-Pleistocene Omo-Turkana Basin, two of which are new to science: C. rhomboidalis sp. nov. and C. magna sp. nov. These two species are considered lacustrine adapted species, both with a strongly dorsally protruded umbo. This adaptation apparently evolved twice independently in the basin within a ~1 Ma period, but it is not observed in any other fossil or extant Coelatura species. Three of the other Coelatura forms can be identified as belonging to the extant C. aegyptiaca, C. bakeri and C. alluaudi. Disentangling the genealogical relationships of these extant species with neontological techniques will provide a test of the palaeontological systematics here proposed. General evaluation of the Turkana Basin coelaturids, and particularly their apparent absence from the first so-called punctuative Suregei Isolate period, corroborates the hypothesis of biological invasions in the basin, but indicates that in situ evolutionary events occurred occasionally.
