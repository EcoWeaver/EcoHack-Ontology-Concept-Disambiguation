Effects of nonindigenous species on diversity and community functioning in the eastern Gulf of Finland (Baltic Sea)
An increase of xenodiversity in plankton and benthos in the eastern Gulf of Finland was observed from 1998 to 2004. Nonindigenous species account for 4.8% of all species found and up to 96% of total biomass. Invasive benthic omnivores, the alien amphipods Gmelinoides fasciatus and Pontogammarus robustoides and the predaceous fish Perccottus glenii with their versatile diets strongly affect the community structure. Invasive sessile seston-feeders that directly (through grazing and water clearance) and indirectly (through recycling of nutrients) interact with other ecosystem components, are mainly represented by the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, which affect the structure of benthic and planktonic communities as well as benthic-pelagic coupling. The invasive predatory cladocerans Cercopagis pengoi and Evadne anonyx and larvae of D. polymorpha are only temporary components in the zooplankton, which is limiting their overall effect. Alien benthic bioturbators, the polychaetes Marenzelleria neglecta and the oligochaete Tubificoides pseudogaster account for a high proportion of total abundance and biomass but their effects on native species need further research.
