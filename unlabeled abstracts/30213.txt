Incipient invasion of Galenia secunda Sond. (Aizoaceae) in Southern Spain
The occurrence of the carpet weed Galenia secunda (L. fil.) Sond. (Aizoaceae) has been reported in Southern Spain. G. secunda is a prostrate perennial species native to South Africa. In this paper, the current distribution of G. secunda and the main habitats invaded in Southern Spain, are reported. The distribution survey revealed an area of occupancy of 92ha and an extent of occurrence of 14,250ha for this species, thus suggesting an early stage of invasion. Since the first citation of this species in Spain (1965), our current data (2007) support a rapid spread and invasiveness of G. secunda as a result of an intense rate of coastal development. G. secunda was more often found near roads, because roads facilitate seed dispersal. G. secunda also appeared in other coastal natural habitats such as sand dunes, where G. secunda forms dense monospecific mats. Studies on its invasion potential and impacts in natural habitats are recommended and control measures should be developed to prevent future expansion.
