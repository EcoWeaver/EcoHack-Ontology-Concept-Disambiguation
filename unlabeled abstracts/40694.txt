Unraveling the historical prevalence of the invasive chytrid fungus in the Bolivian Andes: implications in recent amphibian declines
We studied the historical prevalence of the invasive and pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) among amphibians from the Bolivian Andes. Our aim was also to determine its geographic pattern of dispersion, and a potential host taxonomic signature. We collected frog tissue samples from nine museum collections covering a period from 1863 to 2005 and from the field during 2009-2016. Bd was diagnosed via quantitative PCR in 599 individuals of 17 genera and 54 species. We found an overall Bd prevalence of 41% among 44 species tested. The first incidence of Bd was from a Telmatobius culeus in 1863; this is the earliest report of detection for this pathogen in the world. Results reveal a non-random historical and geographical pattern of Bd occurrence and amphibian declines that suggests the presence of two different invasive strains, an ancient endemic and a more recent introduction. Prevalence of Bd increased significantly by the mid-1990s, particularly in the cloud-forests, and this is coincident with the timing of drastic amphibian declines. In contrast, amphibians occurring in drier altiplano habitats have persisted in spite of Bd presence. We hypothesize that the early 1990s, and the cloud-forests in central Bolivia were the center of an epidemic surge of Bd that took its toll on many species, especially in the genus Telmatobius. Further sampling of cloud-forest species, and ongoing genetic studies of Bd isolates from Bolivia should help resolve the history of this invasive pathogen and test hypotheses on the differential response of endangered hosts.
