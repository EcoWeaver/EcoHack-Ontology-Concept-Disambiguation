Mayan diver-fishers as citizen scientists: detection and monitoring of the invasive red lionfish in the Parque Nacional Arrecife Alacranes, southern Gulf of Mexico
Biological invasions research has increasingly incorporated the participation of citizen scientists to collect data for monitoring and management purposes. This study outlines collaborative efforts with Mayan lobster diver-fishers, who participated voluntarily as citizen scientists in surveys, to detect and monitor the invasive red lionfish, Pterois volitans, in a marine protected area off the northern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We engaged these fishers by building local capacity and awareness of the threats of the lionfish invasion on the fishery resources of the area. During the lobster fishing season (July 2010-February 2011), 30 fishers collected 248 red lionfish (9-29 cm TL) and recorded ancillary data (day, month, depth, and approximate coordinates of capture site). This collaboration not only allowed the first lionfish detection in the Parque Nacional Arrecife Alacranes in 2010, but the volunteer-based monitoring effort revealed that the invasion reached levels from intermediate to advanced, with more than 200 specimens captured in less than a year. Our results support the notion that engaging citizen scientists can enhance research, reduce costs, and improve the possibility of a long term monitoring survey.
