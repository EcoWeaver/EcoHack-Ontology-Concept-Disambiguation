VERTICAL STRUCTURE OF THE ARBOREAL COMPONENT UNDER REGENERATION PHASE OF A DECIDUOUS FOREST FRAGMENT, SANTA CATARINA STATE, BRAZIL
ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to evaluate the structure (horizontal and vertical) of a Deciduous Forest, located between the municipalities of Piratuba and Ipira (SC). 14.000 m2 of tree communities were analyzed, sub- divided into 14 plots of 10 x 100 m, where all individuals with DBH equal to or greater than 4.0 cm were sampled and identified. For natural regeneration were sampled 560 m2, divided into 14 plots of 10 x 4 m. In the tree strata were sampled 2.125 individuals belonging to 34 families, 80 genera and 113 species with a total density of 1.517 ind.ha-1. Natural regeneration were sampled 196 individuals belonging to 24 families and 49 species with a total density of 3.500 ind. ha-1. Luehea divaricata Mart., Actinostemon concolor (Spreng) Mull. Arg. and Parapiptadenia rigida (Benth.) Brenan had of value of increased importance (7,1%, 7,0 % and 5,3%, respectively). Actinostemon concolor got high value Relative Natural Regeneration (18,1%). The low percentage of natural regeneration of species as Luehea divaricata and Parapiptadenia rigida, respectively 3,7% and 1,5%, typical of EDF , may represent a maintenance commitment in the community. The study revealed the presence of exotic species with invasive potential, as Hovenia dulcis Thumb. These facts point to the importance of the adoption of management measures, since the forest fragment studied is advancing successional terms, however, anthropogenic interference with signals in the floristic composition. These facts point to the importance of the adoption of management measures, since the forest fragment studied is suffering anthropogenic impact, influencing the ecological succession mechanisms.
