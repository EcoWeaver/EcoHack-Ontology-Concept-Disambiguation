ALIEN FLORA OF THE CITY OF MOSTAR (BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA)
In this paper, an attempt is made for the first time to present a complete list of the vascular flora of the urban area of Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. A total of 965 plant taxa were collected during different seasons of the year and from various biotopes within the city. The most common families are Asteraceae s.l. (11.09%), Poaceae (10.67%) and Fabaceae (7.25%), while therophytes (38.86%) are the most abundant life form. The analysis of the urban flora of the city of Mostar showed that Mediterranean plants predominate (27.00%). Native species accounted for 84.35 % of the total number of taxa. The significant proportion of Mediterranean plants and the relatively high proportion therophytes indicate that the flora of Mostar has developed under the influence of the Mediterranean climate and a significant anthropogenic influence. The percentage contribution of endemics (2.80%) is also important.
