Changes to the Spatial Distribution of Ageratum conyzoides (Asterales: Asteraceae) Due to Red Imported Fire Ants Solenopsis invicta (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in China
Solenopsis invicta is an aggressive, destructive and invasive ant. It has a profound impact on the native species in its environment. In this paper, we studied the effect of S. invicta on the invasive weed Ageratum conyzoides in the field. Using grid sampling and geostatistical analysis, we found that the density of A. conyzoides increased significantly in the presence of S. invicta. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of A. conyzoides was affected by S. invicta. The spatial structure of A. conyzoides emergence was aggregated. Sites where S. invicta was present were described by a Gaussian model, whereas a spatial model was used to describe the sites in the absence of S. invicta. The range of spatial dependence was 7.07m for sites with a high density of S. invicta, whereas the spatial dependence was 1.46m for sites with a low density of S. invicta and 3.14m for control sites. Semivariogram models based on grid sampling of actual emerging A. conyzoides densities were used to produce contour maps of A. conyzoides densities in the field.
