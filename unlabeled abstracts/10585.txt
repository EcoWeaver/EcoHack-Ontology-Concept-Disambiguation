Population genetic structure and migration patterns ofLiriomyza sativaein China: moderate subdivision and no Bridgehead effect revealed by microsatellites
AbstractWhileLiriomyza sativae(Diptera: Agromyzidae), an important invasive pest of ornamentals and vegetables has been found in China for the past two decades, few studies have focused on its genetics or route of invasive. In this study, we collected 288L. sativaeindividuals across 12 provinces to explore its population genetic structure and migration patterns in China using seven microsatellites. We found relatively low levels of genetic diversity but moderate population genetic structure (0.05 <FST< 0.15) inL. sativaefrom China. All populations deviated significantly from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to heterozygote deficiency. Molecular variance analysis revealed that more than 89% of variation was among samples within populations. A UPGMA dendrogram revealed that SH and GXNN populations formed one cluster separate from the other populations, which is in accordance with STRUCTURE and GENELAND analyses. A Mantel test indicated that genetic distance was not correlated to geographic distance (r= -0.0814,P= 0.7610), coupled with high levels of gene flow (M= 40.1-817.7), suggesting a possible anthropogenic influence on the spread ofL. sativaein China and on the effect of hosts. The trend of asymmetrical gene flow was from southern to northern populations in general and did not exhibit a Bridgehead effect during the course of invasion, as can be seen by the low genetic diversity of southern populations.
