Bark-stripping damage by Callosciurus finlaysonii introduced into Italy
The Finlayson's squirrel Callosciurus finlaysonii was introduced into Italy during the 1980s and has established two viable populations. The diet of this species includes a high proportion of tree barks, suggesting an intensive debarking behavior. We reported a severe bark-stripping impact in both colonized areas, and we tested whether a preference for some tree species existed. Results of this work showed the presence of a wide spectrum of damaged species, without any strong preference, mainly with large wounds. Old deciduous plants and conifers, which presented a hard bark, were usually avoided.
