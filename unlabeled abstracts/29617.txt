A review of the life history, invasion process, and potential management of Clavelina lepadiformis Muller, 1776: a recent invasion of the northwest Atlantic
The colonial tunicate Clavelina lepadiformis is a recent invader to the northwest Atlantic and has the potential to cause ecological and economic harm. This paper provides a review of the biological and ecological characteristics of C. lepadiformis, and hypothesizes the likely mechanisms of introduction, establishment and future expansion. The intent of this paper is to provide a consolidated source of information for marine ecosystem managers and provide a starting point for developing a management strategy, should one be desired. Although C. lepadiformis is not currently a management challenge because of the limited range of the invasion in North America; the similarities between C. lepadiformis and other tunicate invaders, and the proximity of incipient populations to boating, shipping, aquaculture, and energy infrastructure suggest future economic burden of this new invader. Other regions such as the west coast of North America and New Zealand may be at risk for invasion by C. lepadiformis.
