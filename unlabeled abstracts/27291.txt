Opposite relationships between invasibility and native species richness at patch versus landscape scales
of native species. In 1 m2 patches, native cover was positively associated with native richness and thus cover-related competition was a likely mechanism by which richness influenced R. cathartica . At the landscape scale (comparing the aggregate stand-scale metrics among the 17 stands), native cover and richness were still positively related, but had opposite relationships with R. cathartica cover. R. cathartica cover was positively related to species richness and negatively related to native species cover. The observed switch at different scales from a positive to a negative relationship between R. cathartica cover and native richness supported the hypothesized scale dependence of these relations. Propagule pressure, which we estimated by measuring the size of nearby mature R. cathartica shrubs, had a large positive effect on R. cathartica seedling cover at the landscape scale. These results suggest that landscape patterns of invasion may be best understood in light of the combination of many factors including native diversity, native cover, and propagule pressure.
