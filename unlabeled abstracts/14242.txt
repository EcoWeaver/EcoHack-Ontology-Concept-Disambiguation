Collaborative Learning about Forest Understory Restoration and Management: Identifying Goals and Sharing Knowledge
Ecosystem services provided by forests (e.g., nutrient cycling) are critical in midwestern landscapes. We conducted collaborative workshops with forest landowners and management professionals using specific strategies to provide information about nutrient dynamics in forests and learn about goals/obstacles for forest management in Iowa. Preparticipation surveys assessed knowledge and goals and postparticipation surveys measured learning and potential for forest management. Landowners' goals included conservation, aesthetics, recreation, and water quality, whereas lack of management activities (e.g., harvesting), insufficient funding, and invasive species were cited as obstacles. Education and restoration of ecosystem integrity were identified as means to achieve goals. The collaborative learning framework contributed to increased participant knowledge about ecosystem structure/function and plans for invasive species control, timber stand improvement, and restoration of desirable species. Facilitators learned that resources on invasive species management, as well as "easy-to-use" information about understory plants, would support additional restoration education and action.
