The invasive land flatworm Obama nungara (Platyhelminthes: Geoplanidae) reaches a natural environment in the oceanic island of Sao Miguel (Acores)
During an entomological sampling trip in the island of Sao Miguel (Acores, Portugal) on 02-11-2019 by Jose Rafael Gonzalez-Lopez, one specimen of the invasive flatworm Obama nungara Carbayo et al. 2016 was found under a rock (Fig. 1A). The specimen was photographed in situ and identified by its external morphology based on its large and broad leaf-like body with nearly parallel body margins, narrow and rounded anterior end, rounded posterior end, and dorsal pigmentation consisting of a light brown ground color covered with dark longitudinal and irregular stripes, and ventral surface grayish-white. Recent studies (Justine et al. 2020; Negrete et al. 2020) showed the reliability of photograph-based identification of O. nungara specimens. It is the sixth island where this species has been found (after Guernsey, Great Britain, Ireland, Corsica, and Madeira).
