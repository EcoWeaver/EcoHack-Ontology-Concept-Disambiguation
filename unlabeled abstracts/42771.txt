Small but Mighty: The Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) as a Model Species of Biological Invasions
Invasive "game-changer" species cause severe ecological impacts such as "phase shifts" in recipient ecosystems all over the world. Since the early 1990s, the ongoing global spread of the small but highly invasive Ponto-Caspian round goby Neogobius melanostomus into diverse freshwater and marine ecosystems has been observed. We postulate that this species is an ideal model to better understand and mitigate aquatic invasions. Its wide invaded range, as well as its diverse impacts on native species, have triggered a large body of research worldwide concerning its spread, ecology, and traits facilitating invasion. Several hypotheses related to invasiveness have been tested for the round goby, which are also applicable to other invasive species and for understanding general principles in invasion biology. However, a common theory explaining invasion success, especially in round goby, is still lacking. Many case studies do not consider time since invasion and use different sampling protocols and methodologies, hampering the comparability of results and conclusions. We thus propose strengthening the network of goby researchers and establishing long-term databases based on continuous and harmonized monitoring covering all stages of the invasion process as crucial requirements to better understand and manage aquatic invasions. In many cases, such monitoring can easily be integrated into existing survey schemes.
