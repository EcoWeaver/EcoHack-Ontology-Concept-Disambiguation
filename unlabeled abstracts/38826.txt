Distribution of Two Strains of Leptoglossus zonatus (Dallas) (Hemiptera: Coreidae) in the Western Hemisphere: Is L. zonatus a Potential Invasive Species in California?
The leaffooted plant bug, Leptoglossus zonatus (Dallas) (Hemiptera: Coreidae) is polyphagous and widely distributed in the Western Hemisphere. Although it has been recorded in California since around 1900, it has become a more common pest in almonds in the last decade. Other studies have shown that an established insect can become a pest when a new genotype is introduced. This study investigated the distribution of two lineages (strains) of L. zonatus in the Western Hemisphere. Specimens from the Leptoglossus collection in the national insect collection in Mexico were used to extract DNA and sequence the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I (mtDNA COI) gene, for use in population genetic and phylogenetic analyses. New sequences from Mexico, Central and South America were combined with those available in GenBank, from California and Brazil. Two lineages (strains) of L. zonatus were uncovered. One lineage occurs in California, Mexico and Ecuador. The second lineage is more widespread and found in California, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Brazil. The haplotype number and diversity, and nucleotide diversity, were found for samples from California, Mexico, and Brazil, for the two lineages, and for all 118 sequences combined. All sequences combined produced five haplotypes, and a haplotype diversity of 0.54. California and Brazil had 3 haplotypes each, with one haplotype shared (5 total). Haplotype diversity in California and in Brazil were 0.526 and 0.505, respectively. A haplotype network found that one haplotype was most abundant and widespread. The small number of haplotypes, a range expansion, and economic pest status of L. zonatus in California, all contribute to this insect being a potentially invasive insect pest.
