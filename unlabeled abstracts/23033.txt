Non-native fish species in Slovak waters: origins and present status
Freshwater fishes recorded in the territory of Slovakia include 95 fish species. As many as one third of these are allochthonous fish species belonging to 14 families, among which several have not occurred in Slovakia recently. Historically, there were three main periods of introduction: the first is the beginning of the 20th century, the second includes two decades between 1955 and 1975 and the third period is from the year 1990 up to the present time. The origins of the exotic species seen in Slovakia are the four continents -- Africa (3), North America (7), Central America (3), and Asia (13) and ten of them are from different regions in Europe. The purpose of intentional introductions of non-native species was to occupy vacant ecological niches in the ecosystems reshaped by human activities, fish stocking, angling or fish farming. Some of these species spread from their original ranges or they penetrated spontaneously from the adjacent countries via the river network system. At the present time, 76 fish species in total form populations in Slovakia. There are 54 autochthonous and 22 allochthonous species, 14 of them are exotic fishes. The invasive characters in 13 fish species were considered, the recent native/total fish ratio is 0.71. Key wordsintroduced fishes-Danube-Tisa-Dunajec-biological invasion
