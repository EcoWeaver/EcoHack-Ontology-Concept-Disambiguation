Tree seedling and sapling density and deer browsing incidence on recently logged and mature non-industrial private forestlands in Virginia, USA
We compared the density and species composition of seedlings and saplings as well as the evidence of browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on recently logged and mature non-industrial private forestland (NIPF) stands in south-central Virginia. Nine stands had been harvested within the past 2 years and the nine mature forest stands had not been harvested within the past 30-40 years. Seedling (trees <0.5 m tall) density was similar on recently logged and mature stands. Sapling (>=0.5 m tall, but <10 cm diameter at breast height) density was more than two times greater on recently logged stands than mature stands, although this difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant correlation between stand basal area and seedling or sapling density. Some evidence of browsing by deer was observed for almost all tree species recorded. For logged sites, 0.9% of all seedlings had evidence of browsing compared to 3.4% of seedlings in mature stands. There was significantly more evidence of browsing on saplings in mature forest stands (22.9%) compared to recently logged stands (6.1%) and browsing evidence significantly increased with increasing basal area. Evidence of high browsing pressure and low sapling density on mature forest stands may indicate a problem with advance regeneration on NIPF stands in this part of Virginia. Logged stands had a significantly higher abundance of seedlings and saplings of yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), the most valuable timber species in the study area and one that did not show much evidence of browsing by deer. Logging, however, appeared to promote the colonization of the nonnative invasive species ailanthus (Ailanthus altissima).
