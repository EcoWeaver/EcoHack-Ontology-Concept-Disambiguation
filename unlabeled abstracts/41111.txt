Efficiency of coupled invasive weed optimization-adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system method to assess physical habitats in streams
AbstractThis study presents a coupled invasive weed optimization-adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system method to simulate physical habitat in streams. We implement proposed method in Lar national park in Iran as one of the habitats of Brown trout in southern Caspian Sea basin. Five indices consisting of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), reliability index, vulnerability index and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) are utilized to compare observed fish habitats and simulated fish habitats. Based on results, measurement indices demonstrate model is robust to assess physical habitats in rivers. RMSE and MAE are 0.09 and 0.08 respectively. Besides, NSE is 0.78 that indicates robustness of model. Moreover, it is necessary to apply developed habitat model in a practical habitat simulation. We utilize two-dimensional hydraulic model in steady state to simulate depth and velocity distribution. Based on qualitative comparison between results of model and observation, coupled invasive weed optimization-adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system method is robust and reliable to simulate physical habitats. We recommend utilizing proposed model for physical habitat simulation in streams for future studies.
