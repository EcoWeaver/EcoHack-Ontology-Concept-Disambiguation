The distribution, establishment and life-history traits of non-native sailfin catfishes Pterygoplichthys spp. in the Guangdong Province of China
In China, the introduction of South American sailfin catfishes of the genus Pterygoplichthys are a concern due to the potential risks they pose to native environments. The present study reports on the distribution, establishment and maturity of a Pterygoplichthys spp. hybrid swarm in Guangdong Province, China. Distribution data demonstrate that Pterygoplichthys spp. are widespread in Guangdong Province, whereas only a few records were found in other parts of the country. The presence of mature Pterygoplichthys spp. females indicated established self-sustaining populations in most drainages in the study region. While variation in size at maturity and condition was observed among populations established in different drainages, Pterygoplichthys spp. in Guangdong Province appear to mature at a smaller size than in other non-native ranges. National-level legislation with which to prevent and/or mitigate the release of other non-native fishes into the wild is recommended.
