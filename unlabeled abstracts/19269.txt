New Distributional Records of Invasive Coleoptera Found in Connecticut and Other Eastern States: Agrilus cyanescens (Ratzeburg) (Buprestidae), Lilioceris lilii (Scopoli), and Pyrrhalta Viburni (Paykull) (Chrysomelidae)
Three invasive species of Coleoptera--the honeysuckle borer, Agrilus cyanescens (Ratzeburg); the lily leaf beetle, Lilioceris lilii (Scopoli); and the viburnum leaf beetle, Pyrrhalta viburni (Paykull)--have become increasingly common in Connecticut and other northeastern states during the past decade. To determine their current distribution in Connecticut, I sampled in all eight counties mainly between 2006 and 2010. The European buprestid, A. cyanescens, was found at 44 new sites scattered throughout each county of Connecticut. Based upon museum specimens not previously examined, A. cyanescens has been in Connecticut since at least 1957. Two adults were reared from an unidentified Lonicera sp., which apparently is the first host to be documented in North America. The Eurasian chrysomelid, Lilioceris lilii, occurred in all of the counties of Connecticut, being collected at 64 new sites. In addition to infesting Asiatic lilies, Lilium spp., in gardens, adults of this beetle also ate the foliage of two native lilies, Lilium canadense L. and Lilium superbum L. The Eurasian chrysomelid, P. viburni, infested wild Viburnum dentatum L. or V. opulus L. var. americanum Aiton at 49 sites in 7 of 8 Connecticut counties, a substantial range increase since its first detection in 2004. Based upon the observed distributional pattern, the viburnum leaf beetle recently entered the state from the north or northwest and spread south or southeast.
