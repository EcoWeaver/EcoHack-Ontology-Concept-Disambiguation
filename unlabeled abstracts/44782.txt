Introduction and invasion of common myna (Acridotheres tristis) in Kruger National Park, South Africa: still time for action?
Common myna (Acridotheres tristis) is a passerine bird native to south-east Asia, established as an alien in many parts of the world including South Africa, where it is invasive. Common mynas are synanthropic birds with a strong preference for urban areas that usually do not expand into natural areas. However, as we document here, since the first records in Kruger National Park in 2000 when the birds started to spread from outside the park, the rate of spread has recently dramatically increased, with last three years accounting for 66% of the total number of 128 sightings. Thirty-two birds were observed to be nesting or breeding. This data suggests that the common myna in Kruger National Park is in the initial phase of establishment. Although the impacts on native birds at a population level are unlikely to be severe in a large natural savanna area with little human influence, the species is scored as having moderate impact in the EICAT IUCN scheme. Thus, we suggest that the population of common myna needs to be monitored and controlled to prevent it from further increase and spread.
