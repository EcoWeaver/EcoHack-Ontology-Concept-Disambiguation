Removal of larvae of two marine invasive bivalves, Mytilopsis sallei (Recluz, 1849) and Mytella strigata (Hanley, 1843), by water treatment processes
The uptake and discharge of bivalve larvae through ballast water operations is a highly viable mechanism for transfer of shellfish. In this paper, we investigate the effects of common water treatment processes on the planktotrophic larvae of the two invasive species of shellfish, Mytilopsis sallei and Mytella strigata. The study found that common water treatment processes used in many ballast water treatment systems were effective for the removal of bivalve larvae, although later stages of larval forms required more effort to remove.
