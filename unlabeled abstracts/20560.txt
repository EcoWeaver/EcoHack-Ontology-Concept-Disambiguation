Biological invasion impact assessment system: From idea to implementation
We describe the Biological Invasion Impact / Biopollution Assessment System (BINPAS), an online application for assessment of invasive species impacts. The methodology is based on a classification of the abundance and distribution range of alien species related to the magnitude of their impacts on communities, habitats and ecosystem functioning. Then formalized data is aggregated in a hybrid ranking and the system provides a "Biopollution Level" (BPL), ranging from "no measurable impact" (BPL=0) to "massive impact" (BPL=4). BINPAS was created using open source web technologies and relational database management systems. The system provides a user-friendly interface to calculate BPL, it allows for the sharing of ecological data, providing inter-regional comparisons and meta-analysis of biological invasion effects at different spatial and temporal scales.
