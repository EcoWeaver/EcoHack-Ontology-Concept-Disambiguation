Controlling a plant invader by targeted disruption of its life cycle
1. Pest management strategies should be informed by research on a broad suite of biotic and abiotic interactions. We used a life table response experiment (LTRE) to assess the reliability of ragwort Jacobaea vulgaris management recommendations based on interactions of (i) time of disturbance to initiate experimental units, (ii) herbivory from two biological control organisms, the cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaeae and ragwort flea beetle Longitarsus jacobaeae and (iii) interspecific competition by perennial grasses.
