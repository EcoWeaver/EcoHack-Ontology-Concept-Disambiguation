Successful establishment of the invasive fire antSolenopsis invictain Taiwan: insights into interactions of alternate social forms
Aim Understanding the factors underlying the successful establishment of invasive ant species is critical for developing quarantine strategies to prevent additional invasions as well as for determining how such species overcome the selective pressures in invaded areas. Although several studies have revealed differences in the social organization and population genetics of invasive ants in their native and introduced ranges, few studies have considered the potential interactions between alternate social forms within newly-invaded areas simply because many invasive ants are characterized as polygyne or unicolonial.
