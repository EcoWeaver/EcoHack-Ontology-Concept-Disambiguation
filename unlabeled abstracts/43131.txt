Tourism is not only the vector of biological invasion but also the victim: Evidence from Israel
In his paper on 'Tourism and biological exchange and invasions: a missing dimension in sustainable tourism?' which was published in Tourism Recreation Research 40(1), 2015, 81-94, Michael Hall argues that an increase in the movement of alien species is directly related to the growth of international tourism. Using the case of Israel, we shall attempt to show that tourism is a victim of biological invasion rather than its vector. The choice of Israel is purposive because it is situated on the crossroads of three continents (Asia, Africa and Europe) and has been the epicenter of human mobility for thousands of years, and thus it became a habitat of many alien species (Frankenberg, 1999). The worst cases of biological invasion in Israel concerning species that were introduced via land/ocean use changes were intentionally introduced for ecological purposes (e.g. dune stabilization) or accidentally introduced via infested shipments.
