Rapid digestion of fish prey by the highly invasive 'detritivore'Oreochromis mossambicus
Stomach residence time was tested over 24 h in three size classes of Oreochromis mossambicus using juvenile Lates calcarifer. In all 63 observations, the fish prey was digested within 24 h of consumption and most probably within 1 h, suggesting a need to re-evaluate the trophic status and potential effects of this highly invasive species.
