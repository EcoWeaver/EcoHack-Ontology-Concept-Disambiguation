The long-term dynamics and current distribution of macrozoobenthos communities in the Eastern Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea
The distribution of macrozoobenthos communities in the eastern Gulf of Finland from 2001 to 2012 was examined based on long-term data. The most significant changes in the benthos up to 2008 were connected with recurring hypoxic events and with the large-scale expansion of the non-indigenous polychaete Marenzelleria arctia since 2009.
