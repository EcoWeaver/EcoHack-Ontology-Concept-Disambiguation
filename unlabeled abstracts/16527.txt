Atypical uterine cervix metastases from invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast
Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) of the breast is the second most common histologic subtype of breast cancer, representing 10% of breast cancer occurrences. It differs from invasive ductal carcinoma in its epidemiology, clinical and radiological presentation, associated molecular changes, and the natural course of disease. Often, ILC presents at an advanced stage of onset in postmenopausal women [1]. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
