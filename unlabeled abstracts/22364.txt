Prey-induced changes to a predator's behaviour and morphology: Implications for shell-claw covariance in the northwest Atlantic
Whereas many plasticity studies demonstrate the importance of inducible defences among prey, far fewer investigate the potential role of inducible offences among predators. Here we ask if natural differences in a snail's shell hardness can induce developmental changes to a predatory crab's claw size. To do this, we fed Littorina obtusata snails from either thick- or thin-shelled populations to captive European green crabs Carcinus maenas. The crabs' shell-breaking behaviour dominated among those fed thin-shelled snails, whereas crabs fed thick-shelled snails mostly winkled flesh through the shell opening without damaging the shell itself (a.k.a. aperture-probing behaviour). Significantly, the size of crab crusher claws grew in proportion to the frequency of shell-crushing behaviour and, for a same shell-crushing frequency, crabs fed thick-shelled snails grew larger crusher claws than those fed thin-shelled snails after two experimental moults. Diet and behaviour had no effect on the growth of the smaller cutter claws of same individuals, providing good evidence that allometric changes to crusher claws were indeed a result of differential use while feeding. Findings indicate that both predation habits and claw sizes are affected by green crabs' diet, supporting the hypothesis that prey-induced phenotypic plasticity contributes to earlier accounts of shell-claw covariance between this predator and its Littorina prey in the wild.
