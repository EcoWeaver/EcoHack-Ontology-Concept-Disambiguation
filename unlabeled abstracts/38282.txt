Social media reveals the first records of the invasive lionfish Pterois miles (Bennett, 1828) and parrotfish Scarus ghobban Forsskal, 1775 from Egypt (Mediterranean Sea)
The common lionfish Pterois miles and the blue-barred parrotfish Scarus ghobban are Indo-Pacific marine fishes that have invaded several regions in the Mediterranean Sea. Two P. miles individuals and a single S. ghobban were caught off the coast of Egypt in 2018. These are first reports on the occurrences of both species in Egyptian waters, resulting in an update of their distribution in the Mediterranean Sea.
