Invasive plant mats promoted the decomposition of native leaf litter by micro-, meio-, and macroinvertebrates in an eutrophic freshwater lake in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China
To investigate the effect of invasive Alternanthera philoxeroides mats on native leaf litter decomposition, we allocated two native leaf species of contrasting recalcitrance (Neosinocalamus affinis and Ficus virens) in litterbags with four different mesh sizes (0.025, 0.042, 0.5, and 5 mm) and the bags were either incubated under floating A. philoxeroides mats (Vegetated site) or under floating plastic foam boards without A. philoxeroides mats (Unvegetated site) for 65 days in Jianhu Lake, China, in July 2020. The average decomposition rates increased with pore size of litterbags. The interaction intensity of the site effect in leaf mass loss was negative in 0.025 mesh and positive in other meshes, while no significance existed between two native species in the same mesh sizes and sites. The contribution of microbes to decomposition was more than 50% in both sites. The contribution in the vegetation site was as follows: microbes > microinvertebrates > meioinvertebrates > macroinvertebrates, compared with microbes > macroinvertebrates > meioinvertebrates > microinvertebrates in the unvegetated site. The results suggest that A. philoxeroides mats can promote the decomposition of native leaf litter, and that the roles of micro-, meio-, and macroinvertebrates in decomposition are important but underestimated.
