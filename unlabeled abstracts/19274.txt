Variability in growth of Deladenus siricidicola on strains of the white rot fungus Amylostereum areolatum
Deladenus siricidicola nematodes are used extensively for biological control of Sirex noctilio in the southern hemisphere. They have one morph that is parasitic on S. noctilio and another that feeds on the white rot fungus Amylostereum areolatum and is used for mass production of the nematode. To examine potential effects of strains of A. areolatum found in North America on D. siricidicola in a biological control program, first we compared the growth of four isolates of A. areolatum on several types of artificial media. We then evaluated the ability of D. siricidicola to survive and increase on five isolates of A. areolatum and found that nematode populations persisted on all five isolates. One of the slowest growing fungal isolates, ScyME, produced the most nematodes when the fungus was given five and ten days of growth prior to nematode inoculation, while the fastest growing fungus, Aussie, never produced the most nematodes. Although nematodes in all treatments produced eggs, D. siricidicola populations were unable to replace themselves when feeding on the fungal isolate SedDF. The differential ability of D. siricidicola to persist on different isolates of A. areolatum found in North America could affect multiple aspects of a biological control program to control S. noctilio.
