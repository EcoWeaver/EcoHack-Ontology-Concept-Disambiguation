Determinants of the geographical extent of invasive plants in China: effects of biogeographical origin, life cycle and time since introduction
Plant invasions cause serious impacts to environment and human economy, and lots of researches have been paid to examine factors that determine the geographical extent of plant invaders. Many intrinsic species attributes, external environmental factors, and time since introduction have all been proposed to explain invasive success. Data on invasive plants distribution in province regions in China were collected, and species attributes and historical factors such as biogeographical origin, life cycle, and time since introduction were determined. While some annuals may eventually occupy the whole country area, perennials are unlikely to do so, particularly those from Central and South America. Time since introduction is significantly related to the number of provinces occupied by an invader; nevertheless after control of certain residence time, annuals are not likely to more provinces than the perennial herbs. High-impact invaders tend to spread faster than other invaders, but only when their life cycle is taken into account. This suggests that other plant traits, instead of life cycle, along with extrinsic factors, greatly contribute to invasive success and distribution area. Invasive plants in China are mainly distributed in human-made habitats, and their long-distance dispersal is primarily associated with human activities. Future studies need to consider interactions between species traits, environmental conditions, and human activities for further insights in researches alike.
