Community impacts of two invasive crabs: the interactive roles of density, prey recruitment, and indirect effects
Assessing the implications of species invasion for native communities requires determining whether effects of invaders are novel, or are redundant with effects of species that are already present. Using a pair of field experiments conducted over two successive years, we examined factors that influence community impacts of a recent predatory crab invader (Hemigrapsus sanguineus) and a previously established invasive crab (Carcinus maenas) on New England coasts. We demonstrate that effects of these species differ temporally with changes in the ambient prey community, and are influenced by density differences between the two species and by different strengths and types of indirect effects that each elicits. Our study highlights the importance of including bottom-up processes (i.e., prey recruitment) when examining the redundancy of consumers.
