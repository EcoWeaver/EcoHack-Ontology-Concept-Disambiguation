Acorns of invasive Northern Red Oak (Quercus rubra) in Europe are larval hosts for moths and beetles
In their first phase of expanding into new areas, invasive plants often take advantage of the inability of existing herbivores and pathogenic species to exploit them. However, in the longer term local enemies may adapt to using these invasive species as a food source. This study assesses the use of mature acorns of two oak species in Europe (the native Pedunculate Oak Quercus robur and the invasive Northern Red Oak Quercus rubra) by moths Cydia fagiglandana and Cydia splendana and beetles Curculio spp. We show that acorns of invasive oak species can be equally attractive to C. splendana but only partially so to C. fagiglandana where infestation rates where significantly lower (approximately half) compared to the native oak. The infestation by Curculio beetles of Northern Red Oak was marginal, less than 1% of the rate in the native oak species. The larval final weights did not differ significantly between host species, but emergence of C. splendana and Curculio spp. took significantly longer in acorns of Northern Red Oak. It is likely that C. fagiglandana and C. splendana have increased their niche breadths by exploiting invasive oak species and avoiding competition with the Curculio weevils. Furthermore, the occurrence of Northern Red Oak could stabilize food resources during years when native oak species have poor acorn crops.
