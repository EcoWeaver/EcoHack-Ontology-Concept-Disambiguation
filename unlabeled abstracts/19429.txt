Are plant populations in expanding ranges made up of escaped cultivars? The case of Ilex aquifolium in Denmark
Rapid range expansions are becoming more prevalent, especially as climate continues to change. The escape of ornamental plants within their native range represents a significant, but often overlooked component of this process. Few studies have focused on the role of ornamental plants in range expansions using molecular markers to identify the possibility of mixed native and cultivar populations. The purpose of the present study was to determine the genetic variation of a native woody plant with ornamental conspecifics at the edge of its distribution. We selected Ilex aquifolium L. (English holly) which grows naturally in Denmark but is spreading eastward in Scandinavia, possibly due to a combination of climate change and introduction of more frost-tolerant cultivars. We sampled 187 individuals from older and recently established populations, and cultivated I. aquifolium throughout Denmark, and compared them using nuclear SSR and AFLP. The overall results showed no structure or clustering of plants from the historical or the expanding range, or of wild or cultivated plants. The only clusters found were for a group of cultivated hybrid I. aquifolium. The samples represented four genetic groupings, indicating either hybridization between cultivated and wild I. aquifolium or replacement of the latter by cultivars. Thus, ornamental genotypes of I. aquifolium contribute to the northeastern range expansion of the species and eventual invasiveness within its native range.
