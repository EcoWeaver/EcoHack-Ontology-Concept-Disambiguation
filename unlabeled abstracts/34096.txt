Sensory Biology as a Risk Factor for Invasion Success and Native Fish Decline
Native freshwater fish populations are among the worlds most threatened taxa resulting from the combined effects of habitat degradation and invasive alien species. Habitat degradation negatively impacts native species, whereas invasive species tend to possess adaptations, such as thermal and saline tolerance, more suited to the degraded environment. Sensory ecology may also be a contributing factor. Most threatened native species are visual feeders whereas invasive species found in degraded systems often have nonvisual specializations. Behavioral and distributional characteristics of invasive mosquitofish Gambusia affinis and New Zealand native inanga Galaxias maculatus illustrate the potential for sensory biology to influence foraging success, distribution, and species interaction between degraded and clear habitats. Behavioral trials measured the change in feeding rate in clear (4 NTU) and turbid (100 NTU) over 30 min for inanga and mosquitofish feeding on Artemia nauplii. These experiments show that between clear and turbid water mosquitofish maintain similar feeding rates, whereas the native species exhibit a marked decline in feeding efficiency. Across a strong natural turbidity boundary the alien species was found to dominate turbid habitat less than a meter from clear water where both species were found. Accounting for the sensory biology of a fish species as a potential contributing factor in the establishment of invasive species in degraded habitat may help identify invasive species risk and shape strategies for rehabilitating native species.
