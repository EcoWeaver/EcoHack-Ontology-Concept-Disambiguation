Identification and characterization of natural viruses associated with the invasive insect pest Drosophila suzukii.
The invasive insect pest Drosophila suzukii infests ripening fruits and causes extensive damage to crops in the northern hemisphere. Novel, environmentally friendly strategies to control the spread of this species are urgently needed, and one promising approach is the deployment of entomopathogenic viruses. Here we report the identification and characterization of two natural viruses associated with D. suzukii: Drosophila A virus (DAV) and La Jolla virus (LJV). Our work provides new tools for the development of biological control agents that protect crops against D. suzukii without a harmful impact on biodiversity.
