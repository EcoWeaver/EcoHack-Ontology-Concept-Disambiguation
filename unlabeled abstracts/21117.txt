Evaluating the effectiveness of SCUBA-based visual searches for an invasive tunicate, Ciona intestinalis, in a Prince Edward Island estuary
Visual searches are a common method of detecting invasive species in coastal waters, but the statistical properties of search methods have rarely been evaluated. Understanding the error rate (especially false negatives) and effective detection distance of searches can improve survey design, and quantify the uncertainty in risk assessments used to inform invasive species management efforts. An experiment using artificial tunicates ("decoys") was conducted in Hillsborough Bay, Prince Edward Island, to determine the effectiveness of SCUBA divers conducting underwater visual searches for the vase tunicate, Ciona intestinalis (Linnaeus, 1767). Single decoys and clusters of three decoys, constructed from water-filled, ivory-coloured balloons 5-6 cm in length, were placed at a blue mussel, Mytilus edulis (Linnaeus, 1758), aquaculture site on buoys, lines and mussel socks. The probability of detecting tunicate decoys on a mussel sock in the experiment is 89.8% (+/- SD 7.1), known in this paper as a true positive. The probability of not detecting tunicate decoys actually placed on a mussel sock in the experiment is 10.2% (+/- SD 7.1), known in this paper as a false negative. Divers detected 79.2% (+/- SD 7.1) of single decoys and 94.0% (+/- 11.4) of clusters. Divers were able to detect single decoys from a measured horizontal distance of 2.7 m (+/- 0.8), and clusters from 2.8 m (+/- 0.9). The typical detection distance for real C. intestinalis estimated by divers was, on average, 2.1 m (range 1 - 3 m), and tunicates of lengths >= 2.9 cm (range 1-4 cm) could be detected.
