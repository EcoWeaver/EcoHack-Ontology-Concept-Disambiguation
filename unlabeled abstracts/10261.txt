Finding Dory: first record of Paracanthurus hepatus (Perciformes: Acanthuridae) in the Mediterranean Sea
A single individual of the palette surgeonfish, Paracanthurus hepatus, is reported for Bat Yam, Israel. This is the first report of this species for the Mediterranean Sea. Since this Indo-Pacific species does not occur in the Red Sea, and is one of the most popular marine aquarium fish, its introduction is referred to as aquarium release. The impact of aquarium trade on biological invasions in the Mediterranean Sea is briefly revised and discussed.
