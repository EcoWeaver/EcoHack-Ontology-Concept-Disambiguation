Scale, connectivity, and incentives in the introduction and management of non-native species: the case of exotic salmonids in Patagonia
Several introduced species have become established throughout large areas of the world, causing millions of dollars in damages. The introduction of such pest species is universally condemned, and science and management efforts are geared toward eradication, containment, or prevention of future infestations. Meanwhile, other organisms are actively traded around the world for consumption, ecreational, and aesthetic purposes, providing examples of the conflict between human development and onservation. When dealing with such species, are there ways to balance the competing goals of conomic production and protection of nature? How can science help to identify suitable compromises? e address these questions by analyzing three case studies dealing with exotic salmonids in Patagonia: trout aquaculture in shallow, fishless lakes; trout recreational fisheries; and marine net-pen salmon aquaculture. We propose that three interrelated properties of these case studies (scale, connectivity, and incentives for conservation) determine our ability to identify and promote situations that balance production and the integrity of nature.
