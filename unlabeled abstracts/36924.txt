Morphology, histochemical test, potential, and conservation effort of Alpinia warburgii K. Schum., a native species to Sulawesi
Alpinia warburgii is a species of the Zingiberaceae family native to Sulawesi. This study aims to characterize the plant morphology; analyze the anatomical structure, histochemical localization, and secretory cell structure of the rhizome; also discuss the potential and conservation effort of the species. Anatomical study and histochemical tests were observed microscopically using the fresh preparation method and wet mounted slide. Histochemical tests carried out include starch, protein, lipid, tannin, alkaloid, and flavonoid. This study is considered the first report of histochemical tests on A. warburgii . The main morphological characteristics of A. warburgii are perennial herbaceous; inflorescence terminal and raceme; flowers white, labellum obovate with red lines in the middle, and flanked by light green edges; fruit globose, green when young and yellow when ripe. The rhizome anatomical structure comprises the epidermis, endodermis, hypodermis, parenchyma, cortex, and vascular bundles, classified as closed collateral type. Histochemical tests showed positive localization for starch, protein, alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins. The density of flavonoids secretory cells is higher than tannins and alkaloids, which indicates its potential as medicine to be associated with antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiinflammation, and anticancer. In addition to in-situ, ex-situ conservation effort through propagation is also important to maintain the species.
