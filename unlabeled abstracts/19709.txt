Predicting the interactions between "ecologically equivalent" indigenous and nonindigenous brachyurans
Predictive models used to determine the impacts of nonindigenous brachyurans on their "ecological equivalents" in marine ecosystems are sorely lacking. Determining the spatial and temporal extent and magnitude of such impacts by nonindigenous species is difficult because of the broad range of qualitative and quantitative criteria currently used to describe their effects. Forecasting potential impacts requires the development of predictive models that incorporate the effects of interspecific interactions and the mechanisms that give rise to these interactions. Successful validation of such models requires improved techniques for measuring and estimating the functional responses on bioenergetic processes across species compositions, abundances, and environmental conditions. Species-specific information used to support predictive modeling of nonindigenous brachyurans is currently heavily biased towards (i) estimating per capita consumption and growth rates in laboratory conditions and (ii) incorporating the effects of abiotic and biotic factors on these measures. Robust predictive models require repetitive experimentation that advances the understanding of species' interactions (beyond consumption alone) across variable densities and considers their effects across different spatial and temporal scales.
