Inferring Invasion Paths Into Cotton by Creontiades dilutus (Hemiptera: Miridae) From Arid Zone and Agricultural Sources
Managing agricultural pests that use multiple host plant species is a challenge when individuals move between host plants in natural vegetation and agricultural environments. The green mirid (Creontiades dilutus) Stal (Hemiptera: Miridae) is endemic to Australia and routinely invades cotton from local uncultivated vegetation, but may also originate from remote locations in the arid continental interior. This bug is polyphagous and highly mobile, which contributes to its pest status in cotton L. (Malvaceae) systems as well as its persistence in arid environments with sparsely distributed ephemeral host plants. The aim of this study was to evaluate how C. dilutus individuals use a variety of host species across remote arid regions and highly managed agricultural landscapes. Structured field surveys spanning vast areas across the Simpson Desert in the arid heart of Australia, as well as subcoastal cotton production systems, were designed to evaluate host use across environments that share few plant species. High numbers of C. dilutus were collected from Cullen australasicum (Schltdl.) J.W.Grimes (Fabaceae) (perennial hosts) and Goodenia cycloptera R.Br. (Goodeniaceae) (ephemeral hosts) in the desert following rain. In agricultural environments, C. dilutus bugs were mostly found on irrigated Medicago sativa L. (Fabaceae) (lucerne), and to a lesser extent Melilotus indicus (L.) All. (Fabaceae) near rivers. Significantly, bugs were on these plants prior to the planting of cotton across all environments surveyed. These data allow inferences relating host use, host abundance, and insect migration to one another to understand the connection that C. dilutus bugs have between arid and agricultural environments.
