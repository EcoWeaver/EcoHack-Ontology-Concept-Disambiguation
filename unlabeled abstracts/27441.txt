Non-Native Aquaculture Species Releases: Implications for Aquatic Ecosystems
Aquaculture is undergoing a rapid worldwide expansion. Of significant concern is the increasing use of non-native species, with subsequent escapes of these species and their associated pathogens and parasites posing a serious threat to native biodiversity, economic value and ecosystem function, particularly in regions rich in endemic species. The contribution of non-native species to the growth of the global aquaculture industry and the economic benefits that it has brought to many developing countries cannot be underestimated. However, minimizing the escapes of non-native aquaculture species must be a high priority for resource managers, conservationists and the aquaculture industry. This paper reviews intentional and unintentional non-native aquaculture introductions and the environmental consequences that escapes can have on the aquatic environment and presents a potential system of risk evaluation, management and funding mechanisms to assist in the long term sustainable development of the aquaculture industry.
