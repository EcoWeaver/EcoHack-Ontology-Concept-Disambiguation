The threat of native-invasive plant species to biodiversity conservation in coastal dunes
Expansion of allochthonous plant species in coastal dunes is recognized as one of the main issues affecting the conservation of this ecosystem. However, some recent studies highlight the detrimental role of certain native species that exhibit invasive behavior within their area of distribution. These species have received little attention from land managers, conservationists, or even scientific researchers, and this can lead to advanced invasions that are difficult to manage and/or restore. Here the potential of autochthonous or even endemic species to become invasive is explored in order to raise awareness of the potential threat they pose to coastal dune ecosystems.
