'Double trouble': the expansion of the Suez Canal and marine bioinvasions in the Mediterranean Sea
''Egypt to build new Suez canal... 'This giant project will be the creation of a new Suez canal parallel to the current channel' said Mohab Mamish, the chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, in a televised speech.''-build-new-suez-canal, viewed August 13, 2014). This is ominous news. Expected to double the capacity of the Suez Canal, the expansion is sure to have a diverse range of effects, at local and regional scales, on both the biological diversity and the ecosystem goods and services of the Mediterranean Sea. Of nearly 700 multicellular non-indigenous species (NIS) currently recognized from the Mediterranean Sea, fully half were introduced through the Suez Canal since 1869 (Galil et al. 2014). This is one of the most potent mechanisms and corridors for invasions by marine species known in the world. Further, molecular methods demonstrate high levels of gene flow between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean populations
