Alien plants in Czech village flora: An analysis of species numbers
Flora of 42 villages located at the territory of the Czech Republic between 12-16 degE and 49-51 degN was analysed to (1) quantify the proportion of archaeophytes (i.e. aliens introduced before 1500), neophytes (aliens introduced after that date) and native species, and (2) assess the factors affecting the representation of these particular groups. Alien species constitute on average about one third of the species present in the flora of a Czech village, archaeophytes contributing 17.8% (32.3 species), neophytes 14.4% (26.8 species). Number and proportion of archaeophytes increased with village size and decreased with its altitude, native species were correlated with neither factor. Village size, expressed as the number of houses, and the distance from a middle-sized town were the significant predictors explaining nearly 50% of variation in number of neophytes. There was also an effect of geographical region in which a village was located on the representation of neophytes. Neither the richness nor the proportion of neophytes in village floras were correlated with the distance from a small town or that from railway, nearest river and main road.
