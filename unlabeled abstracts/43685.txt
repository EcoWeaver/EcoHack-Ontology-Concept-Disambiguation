Controlling Invasive Species: Managing Risks to Australia's Agricultural Sustainability and Biodiversity Protection
Previously, Australia relied primarily upon stringent quarantine controls on imported plant and animal goods to prevent the entry of invasive species. However, the recent introduction of new international rules supervised by the World Trade Organisation, requiring national authorities to demonstrate a 'sound scientific basis' for quarantine measures implemented for plant or animal health purposes, may make it difficult for Australia to rely as heavily upon quarantine as it has done in the past. It is in this context that this article assesses the existing domestic legal and institutional framework for invasive species control as a factor of growing significance, for the management of Australia's biodiversity nd agricultural sustainability.
