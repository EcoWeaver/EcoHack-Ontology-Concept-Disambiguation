Rapid decay of diversity-productivity relationships after invasion of experimental plant communities
So far, effects of species richness on ecosystem functioning have mainly been investigated in the short term in experimental communities from which invasion was prevented. We kept the local species pools of experimental grassland communities with 1, 2, 4, 8, and 32 species closed for five years and subsequently opened them for invasion by cessation of weeding. As long as communities were weeded, extinctions were rare but positively related to species richness, diversity-productivity relationships were positive, and more diverse systems had a greater temporal stability. Following cessation of weeding, species-poor communities were more prone to invasion. However, invasion increased extinction especially in species-rich communities. Within two years, differences in species richness and biomass production between sets of communities of different initial species richness disappeared and the positive diversity-productivity relationship was no longer detectable whereas species compositions remained distinct. This indicates that the positive diversity-productivity relationships during the weeding phase were mainly controlled by species richness.
