A note on the occurrence of non-native tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon Fabricius, 1798) in Biscayne Bay, FL, USA and review of South Florida sighting and species identification
The Asian tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) is considered an established non-native species throughout the greater Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and southeastern United States. A previous investigation on the non-native distribution of P. monodon documented its presence in south Florida. Here we update information regarding its south Florida presence and report our capture of a specimen that may be the smallest tiger shrimp juvenile yet observed in the Western Atlantic Ocean. Continued reports of both adult and juvenile P. monodon from Nov. 2011 through Aug. 2017 suggest that the species is established in the south Florida region. One of several goals of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is to reduce the salinity of nearshore waters to approximate conditions prior to construction of levees, canals, and control structures. An unforeseen consequence of this massive restoration program could be the facilitation of P. monodon population retention and further expansion in south Florida. P. monodon would likely be able to outcompete native species under lower salinity conditions; continued vigilance and laboratory experimentation could improve knowledge of P. monodon's potential advantages.
