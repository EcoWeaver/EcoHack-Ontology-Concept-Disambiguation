Ontogenic shifts in predatory roles involving two invasive species
The red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, and the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki have been introduced worldwide, but the interactions between these invasive species are not well known. The effects of crayfish presence, crayfish size and water depth on the consumption of G. holbrooki by P. clarkii were analyzed, as were the effects of mosquitofish presence and water depth on the consumption of recently hatched crayfish (RHC) by mosquitofish. To better understand this subject we conducted aquaria and open air mesocosm experiments simulating a rice field section. Aquarium experiments showed that P. clarkii consumes G. holbrooki and that G. holbrooki consumes RHC. Adult crayfish size did not significantly affect the consumption of mosquitofish and water depth had no effect on the consumption of G. holbrooki by P. clarkii and vice versa. In the outdoor mesocosm experiments P. clarkii caused no statistically significant effect on G. holbrooki numbers or biomass when compared with controls withou
