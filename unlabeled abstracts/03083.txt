Development of a genomic library of near isogenic lines (NILs) in melon (Cucumis melo L.) from the exotic accession PI161375
A doubled haploid line (DHL) population of melon derived from a cross between the Korean cultivar "Songwhan Charmi" accession PI161375 (SC), included in the horticultural group conomon, and the Spanish cultivar "Piel de Sapo" (PS), included in the horticultural group inodorus, was used to develop a collection of near isogenic lines (NILs). These parental lines represent very different melon cultivar groups, with important differences at fruit, plant, disease response and molecular level. This cross is one of the most polymorphic ones within melon germplasm. Selected DHLs were backcrossed to PS and further backcrossing and selfing was performed, monitoring introgressions from SC using molecular markers covering the melon genetic map. A final collection of 57 NILs was obtained, containing a unique independent introgression from SC in the PS genetic background. The introgressions within the collection cover at least 85% of the SC genome with an average introgression size of 41 cM, corresponding to 3.4% of the SC genome. The average resolution for mapping genes or quantitative trait loci is 18.90 cM. This set of NILs is a potentially powerful tool for the study of quantitative trait locus involved in melon fruit quality and other important complex traits, and the introduction of new genetic variability in modern cultivars from exotic sources. The NILs can also be used as pre-competitive breeding lines in melon breeding projects.
