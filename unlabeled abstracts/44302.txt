The rhetoric of invasive species: Managing belonging on a novel planet
Non-native and invasive species are part and parcel of life on this planet. Via wind, wave, wing, wheel and limb, species move. Over the course of history, most species relocated with little attention until two forces--European colonialism and the invasion sciences--transformed the scale and visibility of species mobility. This study performs a rhetorical analysis of a 2011 dispute in the field of invasion ecology as it ultimately makes visible the legacies of colonialism within the invasion sciences.
