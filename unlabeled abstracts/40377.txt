Life history variation in a temperate plant invader, Verbascum thapsus along a tropical elevational gradient in Hawaii
Few studies have examined the life history of temperate plant invaders in the tropics. Temperate invaders that utilize seasonal cues to influence their life histories may be expected to behave differently in the tropics. This study examined variation in life history in an invading temperate weed, Verbascum thapsus, across an elevation gradient (1,690-2,720m) along the montane and subalpine slopes of Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Over 7,000 seedlings were marked and monitored over a period of 3years. Germination, survival, growth, and reproduction in V. thapsus varied among sites along the elevational gradient. Compared to plants at lower elevations, those at higher elevation sites (>2,000m) had lower early seedling survival, higher established rosette survival, higher vegetative growth rates, higher threshold sizes for flowering, and commonly lived more than 3years before flowering. The abundance of competing vegetation generally decreased with elevation, and this may drive variation in V. thapsus survival and growth. Size-dependent survival appears to play a major role in the selection for smaller size at first flowering and shorter generation time at lower elevations. This pattern is opposite to that reported in temperate mountains where high elevation plants flower sooner and at smaller size, but both patterns appear consistent with general life history theory for biennials. Due to novel biotic and climatic interactions in the tropics, predictions of growth patterns and invasion dynamics for temperate weeds in the tropics can be misleading when based on the plant's behavior in temperate systems.
