Dendroecology of Pinus elliottii Engelm. reveals waves of invasion in a neotropical savanna
Full text available under request or at https://rdcu.be/bRKK2 Despite advances in understanding the ecology and consequences of pine invasions, information on the patterns of structure, dynamics, and growth needed to manage these invasive populations are still poorly known. Here we used tree ring analysis to elucidate growth dynamics, age distribution and fire effects, by sampling three populations of slash pine invading Cerrado vegetation in southeastern Brazil. We found that the invasion occurred in waves, every 5-7 years. These pulses are likely related to the time needed by founder trees to reach maturity, and to climatic events. We found distinct growth patterns among the three study areas. Individual trees in the open sites, under low competition for light, showed an increasing trend of diameter and of the basal area growth rates with age. In the dense stands, however, the diameter increment rates gradually decreased with age, as the competition for light was intensified, and the basal area growth rate increased at lower rates. Growth rates were markedly reduced after fire, likely due to fire impact on the canopies, reducing photosynthesis. Fire scars in the wood allowed us to confirm that the formation of the tree rings occurs annually. When competition for light intensifies as the canopy of the stand closes, the invasive populations experience reduced individual growth of adult trees and constraints to the recruitment of young individuals. Wedid not find, however, evidence of self-thinning due to competition that could reduce the population of adult trees, open gaps and allow colonization by shade-tolerant native species. Therefore, a monodominantpine stand--the ''pine desert'' feature of the invadedsites--tends to be persistent over time.
