Environmental heterogeneity limits the local dominance of an invasive freshwater crustacean
The impacts of an exotic species may vary along environmental gradients. We tested the hypothesis that site-specific heterogeneity in the physico-chemical environment alters the dominance of two competing amphipods: Gammarus fasciatus, the dominant native species in the upper St. Lawrence River, and Echinogammarus ischnus, a euryhaline Ponto-Caspian species that invaded the river in the late 1990s. E. ischnus has replaced G. fasciatus as the dominant amphipod at some sites, while remaining inferior at other sites--even several years after invasion. We tested the effect of water chemistry (conductivity) on the outcome of interactions between these two species in the laboratory and in the river in 2006 and 2007. Field experiments involved transplanting both species to different sites along a gradient of conductivity within the river, whereas the laboratory experiments examined interspecific predation in water collected from these sites. The laboratory experiments revealed that these species are mutual predators and their rate of predation on each other varies with conductivity; E. ischnus is the dominant predator at higher conductivity, while G. fasciatus dominates at lower conductivity. The field experiments showed interannual variation, but supported the lab results at high conductivity in 2006 and at low conductivity in 2007. E. ischnus was more sensitive than G. fasciatus to variation in conductivity, which apparently mediates this invader's ability to replace or dominate the native species in a heterogeneous environment.
