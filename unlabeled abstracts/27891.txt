Familiarity may buffer the adverse effects of relocation on marmosets (Callithrix kuhlii): Preliminary evidence
The relocation of exotic species is increasingly crucial for the proper management of captive populations. We investigated the effects of relocation on urinary cortisol levels and proximity behavior in four Wied's marmosets (Callithrix kuhlii). Two of the relocated marmosets constituted a well-established pair, whereas two (the newly established pair) were introduced when they arrived at the new facility. Four adult females served as control animals in which we assessed cortisol response to pair formation in the absence of relocation. Urinary cortisol in the relocated subjects was monitored for 4 weeks before and 12 weeks after the relocation event. Urinary cortisol in the control subjects was monitored for 4 weeks before and 8 weeks after the pairs were formed. Proximity was monitored in the relocated subjects for 12 weeks following the move. After the animals were relocated, the newly established pair had significantly elevated levels of urinary cortisol compared to the well-established pair and control females, which lasted at least 8 weeks. For both pairs, cortisol levels decreased over time across the 12 weeks following the relocation event. The members of the well-established pair were in contact with each other for 65% of the intervals sampled in the 2 weeks immediately following relocation, compared to only 12% in the newly established pair. These preliminary findings suggest that relocation is associated with significant adverse physiological and behavioral changes that may be ameliorated by the presence of a highly familiar social partner. The study highlights the importance of future research in this field. Zoo Biol 24:93-100, 2005. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
