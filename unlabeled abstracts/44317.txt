REWEAVING NARRATIVES ABOUT HUMANS AND INVASIVE SPECIES
Brendon M.H. Larson, Reweaving Narratives about Humans and Invasive Species Invasive species have become a key theme in environmental science over the past several decades, with our usual conception of them being quite oppositional. Since many of them are here to stay, however, we require a more flexible and evolving conception that can respond to diverse stakeholder perspectives and values. It must also highlight the role of humans in their creation and spread. Here, I present a variety of ways of looking at these species in the hope that they will contribute to more rich discussion about how we might better weave together the presence of humans and invasive species on hybrid landscapes of the future.
