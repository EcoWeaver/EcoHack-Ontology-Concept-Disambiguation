Retention and adaptiveness of photoperiodic EGG diapause in Florida populations of invasive Aedes albopictus
Female Aedes albopictus, F2-F3 descendents from individuals collected as immatures at 6 geographic sites in the USA during 2008, exposed to short daylengths (10 h of light and 14 h of darkness at 21 degrees C) laid eggs in diapause, whose frequency depended upon population origin. Diapause responses in northern Florida and Illinois were strong, as had been reported approximately 10 years earlier for Ae. albopictus from these regions. For southern Florida, the diapause response was polymorphic, and its mean incidence decreased at 2 of 3 collection sites compared to 10 years earlier. Exposure in the field for 2- to 4-wk intervals in Vero Beach (lat 27 degrees 35'N) during January 2009 revealed that eggs laid by short-day females had significantly higher survivorship, even though <50% were estimated, from laboratory results, to be in diapause. Enhanced desiccation resistance may select for retention of diapause in southern Florida.
