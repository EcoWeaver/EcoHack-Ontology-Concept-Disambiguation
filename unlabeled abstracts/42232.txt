MONITORING OF INVASIVE SPECIES DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER AND DROSOPHILA SUZUKII, A SOLUTION FOR OPTIMIZING THE CONTROL STRATEGY AGAINST THE ACID ROT OF GRAPES
In recent years, in the vineyards of central Transylvania the attack of acid rot on grapes combined with Botrytis ( Botrytis cinerea ) A caused considerable harvest losses. Frequently, both diseases are found in equal measure on ripe grapes, and the two diseases can be easily distinguished by the smell of acetic acid and alcohol emanated from diseased beans as well as by the presence of Drosophila melanogaster larvae (the vinegar fly). Surprisingly, in 2014 apart from the species Drosophila melanogaster, a species considered to be the main vector of the disease, a new invasive species from the same family, Drosophila suzukii (the cherry fruit fly) was signaled (TomoiagAf L, Oroian I, 2012; TomoiagAf L 2013, 2014).
