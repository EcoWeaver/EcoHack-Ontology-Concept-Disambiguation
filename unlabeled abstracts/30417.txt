Characteristics of matrix of the invasive freshwater Ectoprocta species Pectinatella magnifica
Pectinatella magnifica (Leidy, 1851) (phylum Ectoprocta) is an invasive species that is spread in many areas of the world. Its significant attribute is the production of large colonies formed by a specific gelatinous matrix which is usually occupied by microorganisms such as bacteria, algae, and cyanobacteria. This work compares the matrix characteristics of P. magnifica from five (in more details from two) locations according to the established criteria: A+B - thin layer (film) or translucent matrix (no contamination with algae and/or bacteria), C - slightly contaminated (discoloration) base, D - compact matrix, internal contamination (green, red, blue), E+F - disintegrating matrix, with a cavity, heavily contaminated (coloration), or without surface texture (inactive colony). Significant differences were identified both in the occurrence of described matrix types, and in the size and shape of P. magnifica colonies in each location.
