Rapid expansion of the distributional range and the population genetic structure of the freshwater amphipod Crangonyx floridanus in Japan
The freshwater amphipod Crangonyx floridanus (Amphipoda: Crangonyctidae) is considered to have been recently introduced from North America to Japan, and the recorded sites at which it has been collected now cover nearly all of Japan except for the northern part. In this study, we surveyed further areas outside of its known distribution range, and examined the population genetic structure and the phylogenetic relationships between Japanese and North American populations of this species based on nuclear (18S rRNA) and mitochondrial (COI) DNA sequences. We found that this amphipod has already reached Hokkaido, northernmost Japan, which suggests that it has undergone rapid expansion in a pattern of concentric circles from the central part of Japan. Genetic analysis showed that the Japanese population is genetically homogeneous, in contrast to the genetic diversification of this species seen in North American Crangonyx populations. The process of introducing, establishing, and expanding this amphipod in Japan may be explained as follows. A limited number of individuals from a North American native population were probably inadvertently introduced and established somewhere within the Kanto region. The local population size then increased and its distribution range expanded rapidly across Japan. KeywordsCrangonyctid amphipods-Alien species-DNA analysis-18S-COI
