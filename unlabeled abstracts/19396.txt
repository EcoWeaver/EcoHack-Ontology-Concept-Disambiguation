Non-interactive effects of plant invasion and landscape modification on native communities
Biological invasions and anthropogenic habitat modification are considered to be the leading drivers of global environmental change, yet their synergistic impacts on native communities remain poorly understood. We tested the effects of an invasive grass, Stenotaphrum secundatum, on an endangered coastal swamp forest community across an anthropogenic land use gradient. We also investigated the relative importance of landscape versus local community attributes in mediating the effects of S. secundatum invasion on the community.
