Biological invasions in the aquatic ecosystems of Europe as a threat to biodiversity
In recent years biological invasions have become a serious ecological and socio-economic problem for many countries. Invasions are promoted by anthropogenic activity which is broadly understood as well as the instability of ecosystems. It carries a number of threats, often difficult to predict. The effects of invasion are long-term and occur on many levels of life. They can very often contribute to the extinction of native species, thus reducing biodiversity. According to the concept of sustainable development, the protection of biodiversity, and thus the prevention of biological invasions, is a necessary condition both to maintain the variety of nature, and to further the economic development of each country.
