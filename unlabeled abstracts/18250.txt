Dispersal of the introduced red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) in Norwegian waters: a tag-recapture study
The aim of this study was to explore the effect of sex, size, region, and density on dispersal rate of the introduced red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) in Norwegian waters. We examined the effect of these factors using logistic regression analysis. Tag-recapture data corrected for fishing effort enabled us to estimate dispersal rates from four main regions along the Norwegian coast: Varangerfjorden, Tanafjorden, Laksefjorden, and Porsangerfjorden. The probability of dispersal was independent of sex and size, but both the logistic regression and the evaluation of corrected tag-recapture data revealed differences in dispersal between region and with increasing duration. The recapture data indicated a relationship between population density and dispersal within research regions but not between population density and dispersal between research regions. Our main conclusion is that there are large individual differences in dispersal ability and the range expansion of red king crab is a result of (i) the presence of long-distance dispersers and (ii) time-dependent slow migration by short distance dispersers. We also conclude that there appears less dispersal in Norwegian waters than in native waters, which might be caused by differences in geographical complexity.
