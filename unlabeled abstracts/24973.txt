Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt in Ireland: an invasive species on the move
The invasive marine macroalga Sargassum muticum was recorded from Kilmore Quay, Co. Waterford, for the first time in the Republic of Ireland in 2001. It was found at several other places in that year and in subsequent years. An intensive survey was carried out from April 2003 to November 2003 to map the geographical distribution and spread of this invasive brown macroalga, and data on distribution were collected in subsequent years through 2006. This study indicated that S. muticum most probably arrived in the early or mid 1990s and has spread all around the Irish coastline colonising Co. Donegal for the first time in 2006. The results indicate that spreading is facilitated by boating and perhaps via shellfish transport. A rough rate of spread of 2-3km year-1 has been calculated within one bay and for the Irish coastline of about 54km year-1. Observations showed that S. muticum has been found growing in seagrass beds and in rock pools, which might have serious consequences for the biodiversity in rock pools and for the protective status of seagrass habitats. It is recommended that monitoring of S. muticum should continue, especially in areas of high amenity value and economic importance in order to observe possible effects on local flora and fauna, aquaculture, the seaweed industry and tourism.
