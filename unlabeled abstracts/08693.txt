Metazoan parasites of Plagioscion squamosissimus, an invasive species in the Tiete River, Sao Paulo, Brazil
Abstract This study focused on the characterization and analysis of communities and infra-communities of metazoan parasites of Plagioscion squamosissimus caught in Promissao Reservoir in the Tiete River in Borborema (21deg39'58"S, 49deg8'49"W), state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Fifty adult specimens caught by professional fishermen in March 2015 were necropsied. The fish presented an average standard length of 25.2 +- 2.2 cm and average weight of 328.82 +- 89.03 g. A total of 5,227 specimens of metazoan parasites were collected: 2,880 (55.1%) adult Diplectanum piscinarius (Monogenoidea: Diplectanidae) and 2,347 (44.9%) Austrodiplostomum compactum metacercariae (Digenea, Diplostomidae), both with 100% prevalence and mean abundance of 57.6 and 46.9, respectively. Parasite diversity was low (species richness = 2), with a Simpson index (D) equal to 0.505, and low values of Brillouin (HB = 0.687) and Margalef diversity (I = 0.117) indices. Berger-Parker's index of dominance (p = 0.551) indicated a slight dominance of the monogenean parasite D. piscinarius. There was a positive correlation, assessed by Pearson coefficient between parasite abundance of D. piscinarius and standard length (r = 0.43) and weight (r = 0.51) of hosts.
