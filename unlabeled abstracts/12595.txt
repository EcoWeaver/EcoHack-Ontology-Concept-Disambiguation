Utilizing environmental information and pricing strategies to reduce externalities of tourism: the case of invasive species in the Galapagos
The increase in demand for nature-based tourism brings economic and educational benefits but risks the introduction of invasive species. Strategies to change the relative prices of trips can induce tourists to choose trips compatible with the conservation of the ecosystem. We hypothesized providing information about the negative externalities of tourism could improve the effectiveness of such pricing strategies. We administered two surveys with discrete choice experiments to tourists. One of the surveys described the Galapagos as a fragile ecosystem susceptible to invasive species; the second described it as a standard nature-based destination. For each sample we estimated the tourist's probability of choosing a short versus long trip, given the tourist's personal information and the trip options available to him. The results suggest the information provided in survey one changed the factors driving respondents' choices, and ultimately changed their choice of trip. Tourists given information on invasive species displayed an elastic demand for short trips; in contrast for tourists without this information, the same demand was inelastic. We used the estimated parameters of the choice models to simulate the demand for trips using three pricing strategies. We found that combining information on invasive species significantly increased the efficacy of strategic pricing.
