Exploring the impact of a non-native seed predator on the seed germination of its non-native host
Novel interactions between introduced and native species commonly occur and can even be predicted from existing native interactions in a certain area. However, novel interactions between two species both alien to a region are less common and can result in intriguing relationships. In this study, we investigate how the North American honey locust Gleditsia triacanthos might benefit from a novel interaction with an Asian monophagous seed beetle Megabruchidius dorsalis, which recently switched its host, in the introduced range of Europe. The honey locust tree is a popular ornamental in Europe and has been reported to escape cultivated areas. We observed spontaneous occurrence of seedlings, saplings, and young trees in the wider urban area of Maribor, Slovenia. We collected mature honey locust pods at several locations and investigated the possible reasons for dormancy break in physically dormant seeds and their successful germination in an urban environment by performing imbibition and germination experiments with variously treated seeds. Our results show that the success of honey locust imbibition and germination can be related to M. dorsalis larva acting as a scarifying agent and thus breaking the seed dormancy, delaying germination, and enabling asynchronous germination. However, the beneficial effect of larvae on germination is possible only if the larva drills the entrance hole, but dies before the seed germinates. Here we show that novel interaction established can occasionally act as mutual facilitation in which each species aids the other to exist and even to increase their invasion success.
