Prediction of Potential Distributions of Two Invasive Alien Plants, Paspalum distichum and Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Using Species Distribution Model in Korean Peninsula
The species distribution model would be a useful tool for understanding how invasive alien species spread over the country and what environmental variables contribute to their distributions. This study is focused on the potential distribution of two invasive alien species, the common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) and knotgrass (Paspalum distichum) in the Korean Peninsula. The maximum entropy (Maxent) model was used for the prediction of their distribution by inferring their climatic environmental requirements from localities where they are currently known to occur. We obtained their presence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and the Korean plant species databases and bioclimatic data from the WorldClim dataset. As a results of the modelling, the potential distribution predicted by global occurrence data was more accurate than that by native occurrence data. The variables determining the common ragweed distribution were precipitation of the driest month and annual mean temperature. Both annual and the coldest quarter mean temperatures were critical factors in determining the knotgrass distribution. The Maxent model could be a useful tool for the prediction of alien species invasion and the management of their expansion.
