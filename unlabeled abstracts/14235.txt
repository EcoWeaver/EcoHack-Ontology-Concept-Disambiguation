The spreading front of invasive species in favorable habitat or unfavorable habitat
Spatial heterogeneity and habitat characteristic are shown to determine the asymptotic profile of the steady states in a reaction-diffusion model with free boundary, which is introduced to describe the moving front of the invasive species. We illustrate how the habitat feature, which is determined by the spatial averages of the birth rate and death rate, affects the spreading and vanishing of the invasive species. Favorable and unfavorable habitats have important applications in determining the spatial patterns for invasive species in the long run. Our results show that the species survives in the new environment for any nonnegative initial value if the initial region is favorable. In an unfavorable habitat, the species dies out if the initial value of the species is small enough. However, long initial occupying habitat, large initial number of the species and slow diffusion are benefit for the species to survive. When the species spreads in the whole habitat, the asymptotic spreading speed is given. Some implications of these theoretical results are also discussed.
