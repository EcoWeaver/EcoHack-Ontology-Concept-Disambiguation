Increased relative abundance of an invasive competitor for pollination, Lythrum salicaria, reduces seed number in Mimulus ringens
When exotic plant species share pollinators with native species, competition for pollination may lower the reproductive success of natives by reducing the frequency and/or quality of visits they receive. Exotic species often become numerically dominant in plant communities, and the relative abundance of these potential competitors for pollination may be an important determinant of their effects on the pollination and reproductive success of co-occurring native species. Our study experimentally tests whether the presence and abundance of an invasive exotic, Lythrum salicaria L. (Lythraceae), influences reproductive success of a co-flowering native species, Mimulus ringens L. (Phrymaceae). We also examine the mechanisms of competition for pollination and how they may be altered by changes in competitor abundance. We found that the presence of Lythrum salicaria lowered mean seed number in Mimulus ringens fruits. This effect was most pronounced when the invasive competitor was highly abundant, decreasing the number of seeds per fruit by 40% in 2006 and 33% in 2007. Reductions in the number of seeds per fruit were likely due to reduced visit quality resulting from Mimulus pollen loss when bees foraged on neighboring Lythrum plants. This study suggests that visit quality to natives may be influenced by the presence and abundance of invasive flowering plants.
