Wetlands as barriers: effects of vegetated waterways on downstream dispersal of zebra mussels
1. Stream flow is a major vector for zebra mussel spread among inland lakes. Veligers have been found tens to hundreds of km from upstream source lakes in unvegetated stream and river systems. It has been suggested, however, that the downstream transport of zebra mussels is restricted by wetland ecosystems. We hypothesized that vegetated waterways, (i.e. wetland streams) would hinder the downstream dispersal of zebra mussels in connected inland lake systems. 2. Veliger abundance, recruitment and adult mussels were surveyed in four lake-wetland systems in southeastern Michigan, U.S.A. from May to August 2006. Sampling was conducted downstream of the lakes invaded by zebra mussels, beginning at the upstream edge of aquatic vegetation and continuing downstream through the wetland streams. 3. Veliger abundance decreased rapidly in vegetated waterways compared to previously reported rates of decrease in non-vegetated streams. Veligers were rarely found more than 1 km downstream from where vegetation began. Newly recruited individuals and adults were extremely rare beyond open water in the wetland systems. 4. Densely vegetated aquatic ecosystems limit the dispersal of zebra mussels downstream from invaded sources. Natural, remediated and constructed wetlands may therefore serve as a protective barrier to help prevent the spread of zebra mussels and other aquatic invasive species to other lakes and ecosystems.
