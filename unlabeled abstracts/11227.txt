First Investigation in the Biochemical Analysis of the Invasive Crab Portunus segnis from Tunisian Waters
The invasive Portunus segnis, an atlantic species, was recently recorded in Tunisian waters. Since its record in the Gulf of Gabes, no studies have been carried out about the biochemical analysis of this alien species. In this context, our study aims to evaluate the fatty acid profile, lipid classes (neutral and polar), and nutritional value of breast of this invasive species. Specimens sampled from the gulf of Gabes were found to be rich in protein and oil, with significant differences between sexes. The level of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids in neutral and polar showed a significant difference between sexes. Saturated fatty acids were significantly higher in male P. segnis compared to the female. Docosahexaenoic (DHA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and arachidonic (ARA) were the most predominate polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in all oil classes. Oleic (C18:1) and Palmitoleic (C16:1) were the most abundant in monounsaturated. Palmitic (C16:0) and Stearic (C18:0) were the major saturated fatty acids. Consequently, the breast of P. segnis was a valuable source of high oil quality: It is rich in essential fatty acids and has an important n-3/n-6 ratio in both male and female blue crab. Therefore, the atherogenicity and the thrombogenicity were also evaluated, showing that P. segnis is a shellfish of greater value for human consumption in Tunisia.
