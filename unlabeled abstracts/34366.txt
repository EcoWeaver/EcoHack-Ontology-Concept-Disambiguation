Seed quantity and quality in fruit heads of Aster lanceolatus Willd.: Implications for invasion success
Aster lanceolatus Willd. is a herbaceous perennial that is considered invasive in many European countries. In Serbia, this plant inhabits wet habitats and forms widespread monospecific stands. The objective of this research is to determine whether generative reproduction has an important role in the expansion of this species to new areas. In 13 different localities, fruit heads were collected from lateral and terminal parts of infructescence. Seed quantity and germination parameters were determined for seeds in the fruit heads. The results showed that the position of the fruit heads did not have a major impact on germination parameters. However, germination parameters differed among the localities. The findings of this study suggest that A. lanceolatus produces a great amount of viable seeds that germinate in an amount sufficient to ensure a successful spread of this invasive species to new areas.
