The tree crown distribution of hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae (Hem., Adelgidae) from randomized branch sampling
  An exotic insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand (Hem., Adelgidae), is spreading through eastern North America, killing hemlock trees [Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere], and thereby impoverishing ecosystems. Adelges tsugae, like many alien invasive insects, is difficult to monitor or sample in the forest. Monitoring of A. tsugae has been hampered by lack of information about its distribution within tree crowns. In order to assist future monitoring and biocontrol of A. tsugae, this study investigates the crown distribution of A. tsugae by sampling from the entire height of mature hemlock trees in a forest with an established infestation. In addition to A. tsugae, sampling includes scale insects, which are another group of important pests on hemlock trees. This study demonstrates the utility of a randomized branch sampling (RBS) plan for monitoring both invasive insects as well as native insects that are difficult to sample. Results from the RBS show that in trees with high populations of A. tsugae, branches from the lower crown have slightly higher densities of A. tsugae than upper crown branches. In trees with low A. tsugae populations, the upper crown may have higher A. tsugae densities than the lower crown. North pointing branches also have higher densities of A. tsugae than branches pointing in other cardinal directions. Future sampling efforts for A. tsugae can take advantage of higher densities in certain portions of the crown to increase accuracy.
