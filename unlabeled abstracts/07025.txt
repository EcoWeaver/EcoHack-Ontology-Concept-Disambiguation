ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE IS NOT EVIDENCE OF ABSENCE: IS STEPHANODISCUS BINDERANUS (BACILLARIOPHYCEAE) AN EXOTIC SPECIES IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION?(1).
The eutrophic, freshwater diatom species Stephanodiscus binderanus (Ku"tz.) Willi Krieg. has long been considered a nuisance exotic alga introduced from Eurasia to the Great Lakes in North America in the early to mid-20th century. However, our paleolimnological data from Lake Simcoe, Ontario, provide unequivocal evidence that this taxon has been present in the Great Lakes region since at least the late 17th century. Subfossil diatom valves were identified and enumerated at high resolution in 210Pb-dated sediment cores from four sites across the lake. The taxonomic identification of S. binderanus was confirmed using an SEM. The historical presence of this species in Lake Simcoe indicates somewhat naturally productive conditions and also refutes the idea that S. binderanus is a nonindigenous species to North America. This study underscores the caution that should be applied to questions of diatom (and protistan) distributions in time and space. Clearly, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
