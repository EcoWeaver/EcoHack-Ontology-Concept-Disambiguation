Reproductive biology of the eastern shovelnose stingaree Trygonoptera imitata from south-eastern Australia
In applying a quantitative approach to the reproduction of Trygonoptera imitata, the present study contributes to understanding the wide diversity in the reproductive biology of the family Urolophidae and provides insights to help determine phylogenetic relationships. This localised species is taken as bycatch in several inshore fisheries and potentially impacted by a range of other anthropogenic pressures, including introduced species, particularly in shallow-water pupping areas. T. imitata can be characterised as a species of comparatively low matrotrophic histotrophy with an extended period of relatively large eggs in utero (5-8 months) followed by rapid growth of the embryos (4-6 months). The reproductive cycle is annual with parturition occurring during late-February-April, followed immediately by ovulation. Mean size-at-birth is ~225 mm total length and there is a ~1000% gain in mean wet mass from egg (15 g) to full-term embryo in utero (150 g), the lowest reported for any viviparous batoid. Litter size increases with maternal length, reaching a maximum of seven, and sex ratio of embryos is 1 : 1. Maximum length and estimates of the maturity-ogive parameters l50 and l95 are similar for females and males.
