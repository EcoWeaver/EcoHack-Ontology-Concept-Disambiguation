Alien terrestrial mammals in Brazil: current status and management
The invasion of alien species is an important cause of biodiversity loss worldwide, and many mammals are considered successful invaders outside their former range, with recognized detrimental effects to native ecosystems. Our aim was to review the current literature on alien mammals that have established feral populations in Brazil and to systematize the existing knowledge. Furthermore, we evaluated the current distributions of all invasion mammals and discuss different management actions, including eradication techniques for island populations. We found 17 species of alien mammals living in the wild in Brazil. Based on the current literature and databases regarding invasive species, Lepus europaeus and Sus scrofa had the largest distributions in the Brazilian territory and seem to continue expanding their geographic distributions. Feral dogs and cats were the main alien predators threatening wildlife conservation, especially in protected areas. Further, we call attention to the invasion of Bubalus bubalis, a large species that currently thrives in isolated populations but seems to be quickly expanding its distribution. In conclusion, alien mammals are widespread in Southern and Southeastern Brazil, but at least four ungulate species (Indian sambar, horse, goat, and axis deer) still have small and isolated populations. Finally, future efforts need to evaluate the impacts of alien mammals in Brazil and techniques for their control.
