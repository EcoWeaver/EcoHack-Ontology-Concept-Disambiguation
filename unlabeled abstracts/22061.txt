Hot water as a potential disinfestation treatment for an invasive anuran amphibian, the coqui frog, Eleutherodactylus coqui Thomas (Leptodactylidae), on potted plants
The Puerto Rican tree frog, or coqui frog, Eleutherodactylus coqui Thomas (Anura: Leptodactylidae), accidentally introduced in Hawai'i in 1988, has negatively affected Hawai'i's $105 million floriculture industry as it acquired quarantine status in Hawai'i, California and Guam. An effective, non-phytotoxic quarantine treatment for E. coqui on potted plants is urgently required. Chemicals available against E. coqui in Hawai'i, citric acid and hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide), can affect plant appearance, are corrosive, and can be hazardous to human health. The potential of hot water, effective against many arthropods, to disinfest potted plants of E. coqui, was examined. In in vitro trials, no eggs hatched after 2 and 5 min at 43 and 45degC, respectively; 100% mortality of adults was achieved by 5 and 1 min at 39 and 45degC, respectively. Most potted plants tested tolerated 45-49degC water for 5-, 10-, or 15-min durations, with a few exceptions where new leaves and flowers were less heat-tolerant. Hot water is an effective disinfestation treatment for E. coqui on most commercially important potted plants.
