Environmental and human factors influencing invasive plant species in Songshan National Nature Reserve
This paper surveys invasive plant species in Songshan National Nature Reserve and analyzes their characteristics and distribution. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) illustrates relationships between environmental and human factors and species distribution. Eight species of invasive plants are distributed throughout the experimental area. Aspect, longitude and human activities influence distribution. Three measures are proposed for better management of the Reserve: reinforce research on invasive species, strengthen public awareness of alien species introductions, and establish laws and regulations to control unwanted introductions.
