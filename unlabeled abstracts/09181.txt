The incidence of exotic species following clearfelling of Eucalyptus regnans forest in the Central Highlands, Victoria
Abstract Invasion by exotic species following clearfelling of Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell. (Mountain Ash) forest was examined in the Toolangi State Forest in the Central Highlands of Victoria. Coupes ranging in age from < 1- to 10-years-old and the spar-stage forests (1939 bushfire regrowth) adjacent to each of these coupes and a mature, 250-year-old forest were surveyed. The dispersal and establishment of weeds was facilitated by clearfelling. An influx of seeds of exotic species was detected in recently felled coupes but not in the adjacent, unlogged forests. Vehicles and frequently disturbed areas, such as roadside verges, are likely sources of the seeds of exotic species. The soil seed bank of younger coupes had a greater number and percentage of seeds of exotics than the 10-year-old coupes and the spar-stage and mature forests. Exotic species were a minor component (< 1% vegetation cover) in the more recently logged coupes and were not present in 10-year-old coupes and the spar-stage and mature forests. These particular exotic species did not persist in the dense regeneration nor exist in the older forests because the weeds were ruderal species (light-demanding, short-lived and short-statured plants). The degree of influence that these particular exotic species have on the regeneration and survival of native species in E. regnans forests is almost negligible. However, the current management practices may need to be addressed to prevent a more threatening exotic species from establishing in these coupes and forests.
