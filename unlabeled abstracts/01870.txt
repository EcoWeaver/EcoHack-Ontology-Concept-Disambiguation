Performance evaluation of indigenous and exotic honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) races in Assir region, southwestern Saudi Arabia
This study was conducted in the Assir region of southwestern Saudi Arabia to compare the activities of honeybee colonies of indigenous Apis mellifera jemenitica (AMJ) and imported Apis mellifera carnica (AMC) during the late summer and autumn of 2009 and 2010. The results showed that the workers of the two races exhibited relatively similar forage timings throughout the period of study (August to November). The highest numbers of foraged workers were recorded at 6:00 am, 10:00 am and 6:00 pm, while the lowest numbers were recorded at 8:00 am, 12:00 pm and 4:00 pm. Although foraging activity was negatively affected by decreased temperature, AMJ was more resistant to cold than AMC. In the first season, the smallest amount of worker brood rearing was recorded in August, and the highest amount of rearing occurred in November in both races. In the second season, the smallest amount of brood was observed in October, and the largest amount of brood was observed in November. Brood rearing and pollen collecting was significantly (P<0.05) higher in AMJ compared with AMC, while AMC stored significantly (P<0.05) more honey than AMJ during the tested periods. In AMJ colonies, a positive significant correlation was observed between the area of the sealed worker brood and stored pollen, while a negative but nonsignificant correlation was observed between the area of the sealed worker brood and surplus honey. In the AMC colonies, a positive significant correlation was observed between the area of the sealed brood and the stored pollen and surplus honey.
