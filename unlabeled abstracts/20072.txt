Non-geographic collecting biases in herbarium specimens of Australian daisies (Asteraceae)
Biological collections are increasingly becoming databased and available for novel types of study. A possible limitation of these data, which has the potential to confound analyses based on them, is their biased composition due to non-random and opportunistic collecting efforts. While geographic biases are comparatively well studied and understood, very little attention has been directed at other potential biases. We used Asteraceae specimen data from Australia's Virtual Herbarium to test for over- and under-representation of plants with specific morphology, phenology and status by comparing observed numbers of specimens against a null distribution of simulated collections. Strong collecting biases could be demonstrated against introduced plants, plants with green or brown inflorescences, and very small plants. Specimens belonging to species with very restricted areas of distribution were also found to be strongly underrepresented. A moderate bias was observed against plants flowering in summer. While s
