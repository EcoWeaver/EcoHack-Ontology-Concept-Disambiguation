Environmental adaptation in an asexual invasive insect.
Parthenogenetic reproduction is generally associated with low genetic variance and therefore reduced ability for environmental adaptation, and this could limit the potential invasiveness of introduced species that reproduce asexually. However, the hemlock woolly adelgid is an asexual invasive insect that has spread across a large geographic temperature gradient in its introduced range. Consequently, this insect has shown significant variation in cold hardiness among populations. We hypothesized that the increased cold hardiness of northern populations represents an adaptation to the colder temperatures. To test this, we collected individual adelgid from populations spanning their invaded range and inoculated them into a common thermal environment. We then experimentally sampled the supercooling point of the progeny of these adelgids and compared these results with tests of the supercooling point of adelgid sampled directly from their source populations. The results showed that the same significant differences in supercooling that was found among geographically distinct populations existed even when the adelgid was reared in a common environment, indicating a genetic basis for the variation in cold hardiness. These findings support the hypothesis that the adelgid has adapted to the colder environment as it has expanded its distribution in its invaded range.
