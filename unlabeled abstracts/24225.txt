Recognition of non-native peacock bass, Cichla kelberi by native prey: testing the naivete hypothesis
Prey naivete is proposed as one of the main reasons behind species extinctions attributed to invasive predators. This study examined whether the naivete hypothesis could explain extinctions after the introduction of peacock bass (Cichla kelberi) in Parana River, Brazil. Our results show that prey responded to both visual and chemical cues of peacock bass. Displayed avoidance behaviors were equal to or greater than those observed with a native predator, Hoplias malabaricus. We conclude that lack of recognition was not responsible for the observed vulnerability of native species to this introduced predator. Finally, we discuss implications of these findings for the native biodiversity and convene other potential explanations for the observed effects of peacock bass on native prey.
