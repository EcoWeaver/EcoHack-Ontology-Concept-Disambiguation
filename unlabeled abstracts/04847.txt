The spread of Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea in the Mediterranean Sea: an example of how biological invasions can influence beta diversity
The present study aims to evaluate if invasion of Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea can affect both alpha and beta diversity in Mediterranean coastal system. The following hypotheses were tested: (i) measures of alpha diversity differ between invaded and non-invaded assemblages (ii) this pattern is consistent between different habitats, (iii) assemblages from habitats which are naturally very different tend to be more similar when invaded compared to non-invaded situations. Results showed that Mediterranean benthic assemblages invaded by C. racemosa var. cylindracea were characterized by lower values of alpha diversity than non-invaded assemblages; moreover, differences between deep (25 m) and shallow water (5m) assemblages appeared lower in invaded than in non-invaded areas, with a decrease of beta diversity. This homogenisation of habitats was related to a lack of several characteristic species and to a higher abundance of few opportunistic species in invaded areas, particularly turf-forming algae. Moreover, variability in taxa composition was lower in invaded than in non-invaded assemblages in both habitats.
