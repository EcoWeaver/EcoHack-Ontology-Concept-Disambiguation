Effects of salinity, temperature and light on germination of invasive Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) D.C
Effects of salinity, temperature, light and their interactions on the rate and final percentage of germination were evaluated for the invasive shrub Prosopis juliflora, grown under arid environmental conditions of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Seeds that were not treated with NaCl germinated well in a wide range of temperatures and in both full light and complete dark. Seed germination decreased significantly with the increase in both NaCl concentration and temperature. Optimal germination percentage occurred at 25degC. The inhibitory effect of high salinity on final germination percentage was greater at 40degC than at 15 and 25degC. Germination was completely inhibited in 400mM NaCl at 40degC and in 600mM NaCl at 25degC. However, germination rate was significantly greater at 40degC than at 15 and 25degC in lower salinities and the reverse was true at higher salinities. Germination in light was significantly greater than in the dark at lower salinity levels and high temperature.
