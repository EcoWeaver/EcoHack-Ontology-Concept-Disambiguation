The Cultural Value of Invasive Species: A Case Study from Semi-Arid Northeastern Brazil
Invasive species are often considered the pariahs of the plant kingdom. In this study, we investigate the utility of native and exotic invasive plants to local residents in a semi-arid area of northeastern Brazil. We address the following questions: Are invasive species considered useful? How are they useful? Are they more or less useful than non-invasive species? Is there a relationship between use categories and taxonomic groups (families, genera, and species)? What plant parts are preferentially used and how are they distributed by categories of usage? And are there differences in the perceived usefulness of native vs. exotic invasive plants? We employed plot sampling of vegetation in anthropogenic habitats. Semi-structured, checklist interviews were carried out with 106 individuals. A total of 56 invasive species were recorded, of which 55 were considered useful. There was no statistical difference in the perceived utility of native vs. exotic invasive species; however, invasive species overall were considered useful more often than non-invasive species. The predominant use was as animal fodder, followed by medicine, food, and technology. Nearly half (44%) of the animal fodder species also served as medicine for people. Herbaceous plants were the most common. Uses varied significantly within taxonomic ranks (species, genus, and family). The most recognized plants were those that are most used locally. This study underscores the value of invasive species in semi-arid Brazil, as well as the need to include local people in regional and national strategies to address invasive species management.
