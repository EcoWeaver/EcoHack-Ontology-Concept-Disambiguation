European weeds and other alien species in the Subantarctic
The species of European weeds which occur as persistent aliens on the subantarctic islands are listed. Their persistence and degree of success in establishment of populations is examined and probable means of introduction suggested for certain species. Poa annua, Cerastium holosteoides and Stellaria media appear to be the most widespread species while Poa annua is undoubtedly the most successful species. Grazing effects can materially influence the spread of introduced species, reindeer on South Georgia having brought about the establishment of pure Poa annua swards. Viable seeds of some species have been found to persist for several years, only germinating under unusual weather conditions. It is concluded that whilst Man's activities have not so far damaged irreparably the floras of any of the islands there is considerable cause for concern for the future.
