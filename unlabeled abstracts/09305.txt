Size of the local species pool determines invasibility of a C4-dominated grassland
The size of the local species pool (i.e., species surrounding a community capable of dispersal into that community) and other dispersal limitations strongly influence native plant community composition. However, the role that the local species pool plays in determining the invasibility of communities by exotic plants remains to be evaluated. We hypothesized that the richness and abundance of exotic species would be greater in C4-dominated grassland communities if the local species pool included a larger proportion of exotic species. We also predicted that an increase in the exotic species pool would increase the invasibility of sites thought to be resistant to invasion (annually burned grassland). To test these hypotheses, study plots were established within two long-term (>20 yr) fire experiments at a tallgrass prairie preserve in NE Kansas (USA). Study plots were surrounded by either a small pool of exotic species (small species pool (SSP) plots; six species) or a larger exotic species pool (large species pool (LSP) plots; 18 species). We found that richness and absolute cover of exotic species was significantly (P
