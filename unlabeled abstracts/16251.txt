Experimental management control ofOpuntia dillenii Haw. andAgave americana L. in Teno Rural Park, Canary Islands
Invasion biology is an important element of global environmental change and represents one of the main threats to biodiversity. American species were introduced to Tenerife after the Spanish conquest during the eighteenth century, as is the case for Agave americana and Opuntia dillenii. The long period of naturalization and adaptation of these species has led them to become two of the most dispersed introduced species of the archipelago. We analyzed several eradication management processes in an area intensively invaded by both O. dillenii and A. americana. Three treatments were randomly applied: mechanical removal, use of herbicide (glyphosate at 10% volume), and mechanical and herbicide applied together. Both the effectiveness of the treatments to remove the target exotic species biovolume and the impact of the eradication methods on species richness and species composition of the area were analyzed. We found that the treatments had an impact on species composition but not on species richness. Species composition was mainly affected by mechanical treatment. The effect caused by the mechanical removal of the exotic target species in species composition is minor after 4 years, and is related to a higher dominance of shrub species typical of coastal shrubland and of annual or pioneer species. The control of O. dillenii and A. americana is evident from insignificant recovery 4 years after treatment application. A mechanical and herbicide treatment together, allowed not only the immediate removal of large individuals but also the herbicidal control of smaller ones.
