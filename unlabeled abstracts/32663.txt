Clonal structure of the introduced freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Prosobranchia: Hydrobiidae), as revealed by DNA fingerprinting
Multi-locus DNA fingerprints were obtained from individuals of the hydrobiid snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum (= P. jenkinsi), by using an RNA derivative (pSPT 18.15) of Jeffrey's 33.15 minisatellite core sequence. Whole-body homogenization of snails yielded 3.21 +/- 0.09 micrograms DNA per individual, producing complex profiles comprising 12-22 fragments within the 1.0-20.0 kilobase (kb) size range. Fingerprints from natural and experimental populations identified three distinct clonal genotypes corresponding to morphological strains A, B and C, with only rare mutational variants. Mother-offspring comparisons of genetic fingerprints revealed genetic stability during apomictic parthenogenesis. Data support the notion that British populations of P. antipodarum comprise three widespread obligate parthenogenetic clones resulting from a mid-19th Century introduction from Australasia. The present-day low levels of genotypic diversity are discussed in relation to the typical occurrence of P. antipodarum in man-made or immature habitats.
