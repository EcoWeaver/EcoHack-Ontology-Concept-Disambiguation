Depth and productivity as predictive parameters for the widespread invasion of Arctodiaptomus dorsalis (Marsh, 1907) (Copepoda: Calanoida) in tropical lakes in the Philippines
AbstractA massive invasion of the Neotropical calanoid copepod Arctodiaptomus dorsalis (Marsh, 1907) has been taking place in the Philippines since at least 1993. This copepod's fecundity is known to depend on food concentration, increasing temperature appears to have detrimental effects on its hatching success and survivorship, but parameters that are truly predictive of the successful integration and propagation of this species in particular bodies of water have not yet been identified. We conducted a spatial analysis of morphometric features and reproductive capacity, the latter proxied by clutch size (CS), of different populations of A. dorsalis inhabiting 11 tropical lakes in the Philippines. Correlations between either morphometry or CS and selected water quality parameters were investigated based on collections and measurements made from December 2018 to April 2019. Means of morphometric measurements differed significantly (P &lt; 0.001) among the populations of A. dorsalis in all lakes. Total length (TL) of adult males, TL of non-ovigerous adult females, and CS of ovigerous females all showed significant (P &lt; 0.001) inverse correlations with lake depth, accounting for about 30% of the observed variability among lakes (r = -0.55, -0.55, and -0.58, respectively). Shallow lakes, which are more homogenous in terms of nutrient distribution throughout the water column, thus provide a more suitable habitat than deep lakes for A. dorsalis and provides a partial explanation of the widespread occurrence and abundance of the species in the shallower, more eutrophic lakes in the Philippines.
