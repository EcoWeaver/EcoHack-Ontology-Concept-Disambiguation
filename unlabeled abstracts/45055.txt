Strain Identification and Herbivore-Host Interaction of Maize Hosting Invasive Alien Pest Spodoptera frugiperda under Elevated Temperature and CO2 Levels
The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda is a recent invasive significant pest of maize in India for the past three years. As, there are two strains reported in S. frugiperda, before proceeding for any studies, it is important to confirm whether the populations introduced belongs to 'R' strain or 'C' strain. PCR-RFLP technique was used to analyze the morphologically indistinguishable host associated strains. The present experiment was planned with PCR amplification of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene followed by restriction digestion with SacI and MspI enzymes. MspI digestion does not shows any restriction, whereas SacI digestion produced restriction fragments confirming the 'R' (rice) strain of S. frugiperda. Biochemical analysis of maize leaves revealed that with an increase in temperature and CO2 levels, there was an increase in carbohydrate, protein, proline, phenol, tannin, and carbon content but the reduction in C:N ratio, vitamin C, and chlorophyll content. The survival of fall armyworm decreased with the progress of age at elevated temperature and CO2 levels. The increased fertility and population outburst were recorded up to 34 degC and 490 ppm. These results signifies that the temperature and CO2 levels above a threshold is detrimental to fall armyworm.
