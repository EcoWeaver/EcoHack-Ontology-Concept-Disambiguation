Prey-baiting as a conservation tool: selective control of invasive ants with minimal non-target effects
Invasive ants are considered a significant threat to urban, agricultural, and natural habitats worldwide and the control of invasions is often a priority for conservation management. The spread and impact of invasive ants is often controlled using chemical management tools, predominantly toxic baits. The preferred outcome of such interventions is the recovery of indigenous species following the removal of the alien invader. Nonetheless, management actions may have unintended consequences such as non-target impacts. Non-target impacts are often a significant concern in areawide eradication programs because toxic baits are typically attractive to a wide range of animals and may kill non-target fauna, especially other invertebrates.
