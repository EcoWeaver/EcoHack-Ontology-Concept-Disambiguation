Plankton Assemblage Variability in a River-Dominated Temperate Estuary During Late Spring (High-flow) and Late Summer (Low-flow) Periods
Seasonally variable freshwater flows are known to influence estuarine plankton assemblages. There has been little recent study of the plankton dynamics of the Columbia River Estuary (CRE), a large, river-dominated estuary that has experienced great modification to its hydrological cycle. Zooplankton (>75 mm) were collected during four late spring (high-flow) cruises and three late summer (low-flow) cruises in 2005 and 2006. Surface-water microplankton (5-200 mm) were collected during cruises in 2005. Zooplankton and phy-toplankton assemblage composition varied along an axial salinity gradient and between flow periods. Estuarine zoo-plankton were strongly seasonal and dominated by the calanoid copepod Eurytemora affinis in the late spring, high-flow period and by the invasive calanoid Pseudodiaptomus forbesi in the late summer, low-flow period. The phytoplank-ton assemblage was dominated by freshwater diatoms, pri-marily Aulacoseira spp. The ciliate Mesodinium rubrum (=Myrionecta rubra) reached high densities during the low-flow period, but otherwise, distinct high-flow and low-flow phytoplankton assemblages were not detected. Comparison to prior studies in the CRE suggests that the plankton assem-blage composition during the low-flow period has undergone considerable change, which may in turn have important tro-phic implications.
