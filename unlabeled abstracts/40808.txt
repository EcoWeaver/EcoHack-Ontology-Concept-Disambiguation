Motivating and engaging volunteer hunters to control the invasive alien American mink Neovison vison in Norway
AbstractInvasive alien species can have widespread negative effects on native biodiversity. We investigated the prospects of engaging hunters in large-scale collaborative efforts to control non-native mink Neovison vison populations in Norway. We invited members of the Norwegian Association of Hunters and Anglers to complete an online questionnaire to ascertain their support for conservation and their level of effort to remove mink, in the context of hunting motivations and bounty payments. The general interest in mink control programmes was low but participants perceived the mink to be of conservation concern. Bounty payments influenced mink catches, with hunters who received payments catching a mean of 4.70 more individuals per hunter than those who did not receive payments (P < 0.001). Mink hunters who preferred to hunt alone and had no preference for hunting locally reportedly caught on average 1.87 more mink per hunter than those who preferred to hunt in company (P < 0.001). The majority of hunters preferred government-led programmes (47%), and investment in bounty programmes (52%) was their main recommendation to improve mink hunting. Hunters can be a valuable component of a mink removal task force and could decrease the likelihood of recolonization of mink in the buffer areas of core conservation target areas.
