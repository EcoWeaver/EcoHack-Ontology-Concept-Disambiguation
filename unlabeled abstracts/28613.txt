Alien invasive species at the Romanian Black Sea coast - Present and perspectives Using literature data and personal field observations we present an overview of aquatic animal alien invasive species at the Romanian Black Sea coast, including freshwater species encountered in this area. We discuss records, pathways of introduction, origin and impact on native communities for some of these alien invasive species. In perspective, we draw attention on the potential of other alien species to become invasive in the study area.
