Individual recognition in Callosciurus finlaysonii (Horsfield, 1824) (Rodentia, Sciuridae) introduced into Italy
A small population, of the Finlayson's squirrel introduced into Italy was studied, distinguishing the individuals according to pelage colour. The border between the dark brown and the white coloration of the frons, the white spots on the dark brown frons and the dark brown side-burns on the white genal-temporal area were characters useful for individual identification. Colour variations during the course of the squirrels' life and colour aberrations in the brood of aberrant individuals were also observed.
