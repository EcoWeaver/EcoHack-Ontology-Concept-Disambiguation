Molecular identification of the exotic slug Arion subfuscus sensu stricto (Gastropoda: Pulmonata) in California, with comments on the source location of introduced populations
Arion subfuscus sensu lato (s. l.) refers to a cryptic slug species complex that is native to Europe and which, from there, has been introduced into the northeastern U.S. The species complex was detected in California for the first time in 2005 and recently 12 specimens were collected during statewide surveys. The genital morphology of these specimens suggested that only A. subfuscus sensu stricto (s. s.) was present and partial sequences of mitochondrial 16S rDNA (443bp) showed that they all belonged to a single haplotype of the mitochondrial lineage, S1 sensu Pinceel et al. (Genetica 125: 155-171, 2005). This result was corroborated by a parallel analysis of a 655bp COI DNA barcode. The 16S rDNA S1 haplotype (S1-03) of the Californian specimens is hitherto known only from the northeastern U.S. Hence, it is likely that populations may have been introduced to California from the northeastern states, rather than directly from the native area of the S1 haplogroup in Europe.
