From peds to paradoxes: Linkages between soil biota and their influences on ecological processes
Soils and their biota have been studied by a variety of observational and experimental methods that have allowed biologists to infer their structural and functional interactions. Viewing progress made over the last 10 years, it is apparent that an increasing diversity of analytical and chemical methods are providing much more detailed information about feeding preferences and niche overlaps of speciose groups such as oribatid mites.Other topics in which considerable progress has been made include new advances in knowledge of root and mycorrhiza production and turnover and their impacts on soil ecosystems; soil biota, exudations and secretions and soil aggregation phenomena; the biology of invasive species in soils; soil biodiversity, legacies and linkages to soil processes; and soil biodiversity and ecosystem functional responses. Throughout the review I suggest ways for new progress to be made in future research.
