A locus encoding variable defence systems against invading DNA identified in Streptococcus suis
Streptococcus suis, an important zoonotic pathogen, is known to have an open pan-genome and to develop a competent state. In S. suis, limited genetic lineages are suggested to be associated with zoonosis. However, little is known about the evolution of diversified lineages and their respective phenotypic or ecological characteristics. In this study, we performed comparative genome analyses of S. suis, with a focus on the competence genes, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and genetic elements related to various defence systems against exogenous DNAs (defence elements) that are associated with gene gain/loss/exchange mediated by horizontal DNA movements and their restrictions. Our genome analyses revealed a conserved competence-inducing peptide type (pherotype) of the competence system and large-scale genome rearrangements in certain clusters based on the genome phylogeny of 58 S. suis strains. Moreover, the profiles of the defence elements were similar or identical to each other among the strains belonging to the same genomic clusters. Our findings suggest that these genetic characteristics of each cluster might exert specific effects on the phenotypic or ecological differences between the clusters. We also found certain loci that shift several types of defence elements in S. suis. Of note, one of these loci is a previously unrecognised variable region in bacteria, at which strains of distinct clusters code for different and various defence elements. This locus might represent a novel defence mechanism that has evolved via an arms race between bacteria and invading DNAs, mediated by MGEs and genetic competence.
