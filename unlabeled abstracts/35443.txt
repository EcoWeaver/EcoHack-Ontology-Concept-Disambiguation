Ecology of Some Native and Introduced Fishes of the Sierra Nevada Foothills in Central California
Collections were made of fishes occurring in the streams of the Sierra Nevada foothills in Central California. Environmental factors associated with each collection were recorded. Correlation analyses indicated which environmental factors affected the distribution of 11 of the 21 species collected: Micropterus salmoides, Lepomis cyanellus, L. macrochirus, Gambusia affinis, Notemigonus crysoleucas, Lavinia exilicauda, Ptychocheilus grandis, Mylopharodon conocephalus, Hesperoleucus symmetricus, Catostomus occidentalis and Salmo gairdneri. The fishes were found to belong to four distinct fish associations, each found in a distinctive set of environmental conditions. The Rainbow Trout Association was found in the cold, clear permanent streams of the higher elevations. The California Roach Association was found in the small, warm intermittent tributaries to the larger streams. The Native Cyprinid-Catostomid Association was found in the larger low elevation streams. The Introduced Fishes Association was found in low elevation intermittent streams that had been highly modified by man's activities.
