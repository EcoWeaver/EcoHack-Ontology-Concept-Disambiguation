Developing novel microsatellite markers by NGS technology for Rhopilema nomadica, an invasive jellyfish
Twelve microsatellite loci, obtained by whole genome sequencing approach, were developed and validated for the rhizostomatid jellyfish Rhopilema nomadica, the most pernicious invasive species in the Mediterranean Sea. A sample of 40 specimens collected at six locations along the Mediterranean coast of Israel were genotyped and all loci presented suitable outcomes to population genetic studies, revealing 5-19 alleles/locus with clean and reproducible amplifications. Observed and expected heterozygosity ranged 0.0.353 to 0.971 and 0.335 to 0.870, respectively, and the fixation index (inbreeding coefficient) and the polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged between - 0.190 and 0.240 and 0.32 to 0.858, respectively. The new set of microsatellite loci will be used to study long-term changes in the population genetic parameters of this invasive species.
