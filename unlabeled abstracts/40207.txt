LIVE BAIT TRADE AS A PATHWAY FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NON-NATIVE SPECIES: THE FIRST RECORD OF Dilocarcinus pagei IN THE PARANAPANEMA RIVER BASIN
Brazil has one of the most significant diversity of freshwater fish in the world, and this drives trade and fishing tourism. Several species of sport fish have characteristics and behaviors that favor fishing tourism and its related activities. Live baits are widely used in fisheries across the country, and at the end of fisheries, is common that anglers may release the remaining bait in rivers, lakes or reservoirs. Here we report for the first time the crab Dilocarcinus pagei in the Paranapanema River basin, and list the freshwater species that were introduced similarly. During field samplings between 2012/2016, and 2018/2019, we captured 10 individuals of D. pagei. One female in the Rosana Reservoir; and two juveniles, one female and six males in the Taquarucu Reservoir. The literature review revealed 16 species used as live bait, the crab D. pagei and 15 fish species. Gymnotiformes were the largest number of species used as live bait. The basins that had introduction cases were in the Upper Parana, Iguacu, and Paraiba do Sul Rivers. The Paraguay-Lower Parana River was the system that contributed with nine species to the most invaded ecoregion in Brazil, the Upper Parana River basin. Anglers and live bait farmers should be aware of the risks and consequences of these constant introduction actions (propagule pressure), not releasing baits. In addition, the live bait trade must be monitored and controlled to occur only with species in their original river basin.
