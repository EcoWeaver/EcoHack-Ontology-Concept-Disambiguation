Quantifying threats in a Mediterranean wetland: are there any changes in their evaluation during a training course?
"Threats analysis" is a conservation discipline directed to identify, quantify, rank, map the human-induced threats occurring in a specific study area, assessing their spatial-temporal regime (e.g., the extension and intensity on specific targets of conservation concern). This approach may be particularly useful in order to define the priorities in the management strategies to be adopted by nature reserves, especially those that are situated in human-altered multi-disturbed contexts. In a remnant Mediterranean wetland of central Italy, where 15 human-induced threats were identified, we compared the assessment given for two regime parameters (scope and severity) of each threat by a panels of not-expert students (n=13) during different phases of a training academic course, thus evaluating perception modifications during three steps. We applied an experience-based method, then comparing the assessments obtained during the training course with the values obtained previously from a panel of experts (n=10). Two direct threats (pollution and alien species) significantly changed their mean values in scope during the three steps, and three threats (habitat conversion, garbage, and aircraft) significantly changed as for severity. Students tended to significantly correct their responses in such a way to progressively match with the experts' responses for a set of threats either for scope (habitat conversion, linear infrastructures, grazing, garbage, fires on reed-beds) or severity (pollution, garbage, fires on reed-beds). Despite the responses were not clear for some threats (aircraft), we suppose that students could assign a initial emphasis towards more charismatic threats as pollution, garbage, fires that instead locally did not appear of priority concern, while threats being uneasily detected (as alien species) were underestimated. Our study showed that a training course with field surveys allows to better define and contextualize the threats affecting a given area, reducing the perception effect that each student had prior to the beginning of the course, when their education information was mainly mass-media based.
