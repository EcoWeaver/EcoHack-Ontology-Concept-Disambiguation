First record of the Ponto-Caspian invasive crustacean Chelicorophium sowinskyi (Martinov, 1924) (Amphipoda, Corophiidae) in the French Rhone River
The study and monitoring of invasive species is valuable, because of their potentially negative impact on ecosystems and possibly connected economic interest. In France, the majority of invasive species in fresh waters are Ponto- Caspian crustaceans (Devin et al., 2005). Since the beginning of the 21st century, the amphipod Chelicorophium curvispinum (Sars, 1895), originating from brackish waters of the Danube estuary, has spread throughout western Europe (Tachet et al., 2010). It has been recorded in France in 1991 (Genin, 1992). Now also Chelicorophium sowinskyi (Martinov, 1924) (fig. 1), known since decades from the Hungarian-Slovakian part of the Danube (Borza et al., 2010), has been found for the first time in France during studies in the framework of the scientific programme monitoring the ecological and hydrological restoration of the Rhone River (http:// restaurationrhone.univ-lyon1.fr).
