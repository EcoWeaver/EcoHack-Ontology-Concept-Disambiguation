First record of the non-native sea snail Haminoea cyanomarginata Heller & Thompson, 1983 (Gastropoda: Haminoeidae) in the Southern Mediterranean Sea
The present paper documents the further spread of the invasive, non-indigenous sea snail Haminoea cyanomarginata Heller & Thompson, 1983 in the Mediterranean Sea. Since its original description in the Red Sea, this sea slug has been subsequently reported since 2001 from various locations throughout the Central, Eastern, and Western Mediterranean Sea. This is the first record of H. cyanomarginata in Libyan waters and the whole Southern Mediterranean Sea.
