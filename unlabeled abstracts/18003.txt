Evaluation of glyphosate application in regulating the reproduction of riparian black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) after clear-cutting, and the possibility of leaching into soil
Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.)--an invasive alien species in riparian forests--is becoming more prevalent in many rivers of eastern Japan. Riparian black locust forests are typically cut down to maintain river-flow capacity. However, such forests often reproduce rapidly by stump sprouting and root suckering and regenerate by germination. Thus, more effective riparian forest management approaches are required. To regulate the reproduction of black locust forests after clear-cutting, we examined the regrowth-inhibiting effects of glyphosate herbicide application to stumps, in accordance with current river management protocol (i.e., winter logging operation). Further, we investigated the concentrations of glyphosate leaching into the soil at a depth of 30 cm in a riparian area of the Tenryu River. Our results showed that glyphosate application to stumps completely inhibited stump sprouting but not root suckering or seedling germination. The glyphosate concentration leaching into the soil reached a maximum (2.6 +- 0.7 mg kg-1, mean +- standard error) on day 1 after the application, and subsequently declined to below the detection limit on day 2. Thus, the rapid degradation of glyphosate was confirmed, despite the fact that the herbicide leached into the soil after application to the stumps. The glyphosate application has limited effectiveness against root suckering and germination of riparian black locust forests after clear-cutting in winter, in accordance with the current river management protocol.
