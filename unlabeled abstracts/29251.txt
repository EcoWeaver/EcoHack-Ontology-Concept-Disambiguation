Effects of multiple mating on the fecundity of an invasive pest (Octodonta nipae): the existence of an intermediate optimal female mating rate
Multiple mating is found in many insect taxa where both of the sexes can mate more than once. For males, this leads to the advantage of increasing their paternity by fertilizing more females. However, there is a trade-off of resource allocation between reproduction and other life-history characters. In the present study, the impact of increased mating rate on reproductive fitness of the invasive nipa palm hispid beetle Octodonta nipae Maulik (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is investigated. A series of mating frequencies (i.e. 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 times) is selected from video frame playback, ranking from the minimum to maximum mating rate observed under laboratory conditions over a given time period. Fecundity parameters such as lifetime egg production, egg-hatching rate, effective oviposition period and longevity are investigated for the evaluation of reproductive efficiency. For female O. nipae, increased fecundity is correlated with the mating frequency. Females mating 15 times lay the largest number of eggs (138.82 +- 6.87) and have a hatching rate of 47.43 +- 4.08%. After mating 20 times, females suffer significant declines in oviposition (90.31 +- 8.38 eggs) and egg-hatching rate (34.16 +- 4.93%). Moreover, the population growth rate reaches a maximum in the females that mate 15 times. The results show that multiple matings in O. nipae have an intermediate optimal range within which female reproductive success is enhanced, providing empirical evidence for the existence of a trade-off between costs and benefits during copulation based on resource allocation.
