Trophic consequences of non-native pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus for native pond fishes
Introduced non-native fishes can cause considerable adverse impacts on freshwater ecosystems. The pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus, a North American centrarchid, is one of the most widely distributed non-native fishes in Europe, having established self-sustaining populations in at least 28 countries, including the U.K. where it is predicted to become invasive under warmer climate conditions. To predict the consequences of increased invasiveness, a field experiment was completed over a summer period using a control comprising of an assemblage of three native fishes of known starting abundance and a treatment using the same assemblage but with elevated L. gibbosus densities. The trophic consequences of L. gibbosus invasion were assessed with stable isotope analysis and associated metrics. In L. gibbosus presence, the trophic breadths of all three native fishes were substantially reduced compared with those measured in their absense. This strongly suggests their increased diet specialisation in L. gibbosus presence, with this aligning strongly with the niche variation hypothesis, which predicts populations become less generalized in their diet under conditions of increased inter-specific competition. Moreover, native gudgeon Gobio gobio also demonstrated a concomitant and significant reduction in their trophic position and somatic growth rate. Some of the patterns observed in the experiment were also evident in two nearby quasi-natural pond fish assemblages invaded by L. gibbosus, with similar trophic ecology and position of larger-bodied L. gibbosus, and similar patterns of niche partitioning with G. gobio. The implications of these results for present and future invaded pond communities are discussed.
