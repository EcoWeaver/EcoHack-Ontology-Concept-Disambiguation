Vegetation analysis on wetlands in a Tuscan agricultural landscape (central Italy)
The plant communities on the wetlands of an agricultural landscape in central Italy were studied. Indicator species, dominant life forms, alien species cover and prevailing habitat conditions (using Ellenberg indicator values) were shown to characterize the four groups that emerged from a classification analysis. 31 vegetation units were documented by 98 original phytosociological releves and a floristic, synecological and distributional description was presented with syntaxonomic notes for each unit. A new association, Rorippo amphibiae-Potentilletum reptantis, was described. The high phytocoenotic diversity, the 7 coenoses belonging to habitat of Community or regional interest and the higher risks affecting these wetlands in an anthropic countryside (eutrophication, invasion of alien species, human modifications of the landscape) underline the fact that these wetlands are of high conservation value and the goal of protecting this very important environment.
