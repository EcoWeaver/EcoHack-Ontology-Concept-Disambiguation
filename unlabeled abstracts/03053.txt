Competitive ability and fitness differences between two introduced populations of the invasive whitefly Bemisia tabaci Q in China
Background Our long-term field survey revealed that the Cardinium infection rate in Bemisia tabaci Q (also known as biotype Q) population was low in Shandong, China over the past few years. We hypothesize that (1) the Cardinium-infected (C+) B. tabaci Q population cannot efficiently compete with the Cardinium-uninfected (C-) B. tabaci Q population; (2) no reproductive isolation may have occurred between C+ and C-; and (3) the C- population has higher fitness than the C+ population. Methodology and Results To reveal the differences in competitive ability and fitness between the two introduced populations (C+ and C-), competition between C+ and C- was examined over several generations. Subsequently, the reproductive isolation between C+ and C- was studied by crossing C+ with C- individuals, and the fitnesses of C+ and C- populations were compared using a two-sex life table method. Our results demonstrate that the competitive ability of the C+ whiteflies was weaker than that of C-. There is that no reproductive isolation occurred between the two populations and the C- population had higher fitness than the C+ population. Conclusion The competitive ability and fitness differences of two populations may explain why C- whitefly populations have been dominant during the past few years in Shandong, China. However, the potential role Cardinium plays in whitefly should be further explored.
