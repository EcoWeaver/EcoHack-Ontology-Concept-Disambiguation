ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INVASIVE PEST OF BAMBOO DINODERUS JAPONICUS LESNE, 1895 (COLEOPTERA BOSTRICHIDAE) IN THE CAUCASUS AND NOTES ON OTHER BEETLE SPECIES CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED IN THIS REGION
Dinoderus japonicus Lesne, 1895, a beetle native to East Asia, is firstly recorded in Russia and the Caucasus. In May 2016 three specimens of this serious pest of bamboo were collected in the thicket of Phyllostachys sp. in Sochi (near the Black Sea Coast in the South of European Russia), where bamboo is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant. Probably this record represents a successful establishment, since the likelihood of catching three individuals from a current introduction, rather than from a breeding population, is vanishingly small. Dinoderus japonicus was often intercepted in Europe, but did not establish until recently. However in 2012-2013 established populations were found in France and Italy. The record of one more population - in the Caucasus - indicates that the pest potentially could be established in any region of Europe, where bamboo is cultivated. Therefore, it is recommended to survey bamboo plantations in all regions for this pest. The populations of at least 14 alien beetle species have been firstly recorded in European Russia in Sochi since 2000. Special phytosanitary measures should be taken in this region to prevent future invasions.
