Arctic Warming Ripples through Eurasia
Arctic warming provides an excellent demonstration of the teleconnections within and between the natural and societal systems at global, regional, and local scales. This paper examines climatic and related environmental changes occurring in the Arctic and discusses how the changes may cascade throughout the world, with particularly pronounced effects in parts of Eurasia. The paper outlines numerous manifestations of a warming Arctic climate, including reduced Arctic ice cap thickness and extent, reduction of the continuous permafrost zone, and changes in the conditions of terrestrial and marine habitats in the Far North. It explores how these changes have already affected human activities in the area, creating both potential opportunities and problems in Arctic marine transportation, access to renewable and non-renewable resources, economic development, national security, and safety. Another focus of the paper is on how changes in the Arctic are likely to affect Eurasia, as well as other parts of the world. It is suggested that Eurasia will be affected by climate change directly and will also have to respond economically and socially to specific changes that are taking place in the Arctic in mid (10-30 years) to long (30 years and beyond) time frames.
