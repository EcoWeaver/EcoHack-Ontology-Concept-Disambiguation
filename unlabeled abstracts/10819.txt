Hybridization of alien and aboriginal taxons of Bidens L. genus in Eastern Europe
Earlier it was suggested, based on study of the morphological features, that a new taxon of burmarigold, which had been noted in recent decades in several locations on the territory of Russia and neighboring countries and described as an alien species of Bidens connata, is in fact a hybrid species that arose in Europe. This hypothesis was confirmed by the molecular genetic method. A complex of taxa of the genus Bidens from various parts of the areal and their F1 first generation offspring were studied, and a polymerase chain reaction was performed using ISSR primers. It was established that the taxon investigated represents a complex of hybrids and recurrent hybrids that arose in the European part of Russia independently by hybridization of the alien B. frondosa and the aboriginal B. cernua.
