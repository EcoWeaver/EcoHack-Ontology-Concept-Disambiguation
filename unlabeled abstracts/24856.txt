Field records of painted apple moth (Teia anartoides Walker: Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) on plants and inanimate objects in Auckland, New Zealand
Abstract  As part of an eradication program, field searches were conducted to verify the geographical extent of the painted apple moth (PAM; Teia anartoides Walker: Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) incursion and to determine which plants were being attacked. Most PAM were found on the wattle species, in particular Paraserianthes lophanta and Acacia mearnsii. Other species with large numbers of PAM included the native Corynocarpus laevigatus (karaka) and Avicennia marina (grey mangrove). The large number of PAM on these New Zealand species would not have been predicted from the known unrelated Australian hosts. The relatively high number of PAM found on inanimate objects demonstrated the mobility of PAM larvae and that plants upon which few larvae were found may not be suitable hosts for PAM.
