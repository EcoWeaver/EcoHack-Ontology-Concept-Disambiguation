Field Observations on the Mating Behavior of Aclees sp. cf. foveatus Voss (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), an Exotic Pest Noxious to Fig Orchards
Aclees sp. cf. foveatus Voss is a new and exotic pest recently reported as responsible for severe damages to Italian fig orchards and nurseries. Investigating its mating behavioral sequence could help to unravel mate assessment and choice dynamics of this pest, adding useful information to build-up behavior-based control strategies. In this study, we observed A. sp. cf. foveatus mating behavior under field conditions. The mating behavior is divided into precopulatory, copulatory and postcopulatory phases. Simultaneous antennal tapping and rostral rubbing acts performed by the male on female's body raises male's chances to copulate, while males that performed only antennal tapping on the partner's body did not achieved mating success. Copulation attempt phase lasted 37.80 +- 7.65 s. Copulation lasted 1116.00 +- 229.73 s and was followed by a motionless postcopulatory phase (8.40 +- 1.21 s). Same-sex sexual interactions were observed among A. sp. cf. foveatus males. Male-male sexual interactions lasted about 140.17 +- 19.45 s and were composed of antennal tapping and rostral rubbing followed by one or more mounting attempts. Further research is ongoing to investigate the exact nature of male- and female-borne olfactory and tactile cues routing mate recognition in A. sp. cf. foveatus.
