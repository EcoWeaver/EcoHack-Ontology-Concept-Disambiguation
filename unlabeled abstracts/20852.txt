Coping with invasive alien species: the Argentine ant and the insectivorous bird assemblage of Mediterranean oak forests
Cork oak forests invaded by the Argentine ant Linepithema humile have a lower abundance and biomass of arthropod prey for birds than uninvaded forests. We studied whether the biomass of breeding insectivorous birds was also lower in invaded areas. We explored this and other possible effects of the ant invasion on the bird community by censusing birds in transects located in four invaded and four uninvaded forest sites in Catalonia (NE Spain) for 3 years. Redundancy analysis showed only slight differences in the community composition between forests. Two insectivorous species, Luscinia megarhynchos and Fringilla coelebs, tended to be less abundant in invaded areas although two others, Phylloscopus bonelli and Sylvia melanocephala, showed the opposite trend. Overall, the differences in prey biomass between invaded and uninvaded areas did not entail a biomass shift in the guild of insectivorous birds, regardless of whether they were shrub or canopy foragers. The main role of the habitat structure in determining bird densities and food resources being non-limiting in the studied forests are two possible non-exclusive explanations for this inconsistency. At today's levels, the Argentine ant invasion does not appear to have greatly determined the insectivorous bird assemblage of the forests evaluated.
