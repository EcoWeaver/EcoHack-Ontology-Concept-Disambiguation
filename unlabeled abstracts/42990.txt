Distribution of Melaleuca rugulosa (Schlechtendal ex Link) Craven (Myrtaceae) in South Africa: Assessment of invasiveness and feasibility of eradication
Several Melaleuca (Myrtaceae) species are invasive globally. Recently an increase in invasive species from this genus have been reported in South Africa. Here we document the first detailed assessment of the distribution and invasive potential of Melaleuca rugulosa in South Africa. We assess population structure, determine the current and potential future distribution in South Africa using climatic variables, conduct a risk analysis, provide recommendations for management, and consider the feasibility of eradication. We found one naturalis-ing population of >>665 individuals covering more than 1.2 hectares. It was first recorded in 1961 invading the native fynbos vegetation in the Table Mountain National Park (TMNP). Two recent fires A in 2009 and 2016 A likely enhanced spread, this spread happened despite undocumented clearing attempts in the last decade. The southwestern Cape is the most climatically suitable for M. rugulosa, with most other wetter areas of the country being only partly suitable regions. The risk analysis indicated a medium risk, and we suggest listing M. rugulosa as category 1a (eradication target) under the South African National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (10/ 2004). Given the small area occupied, ease of access and the lack of a soil seed bank, the population can be extirpated from Devil's Peak within the TMNP. We highlight that serotinous alien species, particular from the Myrtaceae, should receive more attention as potential invasive species in fire-driven ecosystems and that their lack of invasiveness in areas where fire is suppressed, should not be misinterpreted as being a low-risk species.
