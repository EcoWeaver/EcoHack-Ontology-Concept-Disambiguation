Massive invasion of Arctodiaptomus dorsalis (Copepoda, Calanoida, Diaptomidae) in Philippine lakes: a threat to Asian zooplankton biodiversity?
A study originally intended to update the systematics and zoogeography of calanoid copepods in Philippine lakes has led to the discovery of an invasion by the Neotropical Arctodiaptomus dorsalis. It now occurs in 18 out of 27 lakes in the archipelago. Only four of the 12 previously recorded native and endemic calanoids have been encountered in the lakes, which may indicate that most have been displaced by A. dorsalis, although a general deterioration of water quality by fish culture may also have contributed to a suppression of the local fauna. Undescribed species may have been affected as well. A. dorsalis was first reported in the Philippines from Laguna de Bay in 1991, where it was said to have been introduced via ship drinking water reserves, but co-introduction with tilapia is more probable. Intensive aquaculture practices during the past 20 years have aided its dispersal to other areas and have provided environmental conditions that favor its survival. The rapid spread of A. dorsalis, paralleled by a loss of calanoid diversity in the Philippines, may repeat itself if this opportunistic species succeeds in spreading to mainland Asia.
