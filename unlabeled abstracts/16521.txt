The need of more rigorous assessments of marine species introductions: a counter example from the Brazilian coast.
The Brazilian Ministry of the Environment organized in 2004-2005 a national program to evaluate the existing information on invasive species in terrestrial and aquatic biomes. A list of 58 exotic species of planktonic and benthic invertebrates, fish, macroalgae, and phytoplankton, updated till late 2008, was generated in a marine ecosystem assessment study carried out by a group of 14 specialists, including three invited reviewers (Lopes, 2009). The study made use of a conservative approach by only including species with well-supported evidence of introduction, based on established criteria (e.g., Chapman and Carlton, 1991). Evidently, lists of exotic or introduced species need to be accurate because they shall serve as fundamental elements for public conservation policies, influencing economic and social stakeholders. Periodic re-assessment of such validated lists is clearly necessary, but the same concern and criteria followed by Lopes (2009) shall be applied unless new arguments or data demonstrate incorrectness or caveats in his approach.
