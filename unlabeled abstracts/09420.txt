Temporal Changes in Gametogenesis of the Invasive Chinese Pond Mussel Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834) (Bivalvia: Unionidae) from the Konin Lakes System (Central Poland).
Gametogenesis and the temporal changes occurring in the ovaries and testes throughout the reproductive cycle in the invasive alien bivalve, Chinese pond mussel Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea), from the heated Konin lakes system (central Poland) were studied using histological techniques. S. woodiana was confirmed to be a gonochoristic species with overall sex ratio of 1:1. The examined morphological parameters of Chinese pond mussel spermatozoa, i.e. 42 mm mean total length; 4.3 mm mean head length and the maximum size of previtellogenic (34-43 mm) and vitellogenic oocytes (75-83 mm) are consistent with values established for closely related members of the Unionidae family. Our results suggest that S. woodiana in the Konin lakes system are able to spawn throughout March to October, with a season of higher reproductive activity in females extending from March to April. This type of reproductive biology may contribute to the Chinese pond mussel's success in thriving in freshwater ecosystems.
