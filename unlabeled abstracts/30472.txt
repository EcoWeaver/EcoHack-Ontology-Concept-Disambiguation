Invasion patterns across multiple scales by Hieracium species over 25 years in tussock grasslands of New Zealand's South Island
Studying patterns of species invasions over time at multiple spatial scales may help us to elucidate important factors driving those patterns and how they change according to temporal or spatial resolution. Here we provide a large, long-term, landscape-scale study of the invasion of three Hieracium species using a dataset that encompasses vegetation change on 124 transects over 25 years across the lower eastern South Island of New Zealand. We investigated the relationships between key environmental and ecological factors and the invasion trajectories of H. lepidulum, H. pilosella and H. praealtum, at two spatial scales: (i) among-transect colonization and (ii) within-transect changes in frequency and per cent cover. Our results show that the colonization and spread of Hieracium species among and within transects reflect (i) the importance of initial environmental and biological conditions, (ii) that our sampling captured different periods of the invasion trajectories of each of the three species, and (iii) the effects of differences in life histories of the three species.
