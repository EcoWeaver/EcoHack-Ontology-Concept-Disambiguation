Distribution and abundance of the invasive tunicate Ciona intestinalis (Linnaeus, 1767) in Icelandic harbours
Ciona intestinalis is within the group of taxa that are spreading globally and is one of the most thriving invasive marine species, known to depress both species richness and abundance at a local scale in distinct geographic areas. It is a dominant biofouling agent, associated with the decreasing economic incomes from aquaculture operations around the world. Ciona intestinalis was first observed in 2007 at Straumsvik in Southwest Iceland. The present study was designed to provide general information on its current distribution across Icelandic harbours. The species was found only on the SW coast of Iceland, in dense aggregations reaching up to 876 ind/m2 in all harbours from Grindavik to Akranes. The current work provides information that can be used to track the dispersal of C. intestinalis populations along the Icelandic coast and for the development of effective management decisions.
