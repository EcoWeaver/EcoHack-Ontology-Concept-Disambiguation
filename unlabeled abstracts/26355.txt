Costs and benefits of stock enhancement and biological invasion control: the case of the Bay of Brest scallop fishery
This paper deals with the economic impact of the invasion of a scallop fishery by an exotic shellfish that was accidentally imported some decades ago. The invasive alien species, a slipper-limpet, Crepidula fornicata, is a space competitor for local scallops, and its spread threatens the sustainability of the ongoing scallop restocking program. Facing this invasion, the local fisheries committee has initiated a containment project intending to make the restocking program consistent with the exotic species presence in the fishery. The issue is complicated by the occurrence of occasional toxic micro-algae blooms affecting the scallop fishery. The paper presents a model dealing with the economic impact of the invasive process, and a methodology for cost-benefit analysis of invasion management. According to numerical simulation, the invasion is a serious threat to the economic viability of the restocking program, and invasion management would help maintaining the long term sustainability of the fishery. Sensitivity tests highlight the importance of long term equilibrium scallop catches on the program result, depending on scallop farming technical performance and ecosystem disturbance.
