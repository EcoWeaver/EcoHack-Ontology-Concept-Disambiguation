Rangia cuneata (G. B. Sowerby I, 1831) continues its invasion in the Baltic Sea: the first record in Parnu Bay, Estonia
This paper documents the arrival of the non-native bivalve Rangia cuneata in a shallow-water basin of Parnu Bay, north-eastern Gulf of Riga, Baltic Sea, Estonia. The bivalve was collected for the first time in October 2016. The species occurred at low densities along a 25-km stretch of coastline. The size distribution suggests R. cuneata is established in the study area. This species represents the first obligatory suspension-feeding soft bottom bivalve in this low salinity area. Consequently, R. cuneata has a potential to intensify benthic-pelagic coupling as well as to improve the overall water quality of the bay. As Parnu Bay is the northernmost location of the species' geographic range, winter temperature likely controls the species survival and further spread in the region.
