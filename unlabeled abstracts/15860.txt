Integrating ecology into green roof research
Green roofs can provide environmental benefits that include increased building insulation, mitigating urban heat islands, providing aesthetic value, reducing runoff and storm water flooding in urban environments, improving air quality by sequestering pollutants, cooling photovoltaic panels to improve their function, and providing habitat for fauna and flora. Until very recently, improvements of green-roof environmental services had been achieved largely by horticulturalists, engineers, and architects. In recent years, ecologists have increased their participation, implementing ecological theory for enhancing biodiversity, and selecting specific plant assemblages for other environmental services such as carbon sequestration and for providing cooler roofs. Moreover, ecologists can use green roofs as relatively novel habitats for testing and developing ecological theory. This special issue is devoted to fostering input from ecologists for advancing the environmental and ecosystem services of green roofs. A wide range of ecologists can explore the topic of the ecological aspects of green roof design and implementation including island biogeography theory, niche theory and null models, the role of environmental heterogeneity, invasion ecology, and plant selection. They can contribute ecological methodology and study design for strong inference.
