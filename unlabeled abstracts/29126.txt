Invasive Ring-Necked Parakeet Negatively Affects Indigenous Eurasian Hoopoe
The Ring-necked Parakeet invaded southern Israel and competes with indigenous cavity-nesting species for nest sites. However, the parakeet can also excavate its own cavities and thus may provide other birds with breeding places, so the final impact on native avifauna is questionable. We studied the effect of the Ring-necked Parakeet on the indigenous Eurasian Hoopoe during 10 year in 2000-2009. The parakeet colonized two palmeries (in 2002 and 2006) with the highest densities of the Hoopoe while two remaining palmeries remain unsettled by the parakeet over the study period, and thus are control plots in our study. In the unsettled palmeries the breeding density of the Eurasian Hoopoe has not changedfor the 10 yearswhile in palmeries colonized by the Parakeet, density of the Hoopoe has significantly declined over the same study period. Moreover, the palmery originally hosting the highest density of the Hoopoe had the lowest density of this species after the invasion of the parakeet. The results suggest a negative impact of the invasive Ring-necked Parakeet on the indigenous Eurasian Hoopoe, mainly through the aggressive takeover ofcavities by parakeets. Expected land-use changes in the region will most probably result in further expansion of the Ring-necked Parakeet.
