FIRE EFFECTS ON PLANT DIVERSITY IN SERPENTINE VS. SANDSTONE CHAPARRAL
Fire contributes to the maintenance of species diversity in many plant com-munities, but few studies have compared its impacts in similar communities that vary in such attributes as soils and productivity. We compared how a wildfire affected plant diversity in chaparral vegetation on serpentine and sandstone soils. We hypothesized that because biomass and cover are lower in serpentine chaparral, space and light are less limiting, and therefore postfire increases in plant species diversity would be lower than in sandstone chaparral. In 40 pairs of burned and unburned 250-m 2 plots, we measured changes in the plant community after a fire for three years. The diversity of native and exotic species increased more in response to fire in sandstone than serpentine chaparral, at both the local (plot) and regional (whole study) scales. In serpentine compared with sandstone chaparral, specialized fire-dependent species were less prevalent, mean fire severity was lower, mean time since last fire was longer, postfire shrub recruitment was lower, and regrowth of biomass was slower. Within each chaparral type, the responses of diversity to fire were positively correlated with prefire shrub cover and with a number of measures of soil fertility. Fire severity was negatively related to the postfire change in diversity in sandstone chaparral, and unimodally related to the postfire change in diversity in serpentine chaparral. Our results suggest that the effects of fire on less productive plant communities like serpentine chaparral may be less pronounced, although longer lasting, than the effects of fire on similar but more productive communities.
