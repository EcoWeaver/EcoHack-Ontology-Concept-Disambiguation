The invasive Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) in the Czech Republic: Repetitive introduction events highlight the need for extended entomological surveillance
In the framework of a regional collaborative project between authorities and scientists, evidence was found of repeated introduction of Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) alongside the main road entrances (E461 and E65) connecting Austria and the Slovak Republic with the Czech Republic. In comparison to data from 2012 (17 specimens collected on three occasions), the seasons 2016 (66 specimens on ten occasions) and 2017 (90 specimens on eight occasions) show an apparent increase of introduction events as well as of mosquito numbers and underline the need for more intense surveillance activities.
