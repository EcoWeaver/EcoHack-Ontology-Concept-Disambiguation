Dangerous invasive harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Pallas, 1773) (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) in the European Russia
The harlequin ladybird (Harmonia axyridis) is recorded in Belgorod oblast. This species has established itself in 38 countries of North America, South America, Europe, and Africa in the last 24 years. Mass propagation of this beetle in a number of regions has led to the decline of local ladybird species and other insects. The harlequin ladybird is a significant pest of fruit and wine production. H. axyridis is a nuisance that infests houses in large numbers when searching for overwintering sites. Hungry beetles bite people. The fluid excreted by these beetles has a foul odor, stains furniture and walls, and causes an allergy. The harlequin ladybird should be included in the list of quarantine species of the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Supervision of Russia.
