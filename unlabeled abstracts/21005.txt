Redescription and new records ofCeltodoryx ciocalyptoides(Demospongiae: Poecilosclerida)--a sponge invader in the north east Atlantic Ocean of Asian origin?
In 1996 a sponge was found in a well studied area in the Ria of Etel, Brittany, France, that had never been recorded there before. This sponge was later described as a new species and genus,Celtodoryx girardaeby Perezet al.(2006), who concluded that it is probably an invasive species. Over several yearsC. girardaewas found to occur successively in the Gulf of Morbihan, France, and Oosterschelde estuary, Netherlands. This sponge is characterized by an extensive spatial broading and therewith it rates today among the dominant benthic megafauna in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Morbihan and Dutch inshore waters. During our recent survey of the Chinese Yellow Sea sponge fauna, we found an abundant species with close morphological similarities toC. girardae. Further taxonomic studies have revealed that both the Chinese and European sponges are in fact conspecific withCornulum ciocalyptoidesdescribed by Burton (1935) from Posiet Bay, Sea of Japan and later recorded from other localities of the North West Pacific (e.g. Koltun, 1971; Sim & Byeon, 1989). In this paper we transfer the species of Burton fromCornulumtoCeltodoryxand consequently it becomes the senior synonym ofC. girardae. Furthermore, we conclude thatCeltodoryx ciocalyptoideswas introduced to the North East Atlantic from the North West Pacific with aquaculture of the Pacific oysterCrassostrea gigasas the probable vector. This is probably the first case recorded so far of a sponge species being transferred from one ocean to another by human activity.
