Does Prunus serotina act as an aggressive invader in areas with a low propagule pressure?
Since most studies on Prunusserotina in Western Europe focused on heavily invaded areas, we wondered whether P.serotina also acts as an aggressive invader in areas with a low propagule pressure. Based on long-term data for the Liedekerke forest reserve, we found that connectivity to seed sources and light availability were the major drivers of P.serotina presence: long-distance dispersal events and 'windows of opportunity' seem to direct P.serotina colonization. In the studied forest, P.serotina could not be considered an aggressive invader since its spread slowed down rather quickly and did not hamper the establishment of native tree species. Furthermore, understory P.serotina showed low growth and seed production, while the high Rubus cover hampered germination and establishment. Nonetheless, calamities opening up the canopy layer in the few areas with high P.serotina sapling density might alter the course of the invasion process.
