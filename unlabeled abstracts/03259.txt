Invasive plants have broader physiological niches
Significance Invasibility (the vulnerability of a receiving environment to invasion) and invasiveness (the capacity of an organism to invade) are fundamental metrics in theoretical ecology. However, attempts to apply these concepts to the question of whether an introduced species will invade have failed. Here, we use a model that characterizes the physiological niche of plants to successfully predict invasive success of 749 species. We find that, although invasive success is dependent on different factors in different ecological contexts, the modeled global potential range of species integrates these contingencies to produce a reliable and interpretable indicator of the likelihood that a species will reproduce and spread.
