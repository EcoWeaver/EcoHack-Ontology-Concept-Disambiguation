UnmaskingAureliaspecies in the Mediterranean Sea: an integrative morphometric and molecular approach
Molecular analyses have increased knowledge of the number and distribution of morphologically cryptic species in the world's oceans and, concomitantly, the identification of non-indigenous species (NIS). However, traditional taxonomy and accurate delimitation of species' life histories and autecology lag far behind, even for the most widely distributed taxa such as the moon jellyfish Aurelia species complex. Here we analyse mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and nuclear 28S ribosomal DNA (28S) gene sequences to assign polyps, ephyrae, and medusae collected in the Mediterranean Sea to different phylogenetic species. We find evidence for three Aurelia species, none referable to the type species of the genus, A. aurita, and describe the anatomical, morphometric, and developmental variation within and between them. We identify A. coerulea and A. solida as established non-indigenous species (NIS) in the Mediterranean Sea. We describe A. relicta sp. nov., an endemic species currently unique to a population in the marine lake of Mljet (Croatia). These results demonstrate the usefulness of integrative approaches to resolve taxonomic uncertainty about cryptic species complexes, identify patterns of marine biodiversity, and recognize NIS in marine ecosystems.
