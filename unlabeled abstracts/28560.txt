Effect of large-scale environmental variables and human pressure on distribution patterns of exotic continental fish in east Algeria
This study aims to identify large-scale environmental variables that explain the distribution of continental exotic fish across five bioclimatic regions in east Algeria (160,000 km2), North Africa. Fish communities were sampled at 39 sites from 2007 to 2010. Seven environmental variables were investigated: habitat type, altitude, latitude, longitude, bioclimatic region, minimum and maximum air temperatures and human pressure. The common carp (Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758) and the silver carp (Hypophtalmichthys molitrix Valenciennes, 1844) were the most widespread exotic species. Almost all exotic fishes were distributed over desert and sub-humid bioclimatic scales. Reservoirs represent the type of habitat that houses the greatest exotic species richness. The distribution pattern of exotic fishes was mainly predetermined by the type of habitat. Alien ichtyofauna colonizes primarily man-made hydrosystems regardless of environmental variables or the degree of human pressure, making these habitats more vulnerable to invasion.
