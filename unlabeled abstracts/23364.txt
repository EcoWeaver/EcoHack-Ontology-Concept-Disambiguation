Across island and continents, mammals are more successful invaders than birds (Reply)
Aim The establishment success of exotic species is calculated as the fraction of introduced species that have become established, and invasion success is estimated as the fraction of established species that have spread significantly from their points of introduction. Records on species introductions are highly incomplete, so strong conclusions about the tens rule and invasibility of island and continents cannot be drawn. Location Global. Methods Using Jeschke (2008) as an example, we explain the issue of the inadequacy of data to draw conclusions about the tens rule and invasibility of island and continents. Results Lack of adequate data. Main Conclusion Jeschke (2008) probably overestimates the establishment and invasion success rates, so his conclusions about violation of the tens rule and that islands are not more susceptible to invasion than continents are misleading.
