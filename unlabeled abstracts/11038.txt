The loss of native biodiversity and continuing nonindigenous species introductions in freshwater, estuarine, and wetland communities of Pearl Harbor, Oahu, Hawaiian Islands
The benthic invertebrates and fishes of the estuarine, lower stream areas, and wetlands of Pearl Harbor were sampled from 1997-1998 as a companion study to marine inventories conducted in Pearl Harbor. The first comprehensive assessment of the area found that nonindigenous species comprise the dominant portion of the biota. A total of 191 aquatic species in 8 phyla were identified in the estuarine reaches of Pearl Harbor. Nonindigenous species dominated and comprised 48% of the species, whereas only 33% were native and 19% were cryptogenic. Two new nonindigenous species to Hawaii were found during this study: a species of fang-toothed blenny (Omobranchus ferox) and an estuarine hydrobiid snail (Pyrgophorus cf.coronatus) introduced from the Philippine Islands and the Caribbean, respectively. No single geographic region predominates as a source of aquatic species introductions into the Pearl Harbor area, although more species come from the Americas than other areas. Fifty-seven percent originated from the Americas, 30% from Asia and the Pacific, 5% from Australia/New Zealand, 5% show a world-wide distribution, and fewer than 3% of species originated from Africa. The majority of nonindigenous species appear to arrive from five major sources: intentional and accidental aquarium releases; intentional biocontrol releases; intentional food source releases; ballast water or hull fouling releases; and brought in with airplanes. Non-native species will likely continue to increase in the freshwater and estuarine portions Pearl Harbor because of the wide variety of sources from which introductions take place.
