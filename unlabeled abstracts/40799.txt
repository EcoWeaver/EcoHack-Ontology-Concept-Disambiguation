Polyploidy as a Management Strategy for Invasive Species
Most invasive species are prolific seed-producing landscape ornamental plants that have been introduced to non-native habitats with limited or no natural controls on their reproduction and spread. Techniques for converting prolific seed-producing landscape ornamentals into sterile or nearly sterile forms are available. Oryzalin and colchicine have been used to double chromosomes, resulting in autotetraploids with reduced fertility and potential parent plants of sterile triploids. Guard cell measurements and flow cytometry have been used to determine ploidy conversion and identify polyploids. Complete sterility has been achieved in three species of shower trees (Cassia sp.), and up to a 95% reduction in seed production has been achieved in royal poinciana (Delonix regia) and african tulip tree (Spathodea campanulata). Monkey pod (Albizia saman) crosses have produced triploid progeny to evaluate for sterility.
