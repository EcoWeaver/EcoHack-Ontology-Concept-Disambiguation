Effect of Storage Conditions on the Oil Quality of Chinese Tallow Tree Seeds
The Chinese tallow tree (TT) has been widely considered to be an invasive species in the US without potential benefits. However, the literature on TT seeds is scarce and the effect of storage conditions on seed oil quality in particular has not been published to our knowledge. Prior research revealed that TT has a very high yield of seeds containing large percentages of long and short chain fatty acids (mainly palmitic fatty acid, along with some oleic, linoleic and linolenic fatty acids), which can be base transesterified into biodiesel. This study aims to address the issue of the quality of the kernel oil of TT seeds stored at different temperatures (4degC and room temperature) and under controlled atmosphere storage conditions (3% CO2, 6% CO2, vacuum, normal headspace). The total storage time was 3months with the oil quality being analyzed weekly. Extracted oil was analyzed by titratable acidity, peroxide value, oxidative stability index and fatty acid composition. These experiments provided evidence that, after 12weeks of storage, a controlled atmosphere did not produce any remarkable advantage over low cost air storage. The results validate the belief that no elaborate storage conditions are required to store this economically promising high oil content biofuel feedstock.
