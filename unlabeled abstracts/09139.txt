Flowering Ecotypes of Capsella bursa-pastoris(L.) Medik. (Brassicaceae) Analysed by a Cosegregation of Phenotypic Characters (QTL) and Molecular Markers
Capsella bursa-pastoris(Brassicaceae) is an annual to biennial predominantly autogamous species distributed worldwide. Using a linkage map with RAPDs and isozymes we studied quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling phenotypic traits in this invasive species. To obtain a mapping population we crossed two plants occurring in different climatic regions in California, USA (Central Valley and Sierra Nevada) with the most diverse ecotypes (phenotypic parameters) and genotypes (isozyme multilocus genotypes). A hundred and thirteen F2individuals were raised and analysed for segregation at 107 RAPDs, six isozyme loci, and one locus determining leaf type. The number, location and magnitude of genes underlying 13 traits were determined by using both interval and composite interval mapping. Two to five QTL affecting one character have been detected. Altogether the 13 quantitative traits produced 48 QTL. The inheritance patterns of traits ranged from those controlled by one QTL with a major effect to those controlled by several QTL with only minor effects. Closely linked QTL, e.g. onset of flowering with rosette leaf number, were interpreted as pleiotropic. Three major QTL account for onset of flowering. These loci were linked to at least three isozyme loci and several other QTL responsible for developmental traits like rosette leaf number. Heritability of quantitative traits, segregation of the leaf type, and segregation of the allozymes was tested in the F3generation. We conclude that historical events alone are insufficient to explain the distribution pattern of isozyme multilocus genotypes during the colonization of new regions and habitats. The present evidence indicates that ecotypic adaptation and genetic linkage of isozyme loci with adaptive characters are involved.
