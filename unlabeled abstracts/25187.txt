Assessing invasion risk across taxa and habitats: life stage as a determinant of invasion success
Aim Many aquatic invertebrates produce dormant life-history stages as a means to endure inhospitable environments and to facilitate natural long-distance dispersal, yet we have little understanding of the role of dormant stages as a mechanism for human-mediated introductions of non-indigenous species. We explore the survival of invertebrate dormant eggs in collected ships' ballast sediment over a 1-year period to determine relative invasion potential across taxa (i.e. rotifers, copepods, cladocerans and bryozoans) and different habitats (freshwater, marine).
