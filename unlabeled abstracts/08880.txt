Development of microsatellite loci for the invasive weed Wedelia trilobata (Asteraceae).
Unlabelled: Premise of the study: Microsatellite markers were developed to help elucidate the population genetics of the invasive species Wedelia trilobata. * Methods and results: Using the Fast Isolation by AFLP of Sequences COntaining (FIASCO) repeats protocol, 23 sets of primers for amplifying microsatellite loci were identified in W. trilobata, 10 of which showed polymorphism (two to five alleles per locus) in samples of two populations of W. trilobata, one from China and one from Peru. Six of these loci were successfully amplified from samples of the native congener W. chinensis, with expected sizes. * Conclusions: These markers may be useful for further investigation of population genetics of Wedelia trilobata and other congener species.
