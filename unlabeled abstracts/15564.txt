Storms on Venus: Lightning-induced chemistry and predicted products
Observations by many spacecraft that have visited Venus over the last 40 years appear to confirm the presence of lightning storms in the Venus atmosphere. Recent observations by Venus Express indicate that lightning frequency and power is similar to that on Earth. While storms are occurring, energy deposition by lightning into Venus atmospheric constituents will immediately dissociate molecules into atoms, ions and plasma from the high temperatures in the lightning column (>30,000 K) and the associated shock waves and heating, after which these atom and ion fragments will recombine during cooldown to form new sets of molecules. Lightning will re-sort the atoms of C,O,S,N,H to create highly energetic new products. Spark and discharge experiments in the literature suggest that lightning effects on the main atmospheric molecules CO2, N2, SO2, H2SO4 and H2O will yield new molecules such as mixed carbon oxides (CnOm), mixed sulfur oxides (SnOm), oxygen (O2), elemental sulfur (Sn), nitrogen oxides (NO, N2O, NO2, NO3), sulfuric acid clusters (HnSmOx-.aHnSmOx e.g. HSO4-.mH2SO4), polysulfur oxides, carbon soot, and also halogen oxides from HCl or HF and other exotic species. Many of these molecular species may be detectable by instruments onboard Venus Express. We explore the diversity of new products likely created in the storm clouds on Venus.
