Invasion by alligator weed,Alternanthera philoxeroides, is associated with decreased species diversity across the latitudinal gradient in China
Aims Invasive species occurrence and their effects on biodiversity may vary along latitudes. We examined the occurrence (species cover) and relative dominance (importance value) of invasive alligator weed, Alternanthera philoxeroides, in its terrestrial habitat in China through a large-scale latitudinal field investigation. Methods We established 59 plots along the latitudinal transect from 21degN to 37degN. We recorded species name, abundance, height and individual species coverage of plants in every quadrat. We then measured a-species diversity variations associated with the A. philoxeroides community across the latitudinal range. We also analyzed the effect of latitude on plant species' distributions in this community by using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Important Findings We found that species cover and importance value of A. philoxeroides increased in areas
