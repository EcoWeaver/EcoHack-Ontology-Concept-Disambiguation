Asexual plants change just as often and just as fast as do sexual plants when introduced to a new range
Some of the world's most economically and environmentally damaging introduced species reproduce asexually. While sexually reproducing introduced herbs have proven capable of rapid evolution, no previous study has quantified morphological changes in multiple obligatory asexually reproducing introduced species, or asked whether their potential for change differs from that of sexual species. We measured herbarium specimens of eight asexual species introduced to Australia and/or New Zealand. We quantified changes in leaf area, leaf shape, leaf mass per area, plant height and internode length through time since the species' introduction. Half of the asexual species demonstrated significant change in at least one trait. The observed changes were substantial - up to 561% per 100 years. The proportion of species showing at least one significant morphological change did not differ significantly between our asexual species, and data measured in the same manner for 34 sexually reproducing introduced species. There was also no significant difference in the rate of morphological change in sexual versus asexual species. That is, we found that sexual species have not changed more often, or more quickly than their asexual counterparts. Our results show that asexually reproducing species can undergo rapid morphological change at a rate matching that of sexually reproducing species when introduced to a new range. Our results also suggest that asexually reproducing plants may be able to respond to changing conditions better than was previously appreciated.
