Invasive Asian earthworms of the genus Amynthas alter microhabitat use by terrestrial salamanders
Invasive earthworms are rapidly transforming detrital communities in North America. Recent studies have investigated the effects of European earthworms, whereas Asian earthworms, such as species of the genus Amynthas Kinberg, 1867, remain understudied. Amynthas is a surface-dwelling earthworm that voraciously consumes the litter layer of temperate forest floor habitats. The accumulation of detritus is important for the terrestrial Eastern Red-backed Salamanders (Plethodon cinereus (Green, 1818)) because this microhabitat provides the matrix through which salamanders travel when foraging, searching for mates, and dispersing. We examined the effect of Amynthas on the activity of "naive" (no history of co-occurrence with Amynthas) and "experienced" (recent co-occurrence with Amynthas) salamanders in laboratory microcosms. We hypothesized that earthworms would disturb normal salamander activity through the reduction of leaf litter and physical impediment, with greater negative effects on naive salamanders encountering this "novel" invasive species. Consistent with published studies, earthworm presence significantly decreased leaf-litter mass over time. Prior experience with earthworms did not appear to influence salamander response. However, earthworm presence had a significant effect on salamander activity, with salamanders exhibiting increased movement, cover-object use, and co-occurrence under cover objects with earthworms as the study progressed. Unnecessary movement has the potential to incur fitness costs to salamanders in the form of energetic expenditure and increased exposure to predators.
