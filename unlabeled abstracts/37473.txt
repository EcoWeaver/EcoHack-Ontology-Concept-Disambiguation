The efficacy of message frames on recreational boaters' aquatic invasive species mitigation behavioral intentions
Aquatic invasive species (AIS) management often requires a human-centered focus that entails communicating with resource-users about needed mitigation behaviors. Messaging is a common communication practice to this end, and evaluating how messaging influences user behavior is an essential component. To test the effects of messaging on AIS mitigation behavioral intentions, 1,338 participants were randomly assigned to one of four message framing conditions: standard, regulation, descriptive, and injunctive. Overall, a significant effect of message framing was observed, with regulation-framed messages garnering significantly higher intentions. Further analysis revealed a significant main effect of messaging among participants reporting low frequencies of past behaviors. Similar results were found among participants reporting stronger perceived barriers to AIS mitigation behaviors. We discuss these results in relation to other message framing studies, their managerial implications, and future research directions.
