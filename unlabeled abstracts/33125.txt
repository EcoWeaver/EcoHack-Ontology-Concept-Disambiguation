Comparison of allelopathic effects of two typical invasive plants: Mikania micrantha and Ipomoea cairica in Hainan island
AbstractMikania micrantha and Ipomoea cairica are two invasive plants widely distribute and seriously damage in Hainan island. In this study, the leaves extracts of two weeds were collected and determined for their allelopathic potentials on Chrysanthemum coronarium. The phytotoxicity bioassay showed that when the extract concentration was 50 and 100 mg/ml, the inhibited effects of M. micrantha on growth of C. coronarium were greater than by I. cairica. However, when the extract concertation at 400 mg/ml, the opposite inhibited effects were observed. We speculated this phenomenon was caused by different allelopathic compounds. Therefore, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, 19 and 23 compounds were identified respectively, benzoic acid and cinnamic acid were the main components in the two leaves extracts, which were selected to carry out the further bioassays. Subsequent bioassay results showed the effects of two allelochemicals on morphological index and chlorophyll content and POD activity were all negative to C. coronarium, whereas the content of MDA and activity of SOD, CAT represented adverse changes. Moreover, the inhibitions by cinnamic acid were generally greater than those by benzoic acid. Thus, the phenolic acids played the most crucial roles in the allelopathic effccts of M. micrantha and I. cairica leaves extracts.
