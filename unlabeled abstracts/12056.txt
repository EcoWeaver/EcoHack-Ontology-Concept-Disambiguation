First record of alien species Eualetes tulipa (Rousseau in Chenu, 1843) from the Royapuram fishing harbour at Chennai, India
Eualetes tulipa (Rousseau in Chenu, 1843), a marine worm snail (family Vermetidae), was collected in the Royapuram fishing harbour, Chennai, coast of India. The identity of the species, initially based on morphology, was confirmed by molecular analysis (cytochrome oxidase I). Collected from submerged boulders of a breakwater at depths from 0.5 to 1.0 m, this represents the first record of the species from the coast of India. Its population density at the site was up to 55 individuals /m2. Elsewhere, Eualetes tulipa has been recorded as an invasive species from the coasts of Hawaii and from Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea. The source of its introduction was likely fouling from the hull of a ship, although transport in ballast water is also possible.
