Genetic structure of introduced European fallow deer (Dama dama dama) in Tasmania, Australia
European fallow deer are an introduced species classified as partly protected wildlife in Tasmania, Australia. Current management practices are primarily governed under the Quality Deer Management regime, in which animals are harvested during designated hunting seasons. Among populations, prominent morphological differences have been reported; however, the genetic relationship of these populations has until now been poorly understood. Representative animals were sampled from three key areas across their range and genotyped at ten polymorphic microsatellite loci to investigate genetic diversity, population structure, and genetic bottlenecks. Allelic richness was low in all three populations and ranged between 2.20 and 2.49 alleles/locus. A genetic bottleneck was detected in two of the three populations (P < 0.001). Population differentiation was evident between Lake Echo and Benham (q = 0.122; P < 0.001) and Benham and Connorville (q = 0.110; P < 0.001), but not between Lake Echo and Connorville (q = 0.0235), with individuals being identified as belonging to two genetic clusters. The pattern of population differentiation from the three study populations suggests that deer from the western region of their range are genetically distinct to those from the eastern region. This correlates with morphological variation within Tasmanian fallow deer, in which differences between the regions maybe attributable to geographical barriers.
