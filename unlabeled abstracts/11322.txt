Isolation and characterization of microsatellite primers for an invasive weed, Solanum rostratum (Solanaceae).
We developed microsatellite primers and tested the polymorphism of seven populations of Solanum rostratum distributed throughout their range in China. These will be useful for biologists to study the mating systems and genetic diversity and differentiation of S. rostratum in its native range in Mexico and in its current distribution throughout the world. Five polymorphic microsatellites were identified for Solanum rostratum. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 1 to 8 (average = 4) for 195 individuals examined from seven populations. The observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.000 to 1.000 and 0.000 to 0.778, respectively. These five markers can be used in studies examining population genetics and the mating system of Solanum rostratum to investigate its invasive mechanisms and to provide information for developing management strategies for this species.
