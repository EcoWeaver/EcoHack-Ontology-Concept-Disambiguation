Gymnocoronis spilanthoides(Asteraceae, Eupatorieae), a new naturalized and potentially invasive aquatic alien in S Europe
Gymnocoronis spilanthoides, a naturalized South American neophyte introduced as an aquarium and aquatic ornamental plant, is recorded for the first time from southern Europe. Two populations were found in irriga- tion canals and in a rice field in northern Italy. Distribution, invasion status, ecology, and pathways of introduction of the species are presented. Additionally, the modes of dispersal, never investigated before in the European continent, are discussed and the potential invasive behaviour and impacts in the new growing sites are assessed.
