Functional traits of alien plants across contrasting climatic and land-use regimes: do aliens join the locals or try harder than them?
1 Two main views have been put forward to explain whether coexisting alien and resident plant species should show converging or diverging functional attributes. According to the 'try-harder' hypothesis, successful aliens should differ from resident species with traits that allow them to deal better with the local conditions than resident species. On the other hand, the 'join-the-locals' hypothesis stresses the importance of filtering by environmental factors and predicts strong functional trait similarities between alien and native species, especially among the dominants.
