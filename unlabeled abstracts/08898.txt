Germination and establishment of the invasive cordgrass Spartina densiflora in acidic and metal polluted sediments of the Tinto River
Heavy metal pollution is common in rivers in the vicinity of mining areas. In these polluted environments, the survival of alien species with a high tolerance to metals may be favored. The Tinto River (Southwest Iberian Peninsula) is an excellent natural laboratory for the study of plants' responses to acidic and metal polluted sediments. This work analyzes the tolerance of the alien species Spartina densiflora to low pH and high metal loads in the Tinto River. The main aim of this study was to determine if this alien species can invade landward along the banks of the Tinto River. S. densiflora seeds were able to germinate in heavy metal polluted aerobic sediments even at pH 2. However, these conditions decreased S. densiflora final germination, altered germination dynamics, decreased aerial and subterranean growth rates, and prevented its establishment.
