Long-term changes in the fish assemblage of the Laja River, Guanajuato, central Mexico
1.The structure and composition of fish communities in rivers of central Mexico have been altered as a result of water over-exploitation, habitat fragmentation, introduction of exotic species, and pollution. However, the specific pattern and degree of change are poorly documented.2.Long-term information from the Laja River (Guanajuato, Mexico) in the Lerma River basin was used to explore trends in fish species richness and community composition (species origin, trophic niche, tolerance, and preferred habitat) from the 1960s to the present in both river and reservoir sites.3.Declines in native, sensitive, benthic native and carnivore species ranging from 11% to 30% per decade, and increases in the number of tolerant and exotic species by 9-20% per decade, are documented. Repeated measures ANOVA and sign tests revealed significant declines in the number of benthic, native, carnivore and sensitive species. Species richness, number of exotics, tolerant species and omnivore species did not change statistically, though statistical power was low. Some important changes occurred in these variables, such as the expansion and establishment of exotics such as Xiphophorus variatus and Micropterus salmoides, which pose a serious potential threat to native species.4.The changes in fish community composition for the Laja portray how the fish communities in other rivers in central Mexico, for which long-term data do not exist, have changed or could change if environmental deterioration continues.
