Modeling metal bioaccumulation in the invasive mussels Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis in the rivers Rhine and Meuse.
The metal-specific covalent index and the species-specific size-based filtration rate were integrated into a biokinetic model estimating metal bioaccumulation in mussels from the dissolved phase and phytoplankton. The model was validated for zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) mussels in the rivers Rhine and Meuse, the Netherlands. The model performed well in predicting tissue concentrations in different-sized zebra mussels from various sampling sites for (55) Mn, (56) Fe, (59) Co, (60) Ni, (82) Se, (111) Cd, (118) Sn, and (208) Pb (r(2) =0.71-0.99). Performance for (52) Cr, (63) Cu, (66) Zn, (68) Zn, and (112) Cd was moderate (r(2) <0.20). In quagga mussels, approximately 73 to 94% of the variability in concentrations of (82) Se, (111) Cd, (112) Cd, and (208) Pb was explained by the model (r(2) =0.73-0.94), followed by (52) Cr, (55) Mn, (56) Fe, (60) Ni, and (63) Cu (r(2) =0.48-0.61). Additionally, in both zebra and quagga mussels, average modeled concentrations were within approximately one order of magnitude of the measured values. In particular, in zebra mussels, estimations of (60) Ni and (82) Se concentrations were equal to 51 and 76% of the measurements, respectively. Higher deviations were observed for (52) Cr, (59) Co, (55) Mn, (56) Fe, (111) Cd, (63) Cu, and (112) Cd (underestimation), and (66) Zn, (68) Zn, (208) Pb, and (118) Sn (overestimation). For quagga mussels, modeled concentrations of (66) Zn and (68) Zn differed approximately 14% from the measured levels. Differences between predictions and measurements were higher for other metals.
