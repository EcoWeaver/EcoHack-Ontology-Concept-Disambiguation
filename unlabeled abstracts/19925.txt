The invasive New Zealand mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, is an effective grazer of algae and altered the assemblage of diatoms more than native grazers
Exploitation of shared resources often mediates the impacts of invasive species on native species. In a field experiment, we compared the ability to graze periphyton and the genera of diatoms removed by the invasive New Zealand mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a native caddisfly larva (Brachycentrus sp.), and a native mayfly nymph (Ephemerella sp.) over 1 week. P. antipodarum removed as much or slightly more periphyton than the native grazers, depending on whether chlorophyll a or ash-free dry mass was used to measure periphyton biomass. When we examined the diatoms in the periphyton, P. antipodarum altered the diatom assemblage more than the native grazers. Effective grazing of periphyton by P. antipodarum may impact native grazers by consuming shared algal resources. In particular, because Ephemerella sp. were also effective grazers, these mayflies may compete for periphyton with P. antipodarum in the western United States. Taken together, these results suggest that ability to procure food resources may contribute to the invasion success of P. antipodarum.
