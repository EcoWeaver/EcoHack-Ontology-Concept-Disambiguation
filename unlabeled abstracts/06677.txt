The exotic palm Roystonea oleracea (Jacq.) O.F. Cook as a rural biotype for Rhodnius neglectus Lent, 1954, in Cacu, State of Goias
Introduction: Rhodnius neglectus is a triatomine that colonizes different palm species. In this study, we aimed to describe the presence of this triatomine bug in the royal palms (Roystonea oleracea) in a rural region of the State of Goias. Methods: Palm infestation was investigated by dissecting the palms or by using live-bait traps. Results: Two palm trees were infested by R. neglectus negative for Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent for Chagas disease. In the study area, R. neglectus is frequently found in households. Conclusions: The adaptation of this species to palm trees introduced in Brazil for landscaping purposes poses another challenge for controlling the vectors of Chagas disease.
