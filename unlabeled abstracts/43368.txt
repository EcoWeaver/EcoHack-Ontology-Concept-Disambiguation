Evidence for continent-wide convergent evolution and stasis throughout 150 y of a biological invasion
Significance Adaptive evolution can help species to persist and spread in new environments, but it is unclear how the rate and duration of adaptive evolution vary throughout species ranges and on the decadal timescales most relevant to managing biodiversity for the 21st century. Using herbarium records, we reconstruct 150 y of evolution in an invasive plant as it spread across North America. Flowering phenology evolves to adapt to local growing seasons throughout the range but stalls after about a century. This punctuated, convergent evolution recapitulates long-term dynamics in the fossil record, implicating limits to evolutionary rates that are not evident for the first century of spread.
