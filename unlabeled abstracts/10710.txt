Collembolan associations in natural versus improved pastures of the New England Tableland, NSW: Distribution of native and introduced species
Native Australian species of Collembola dominated natural pasture in numbers of species present and in abundance, while introduced Collembola dominated fertilized pasture sown to exotic species. Those collembolan species which were restricted to one pasture type only were mainly epigeal and hemiedaphic species of the herbage and litter. Increased grazing by sheep decreased species richness and increased uniformity of Collembola in both pasture types. The abundance of introduced Collembola was positively associated with phosphorus content of litter.
