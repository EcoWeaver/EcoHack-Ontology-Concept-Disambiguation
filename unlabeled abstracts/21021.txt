Four pathogens found associated with Eriocheir sinensis H. Milne-Edwards, 1853 (Crustacea: Brachyura: Grapsidae) from Lake Dabie (Poland)
Eriocheir sinensis is a habitat for invertebrates living externally and internally. It may transport native and non-native species to new habitats. Present studies on the Chinese mitten crab from Lake Dabie add four new taxonomic units to the number of pathogens: Ichthyophonus hoferi, Epistylis sp., Branchiobdella sp. and Digenea gen. sp., which until now have not been found in this host.
