Predatory Potential of Freshwater Animals on an Invasive Agricultural Pest, the Apple Snail Pomacea canaliculata (Gastropoda: Ampullariidae), in Southern Japan
The apple snail Pomacea canaliculata is an invasive species and a serious pest of rice in many Asian countries. We studied predatory activities of various animals living in Japanese freshwater habitats, by keeping each individual of a potential predator species with 36 snails of various sizes for three days in the aquarium. Forty-six species were tested, and 26 in eight classes fed on small snails. A species of leech, crabs, the common carp, turtles, the mallard duck and the Norway rat attacked even adult snails of 20-30 mm in shell height. These findings will be helpful in identifying effective predators for biological control of the pest snail. In addition, most of the animals attacking snails are reported to be common in rivers or ponds, but few live in modernized paddy fields having little connections with natural water systems. This may be a reason why this snail maintains large populations in paddy fields but not in other freshwater habitats.
