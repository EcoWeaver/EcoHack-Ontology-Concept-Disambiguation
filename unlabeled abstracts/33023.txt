The natural invasion of artificial cliff swallow nests by Oeciacus vicarius (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) and Ceratophyllus petrochelidoni (Siphonaptera: Ceratophyllidae)
Artificial Cliff Swallow nests were placed near a natural colony of swallows and were adopted subsequently by birds for rearing young. Observations of the swallow bug Oeciacus vicarius and the flea Ceratophyllus petrochelidoni in these and other nests, suggest that at least bugs are carried by birds to new nest sites in large numbers within a single breeding season. Adult fleas and bugs aggregated in those nests which later contained bird eggs, and flea larvae and bug eggs generally coincided with the appearance of bird eggs.
