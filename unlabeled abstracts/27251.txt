Vegetation-site relationships of roadside plant communities in West Virginia, USA
Highways are important components of modern societies in that they provide critical corridors for transporting goods and humans. They also occupy major portions of the landscape and there is growing concern about the effects of roads on local and regional ecosystems (Parendes & Jones 2000). The effect of a road on the environment is complex and includes disturbances during construction, alteration of normal hydrological flows (Forman & Alexander 1998), the introduction of chemicals, including salts (Davison 1971; Rutter & Thompson 1986) and heavy metals (Atkins et al. 1982), and fragmentation of natural habitats (Heilman et al. 2002). Vehicle exhaust emissions include solid particle emissions, oxides of carbon, sulphur and nitrogen, and gases such as ozone and ethylene (Kammerbauer et al. 1986; Ball, Jenks & Aubourg 1998), all of which may affect plant photosynthesis, composition, competition and growth (Angold 1997). Wind gusts, artificial light, noise and dust are additional effects (Spellerberg 1998). Finally, there is growing concern regarding roads as vectors for the introduction and spread of non-native and invasive species (Wilcox 1989; Westbrooks 1991; Brothers & Spingarn 1992; Parendes & Jones 2000; Gelbard & Belnap 2003). Baker (1965) summarized the ecological attributes of roadsides as (i) disturbed habitats; (ii) planted with non-native species; (iii) forming discontinuous vegetation patterns with adjacent sites; (iv) perpetually maintained in an early successional stage; (v) consisting of extensive edge habitats; (vi) having high light intensities; and (vii) used as transportation routes by humans and animals.
