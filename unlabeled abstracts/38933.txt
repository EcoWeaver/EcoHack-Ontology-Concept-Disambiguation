Habitat use and dispersal of the invasive crayfishProcambarus clarkiiin ephemeral water bodies of Portugal
We used radio-telemetry to analyze habitat use and dispersal of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii in the extreme environmental conditions of a temporary river in southern Portugal. The rationale of this study was that an understanding of the properties that make this species a successful invader can be of help for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity. The results showed that: (1) crayfish displaced at a similar rate (ranging 2.5-38 m d-1) as other European populations; (2) movement was faster at night; (3) crayfish movement had no clear environmental correlates, except for water temperature; (4) peaks of more intense locomotion were intercalated with longer periods of slow or null speed; and (5) P. clarkii did not excavate burrows in the study habitat, but took refuge under boulders and most often occupied complex microhabitats (e.g., vegetated sections of the river). The conclusion was that, notwithstanding their extreme conditions, ephemeral water bodies in southern Europe are highly susceptible to invasion by P. clarkii.
