Trinucleotide microsatellite loci for the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, an invasive species in Europe and North America
The high mutation rate at microsatellite loci can supply important demographic information on founder events and range expansion in an invasive species such as the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, following its initial introduction. In order to facilitate studies into the colonization patterns of this species in new habitats in Europe and North America, five trinucleotide microsatellite loci were isolated from a partial DNA library. Allelic diversity at all described loci was high, ranging from 20 to 35 alleles per locus. Homologous loci were not amplified in a second related invasive species, Dreisenna bugensis, using the primers developed here.
