The threat of biological invasions is under-represented in the marine protected areas of the European Natura 2000 network
To effectively tackle the challenge of biological invasions through targeted strategies and mitigation measures, managers and policy makers require adequate reporting and flow of information. For this reason, the European 'Natura 2000' network of protected areas, which is the main conservation tool of the European Union, is supported by a standardized database. All threats to biodiversity are supposed to be reported in sufficient detail through that database. We compared the reported threats by 'invasive non-native species' in the Natura 2000 database with the actual cumulative impacts of invasive alien species on marine habitats in the Mediterranean using the CIMPAL index (Cumulative IMPacts of invasive ALien species). CIMPAL estimates cumulative impact scores on the basis of the distributions of invasive species and ecosystems, and both the documented magnitude of negative ecological impacts and the strength of such evidence. We showed that the threat of invasive alien species is substantially under-reported in the official documentation. Specifically, among the 1455 marine sites of the network, no threat was officially reported in one third of the sites. The threat of biological invasions was only reported in 154 sites, despite negative impacts by invasive alien species being predicted for 98% of all sites when using CIMPAL. In fact, in the subgroup of sites where no threats have been officially reported, the impacts predicted by CIMPAL were the highest. Such, inadequate and insufficient reporting of threats in the Mediterranean marine Natura 2000 sites presents a significant obstacle to the flow of accurate information needed to support conservation policies and marine management.
