Coastal and Port Environments: International Legal and Policy Responses to Reduce Ballast Water Introductions of Potentially Invasive Species
Marine transportation moves the vast majority of cargo volume in international trade. Ballast water loaded in one port to stabilize ships for a safe voyage contains local aquatic species that are later discharged into other ports, where they are potentially invasive and can cause ecological, socioeconomic, and human health consequences. This article discusses the new Global Ballast Water Convention, what the Convention suggests about the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and its relationship to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The article also considers implementation of the Ballast Water Convention by presenting a decision support model that allows regulators to explore tradeoffs between costs and benefits of new technologies and derive optimal reductions of ballast-water-borne biological pollutants.
