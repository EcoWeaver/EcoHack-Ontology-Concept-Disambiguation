Rigid laws and invasive species management
Flexible management of exploited invasive species is needed when population control is unfeasible to avoid societal opposition and legal setbacks. Conservation conflicts arise frequently in the management of non-native invasive species (NIS) when such species provide socioeconomic benefits and have negative environmental impacts (van Wilgen & Richardson 2014). For example, when restrictions on exploitation of NIS are applied in response to demands from the public or agencies, NIS users may believe conservation interests take precedence over their interests (Fig. 1). These restrictions are justified by the benefits to biodiversity, but the absence of such benefits may generate a loss of social support for conservation, potentially leading to deregulation. To illustrate, we considered management of the red swamp crayfish in Spain and the European rabbit in New Zealand).
