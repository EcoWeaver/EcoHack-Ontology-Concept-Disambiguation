Behavioral Responses of a Small Native Fish to Multiple Introduced Predators
Rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and crayfish, Orconectes virilis, have been introduced for the last century into North American streams inhabited by native fishes. We sought to determine the behavioral response of a federally threatened cyprinid, Little Colorado spinedace, Lepidomeda vittata, in the concurrent presence of multiple nonnative predators (rainbow trout and crayfish), as well as the response to the presence of a combination of native (Apache trout, Oncorhynchus apache) and nonnative (crayfish) predators. We held spinedace in artificial streams and exposed them to four treatments: (1) control, (2) crayfish added, (3) trout added, and (4) both crayfish and trout added. Only a single spinedace was consumed over the course of the experiments; it was captured and preyed upon by a crayfish. When both crayfish and Apache trout were present, spinedace response was similar to what it was when only Apache trout were present (decreased movement in and out of refuge), suggesting that crayfish and Apache trout did not mutually influence spinedace behavior. However, when both rainbow trout and crayfish were present, spinedace not only decreased movements in and out of refuge, but also decreased activity rates. We suggest that crayfish and rainbow trout mutually influence spinedace behavior and recommend control or elimination of crayfish and rainbow trout from spinedace critical habitat or potential reintroduction sites. In addition, potential reintroduction sites for Apache trout should be evaluated based on presence of crayfish and spinedace to avoid potential multiple predator interactions and negative effects on spinedace.
