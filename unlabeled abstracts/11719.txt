A practical optimal surveillance policy for invasive weeds: An application to Hawkweed in Australia
We propose a practical analytical framework which can help government agencies determine an optimal surveillance strategy for invasive weeds, including cases of slow-growing or 'sleeper weeds', and for all weeds at early stages of invasion where quantitative information is scant or rough. The framework consists of three key components: (a) a simple rule that can determine weed surveillance zones or where early detection is desirable, (b) a function that maps surveillance effort to early detection probability, and (c) a schedule to determine an optimal surveillance budget. A calibration to Hawkweed in Australia provides an example of the framework and shows that the optimal annual surveillance budget for this sleeper weed is substantial.
