Sediment management options for the lower Ebro River and its delta
Abstract Background, Aim and Scope Past and present management of the Ebro catchment have altered water, sediment and nutrient fluxes of the lower Ebro River and its delta. The construction of the Mequinensa and Riba-Roja dams during the 1960s disrupted the sediment transport continuity.
