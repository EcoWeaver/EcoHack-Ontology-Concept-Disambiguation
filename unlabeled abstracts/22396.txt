Population dynamics and life cycle of the introduced ascidian Microcosmus squamiger in the Mediterranean Sea
Marine introductions are a serious threat for biodiversity, especially in seas where shipping is intensive. Microcosmus squamiger is a widespread marine invader that can alter native biota and it is therefore imperative to understand its biology and ecology. We studied the population dynamics and reproductive cycles of M.squamiger over a 2-year period, as well as its settlement and colonization patterns, in a north-western Mediterranean (NE Spain) locality where M.squamiger has been introduced. All biological parameters showed a strong seasonal pattern that peaked in summer with a major spawning episode at the end of summer. Size-frequency histograms indicated a 2-year cycle. Colonization experiments suggested that M.squamiger recruitment mortality is high and requires a well structured community. In addition, we monitored the abundance of the native predator Thais haemastoma, which showed a significant positive correlation with M.squamiger biomass, indicating its potential usefulness as a biological control.
