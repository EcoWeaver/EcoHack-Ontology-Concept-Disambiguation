Morphological deformities in the invasive driftwood catfish Trachelyopterus galeatus in the Upper Parana River basin, Brazil : a sign of human impact?
Here we report morphological deformities in driftwood catfish Trachelyopterus galeatus (Auchenipteridae), an invasive catfish occurring in the Upper Parana River basin, Brazil. The frequency of anomalous individuals reached 18.3% of all catches. X-ray images showed anomalies, or total absence of structures, in the pelvic girdle. Also, we observed the absence of the adipose fin and mental barbels. These findings are of extreme importance for evidencing the anthropogenic impact on aquatic communities since the region suffers within fragmentation by dams and pollution from several human activities. This sort of information can be used in management systems and environmental monitoring, especially to protect other species and the native fish assemblage. This article is protected by copyright.
