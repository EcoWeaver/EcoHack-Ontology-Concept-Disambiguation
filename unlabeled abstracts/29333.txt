Non-native and translocated fish species in Serbia and their impact on the native ichthyofauna
A total of 22 fish species have been introduced into the inland waters of Serbia, either intentionally or accidentally. This paper provides a summary of data concerning time and reason of introduction, mode of expansion, degree of acclimatization, impact on native fish and estimated area of recent distribution. Four of the non-native fish species currently occupy more than 51% of Serbian territory while 5 of them occupy between 21-50% of territory. This paper reviews impacts of introduced freshwater fish in Serbia based on collected data. KeywordsAllochthonous fish-Ecological risk-Economic benefit-Inland waters
