Germination characteristics and seedbank of the alien speciesLeucaena leucocephala(Fabaceae) in Brazilian forest: ecological implications
Plant species invasiveness is frequently associated with rapid proliferation and production of seeds that can persist in the soil for long periods of time. Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) is an alien and invasive species, for example in Brazilian forest and savannah ecosystems. This study quantified the invasive potential of this species by analysing its seed rain (using seed collectors), seed longevity in the soil (stored in buried bags) and the germination capacity of the soil seedbank (by collecting soil samples in the study area). Our results showed that seed rain occurred throughout the year, although more intensely from July to September, with about 5500 seeds m-2 year-1 being released. The numbers of seeds in the buried bags diminished over time and intact seeds showed low germinability (approximately 15%), although their viability remained >80% of the recovered seeds after two years of in situ storage. The germinability of seeds collected directly from the soil was approximately 40%, indicating that more than half of the seeds of soil seedbank were dormant (physical dormancy). Leucaena leucocephala produces large numbers of seeds and is able to form a persistent short-lived seedbank (viability 1-5 years). These factors may contribute significantly to its invasive potential, which makes it difficult to control this species once it becomes established. As control costs become higher over time, immediate public efforts are needed to counter this threat.
