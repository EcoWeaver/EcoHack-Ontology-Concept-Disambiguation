Aquatic Invasions - the new European journal of applied research on biological invasions in aquatic ecosystems
Aquatic Invasions is a new on-line journal focusing on biological invasions of the inland and coastal waters of geographic Europe. The journal will form an important tool for the rapid exchange of information pertaining to aquatic invasive species, providing an opportunity for timely publication of first records of biological invaders and hence prompting risk assessment, early warning and eradication programmes. The journal will also provide an opportunity to publish relevant technical reports and other accounts not publishable in regular scientific journals, including large datasets of aquatic invasive species records from monitoring and biological surveys.
