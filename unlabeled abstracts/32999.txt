Floral biology of Sesbania virgata: an invasive species in the Agreste of Paraiba, northeastern Brazil
Although reproduction seems to play an important role in the successful invasive strategy of Sesbania virgata, its floral biology is poorly known. We aimed at filling this gap by studying the floral biology of a population of S. virgata in the Agreste of Brazil. Sesbania virgata is a shrub that bears racemose inflorescences. Its flowers are zygomorphic, pedunculate, hermaphrodite, and have a pale yellow corolla, diadelphous androecium, anthers with longitudinal dehiscence, and inconspicuous stigma. S. virgata flowers display three different types of petals: banner (11.92 mm), wing (8.27 mm), and keel (9.3 mm). The flowering peak occurred from November to January. The average number of pollen grains per flower was 22,918, with a pollen viability of 99.93%. Its anthesis is diurnal and asynchronous. Although S. virgata is autogamous, its pollen/ovule ratio suggests that this plant has a mixed reproductive system (xenogamy + autogamy). Continuous flowering, flower morphology, and specialized breeding system are essential to assure the reproductive success of this species in the studied habitat. Sesbania virgata is a food source for flower visitors, due to its continuous flowering and large population. Therefore, it has an effective reproductive strategy that assures its invasion success.
