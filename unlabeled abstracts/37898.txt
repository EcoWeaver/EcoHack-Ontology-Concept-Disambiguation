A multidimensional framework to inform stakeholder engagement in the science and management of invasive and pest animal species
Beyond measurement of the ecological and economic impacts of invasive species and pest control on conservation, agricultural productivity and ecosystem services, there are multiple social and human dimensions which influence how stakeholders perceive and respond to research and management strategies. Given the increasing global attention on interdisciplinarity to enhance conservation research and management outcomes, we present a multidimensional framework to inform stakeholder engagement which consolidates current social sciences contributions to invasion science. Beyond unpacking the multiple drivers for considering the social dimensions of knowledge, emotions, trust and risk, we identify the ethical considerations for including social perspectives in research planning and decision-making. The framework captures the multiple personal, individual, institutional and governance dimensions of invasive species control and demonstrates how these dimensions relate. The paper concludes by discussing the implications for invasion science, policy and practice.
