Physical attractiveness, constraints to the trade and handling requirements drive the variation in species availability in the Australian cagebird trade
Understanding the traits that drive the demand for exotic pets is crucial for improving our ability to prevent the introduction of new invasive species. We investigated the factors influencing species availability within the Australian cagebird trade. We predicted that species price should be an informative indicator of the species abundance in the trade, and that physical attributes, origin of the species, and limitations for free trade and for captive breeding should be important drivers for species price. We investigated the quantitative relationship between species price and these factors using phylogenetically informed models.
