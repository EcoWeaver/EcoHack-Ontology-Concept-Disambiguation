Positive litter feedbacks of an introduced species reduce native diversity and promote invasion in Californian grasslands
Californian grasslands have a long history of invasion, starting with the introduction of exotic forage species a century ago, and followed by newer waves of invaders. Both exotic and invasive species produce large amounts of litter, but the importance of litter accumulation on the growth and expansion of these species has not been rigorously assessed. We addressed the following questions: (1) do litter type (exotic or invasive species) and litter quantity affect exotic and invasive plant performance; (2) at which plant life stages does litter accumulation effects occur; and (3) is litter accumulation impacting native species recruitment and diversity?
