Invasive species cover, soil type, and grazing interact to predict long-term grassland restoration success
Grasslands are undergoing tremendous degradation as a result of climate change, land use, and invasion by non-native plants. However, understanding of the factors responsible for driving reestablishment of grassland plant communities is largely derived from short-term studies. In order to develop an understanding of the factors responsible for longer term restoration outcomes in California annual grasslands, we surveyed 12 fields in Davis, CA, U.S.A., in 2015 that were seeded with native species mixtures starting in 2004. Using field surveys, we investigated how invasive plant richness and cover, native plant richness and cover, aboveground biomass, grazing, soil type, and restoration species identity might provide utility for explaining patterns of restoration success. We found a negative relationship between invasive cover and restoration cover, which was attributed to the slow establishment of seeded species and subsequent dominance by weeds. The relationship between invasive cover and restoration cover was modified by grazing, likely due to a change in the dominance of exotic forbs, which have a more similar growing season to restoration species, and therefore compete more strongly for late season moisture. Finally, we found that soil type was responsible for differences in the identity and abundance of invasive plants, subsequently affecting restoration cover. This work highlights the value of focusing resources on reducing invasive species cover, limiting grazing to periods of adequate moisture, and considering soil type for successful long-term restoration in California annual grasslands. Moreover, observations of long-term restoration outcomes can provide insight into the way mechanisms driving restoration outcomes might differ through time.
