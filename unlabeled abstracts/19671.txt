Display Behavior and Habitat Use in Single and Mixed Populations of Anolis carolinensis and Anolis sagrei Lizards
Introduced species can have a variety of effects on the behavior and ecology of native species. We compared display behavior and habitat use of introduced Anolis sagrei and native Anolis carolinensis lizards across three sites in Southern Louisiana. The chosen sites were similar in that they were all located in urban settings with clumped vegetation. The first site contained only A. sagrei, the second supported sympatric A. sagrei and A. carolinensis populations, and the third site harbored only A. carolinensis. We found that (1) A. carolinensis perched significantly higher when A. sagrei was present, consistent with previous studies, whereas perch height of A. sagrei was not altered by the presence of A. carolinensis; (2) A. carolinensis in single and mixed sites exhibited different proportions of display types, with individuals at the mixed Tulane site performing significantly more C displays than those at the single site; and (3) Anolis sagrei at the Tulane mixed site exhibited less push-ups than those in the site with A. sagrei alone. These data suggest that the arrival of congeners can affect display behavior of anoles, although such effects are different for the natives and the invaders.
