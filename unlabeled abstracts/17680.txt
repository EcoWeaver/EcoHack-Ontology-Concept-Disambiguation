Ecophysiological performance of Calotropis procera: an exotic and evergreen species in Caatinga, Brazilian semi-arid
To better understand the proliferation of Calotropis procera in a semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil (Caatinga), we designed two experiments to deter-mine which ecophysiological characteristics contribute to the species adaptive success. The first experiment was conducted with young plants under greenhouse conditions and three water regimes. The second experiment was conducted with adult plants under field conditions subject to regional seasonality. Young plants exhibited a high tolerance to water deficits, mainly because of their strong stomatal control, which was observed before any bio-chemical alterations in leaf metabolism. Only under full suspension of irrigation did the plants show a reduction in relative water content. Under field conditions, adult plants showed a high resilience to the semi-arid environment with respect to gas exchange and other measured biochemical parameters, including photosynthetic pigment, soluble sugars, amino acids and protein content, even under the low soil water availability of the dry season. This season featured high photosynthetically active radiation, low rel-ative humidity and high temperatures, and thus exposed plants to extreme differences between leaf and air tem-peratures. Calotropis procera remains green throughout the year, indicating that it has developed several means of tolerating the semi-arid climate. Furthermore, this species maintains a high photosynthetic rate despite reduced sto-matal conductance, which increases its water use effi-ciency, a fundamental characteristic for survival in this ecosystem.
