Bioenergy that supports ecological restoration
Bioenergy development can offer beneficial ecological and economic synergies through the expansion of ecological restoration projects. Such synergies are demonstrated by means of a case study conducted in central Washington State, where a 52.4-ha ecological restoration site on the Yakama Reservation generated 34 mega-grams (Mg) of invasive tree biomass per hectare, costing $988 ha(-1). A geospatial model of transportation costs estimated that extracted invasive tree biomass can generate revenues throughout 1103 803 ha when delivered to a proposed bioenergy facility in White Swan, Washington, providing 53 000-180 000 Mg of biomass per year for several decades. Thermochemical analyses revealed that the elevated nitrogen, sulfur, and ash content in two prolific invasive trees - Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) and salt cedar (Tamarix spp) - will limit demand for either of these invasive species. We compare our regional data to national estimates, and show the broader potential for expanding ecological restoration activities and biomass supplies through the revenues generated by the sale of invasive tree wood-waste into bioenergy markets.
