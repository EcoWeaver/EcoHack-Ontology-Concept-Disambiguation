First report of the citrus leafhopper Penthimiola bella (Stal) (Hemiptera, Cicadellidae) in Europe
The presence of the citrus leafhopper, Penthimiola bella (Stal) (Hemiptera, Cicadellidae), was detected in citrus orchards in Portugal. This is the first report of this cicadellid in Europe. A survey was carried out in 30 citrus orchards in Algarve, in southern Portugal, based on both the beating method and visual observation of shoots, between July and December 2012. P. bella was detected in a total of 19 orchards distributed throughout the region. The occurrence of reproducing populations of P. bella and its dispersion over a relatively large area of at least 70 km in length within Algarve suggests that this species established and has been expanding its distribution in the region for several years since its arrival. The possible pathway of introduction and its pest status are discussed.
