Erixestus zygogrammae Cave and Grissell (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae): An exotic egg parasitoid of Zygogramma bicolorata Pallister (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in Australia
The solitary endoparasitoid Erixestus zygogrammae has been identified from eggs of the parthenium weed biocontrol agent Zygogramma bicolorata Pallister laid on ragweed in Brisbane. It has been recorded recently as an egg parasitoid of Z. magica Stal in Honduras, Central America. Possible sources of introduction of this parasitoid into Australia are discussed.
