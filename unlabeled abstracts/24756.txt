Alien arthropod predators and parasitoids: interactions with the environment
Many species of entomophagous arthropods have been introduced either intentionally (through the practice of biological control) or unintentionally to new regions. We examine interactions of these aliens with their new environments in the context of rapid global change linked to human activity. We consider effects of such interactions on establishment and spread of the alien species and effects on indigenous biota and ecosystems. Major elements of global change that affect alien-environment interactions include landscape modifications by humans (e.g., cultivation, habitat loss and fragmentation) and increases in atmospheric CO2 and other gases resulting in climate change and other effects (e.g., changes in food quality for herbivores that affect higher trophic levels as well). Alien arthropod predators can alter landscapes for their benefit, to the detriment of indigenous species. A brief review also of blood-feeding alien arthropods makes clear that interactions with the environment critically influence invasions of zoophagous arthropods in general.
