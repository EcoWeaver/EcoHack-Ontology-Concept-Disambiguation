Release and distribution ofLilioceris cheni(Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), a biological control agent of air potato (Dioscorea bulbifera: Dioscoreaceae), in Florida
From 2012 to 2015, 429,668 Lilioceris cheni Gressit and Kimoto (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) were released in Florida for biological control of air potato [Dioscorea bulbifera L. (Dioscoreaceae)], an important environmental weed. The spatial distribution of releases was highly aggregated, with several areas of high density releases and other regions with few releases. In the fall of 2015, a statewide survey was conducted at 113 randomly selected air potato infestations in order to determine the spatial distribution of L. cheni. Adult beetles were found at 75% of locations searched, and damage due to L. cheni was found at 86% of locations. Highest levels of damage were encountered in a wide longitudinal band through peninsular Florida from the Fort Myers area in the southwest to Jacksonville in the northeast. Beetle damage was low in the Florida panhandle where air potato was relatively uncommon and fewer beetles had been released, and in far south Florida, despite high numbers of beetle releases. On average, beetles traveled 9.5 km from the nearest release site to survey sites from the date of release to the time of the survey, with a maximum distance of nearly 67 km. The rate of spread was estimated at 8.2 km/year under the assumption that beetles present at survey sites migrated or were moved from the nearest release site. Air potato vines produced fewer aerial tubers, the vegetative propagule of air potato, as foliar damage due to L. cheni increased. The results suggest that future research efforts should focus on determining the biotic and abiotic factors that may be limiting establishment in some areas of Florida.
