AILANTHUS ALTISSIMA (MILLER) SWINGLE - INVASIVE SPECIES IN THE FOREST HABITATS IN THE UPPER BASIN OF THE MOTRU RIVER
Ailanthus altissima (Miller) Swingle is an invasive species found in forest habitats in Oltenia and beyond. The aggression and power of dissemination and development of this species is increasing. The thematic area provided in this paper is situated in the upper basin of the Motru river. Within this study had been aimed the identification and level of pressures and threats of the invasive species Ailanthus altissima in the forest habitats in the researched territory. These studies also noted the conservation status of the forest habitats in which this invasive species was encountered. In this area we identified this invasive species in the following forest habitats: 91E0* Alluvial forests with Alnus glutinosa and Fraxinus excelsior (Alno-Padion, Alnion incanae, Salicion albae), 91V0 Dacian Beech forests (SymphytoFagion), 9130 Asperulo-Fagetum beech forests, 91M0 Pannonian-Balkanic turkey oak - sessile oak forests. This species influence the succesional dynamics and the floristic composition of the forest habitats, occupying increasingly more and more space.
