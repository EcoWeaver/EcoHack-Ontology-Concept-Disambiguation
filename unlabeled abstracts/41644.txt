Tapinoma melanocephalum (Fabricius), a new exotic pest in Korea
Tapinoma melanocephalum (Fabricius) is established as a house pest in various regions of the world, not limited to its original climate zones. T. melanocephalum seems likely to become established in Korea as well, based on our observations of the species from a private house in Seoul, Korea, its history of establishment in the world, and a few unofficial records in Korea. Diagnosis of the species is provided with pictures of specimens. Morphological characteristics identifying T. melanocephalum from the Korean indigenous Tapinoma species are provided.
