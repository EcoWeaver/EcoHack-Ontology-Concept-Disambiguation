Limited mitochondrial DNA diversity is indicative of a small number of founders of the German raccoon (Procyon lotor) population
The raccoon (Procyon lotor) has successfully invaded central Europe, despite the population apparently having been founded by a small number of individuals in two distinct populations in Germany. The ecological success of the invasion has been explained by raccoons being an adaptable, truly omnivorous species. However, the German raccoon population might have a larger number of founders and be more genetically diverse than assumed, as accidental or deliberate releases of household pets or individuals from zoos are relatively common. In the present study, we sequenced a 550-base-pair long fragment of the mitochondrial control region in 193 raccoons from Germany and neighbouring countries. We only identified six different haplotypes; of which, five were limited to Germany. Our results support the notions that the population was founded by a small number of females and that the German raccoons originate from two separate release events in central and eastern Germany. Additionally, however, we provide evidence for the presence of a distinct population in Saxony, eastern Germany. Further studies using different genetic markers are necessary to gain additional information on genetic diversity and population genetic structure.
