Biology of milk thistle (Silybum marianum) and the management options for growers in north-western Pakistan
Milk thistle (Silybum marianum) is cultivated as a medicinal plant but it also can be a troublesome weed. It is an annual or biennial herb that prefers high rainfall and fertile soils. Milk thistle has become a widespread weed in north-western Pakistan, where it causes yield reductions <=37% in wheat and poses harvesting problems due to its thorny nature. Shortcomings in cultural practises, such as a low crop seed rate, wide row spacing, broadcast fertilizer, and limited crop rotation have contributed to milk thistle becoming a severe weed problem for farmers in this region. This paper reviews the biology of milk thistle and discusses the possible management options for its control, considering the socioeconomic conditions of farmers in Pakistan.
