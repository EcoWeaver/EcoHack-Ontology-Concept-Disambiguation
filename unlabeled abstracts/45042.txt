The native avian species visiting fruiting invasive Lantana camara in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Potential dispersal concerns
Alien invasive plant species are a major problem globally, threatening ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. Native bird species facilitate their spread through mutualistic relationships. Studies of seed dispersal of alien invasive plants are important for effective management. In the present study, we investigated the role of native bird species in the potential dispersal of the highly invasive shrub Lantana camara in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We observed a total of 56 native bird species visiting fruiting L. camara with only 28 (50 %) species consuming the fruit. Visitation frequencies were significantly higher for small and medium-sized frugivorous species. The dark-capped bulbul Pycnonotus tricolor was the frugivorous bird species most observed visiting and is likely the main potential native avian disperser of L. camara. Interestingly, two non-frugivorous birds, the white-bellied sunbird Cinnyris talatala and the white-browed scrub-robin Cercotrichas leucophrys showed relatively high visitation frequencies to L. camara. Our study showed that L. camara benefits from seed dispersers and pollinators for seed reproduction and spread. These results emphasise the importance of evaluating the role of native bird species in the dispersal of alien invasive species.
