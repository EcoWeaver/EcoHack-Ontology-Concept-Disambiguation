The evolution of targeted cannibalism and cannibal-induced defenses in invasive populations of cane toads
Significance Invasive species are known for their ability to achieve high densities within their introduced range. Hence, invaders often face strong competition from members of their own species. Mechanisms for reducing intraspecific competition may therefore be favored in invasive populations, such as cannibalism, in which individuals kill and eat intraspecific competitors. Here, we find that toad tadpoles from invasive Australian populations have evolved both a strong behavioral attraction to the vulnerable hatchling stage and an increased propensity to cannibalize these younger conspecifics. In response, these toads have also evolved multiple strategies for reducing the duration of the vulnerable period, indicating an evolutionary arms race between the cannibalistic tadpole stage and the vulnerable egg and hatchling stages in invaded habitats.
