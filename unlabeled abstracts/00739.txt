Range shifts of Potentilla fruticosa on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau during glacial and interglacial periods revealed by chloroplast DNA sequence variation
The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is one of the most extensive habitats for alpine plants in the world. Therefore, the patterns of genetic variation in populations on the Plateau can reveal the detailed demographic history of alpine plants. We analysed the geographical structure of chloroplast matK sequence variation in Potentilla fruticosa L. (Rosaceae), a shrub currently found across the entire Plateau. We obtained sequence data from 508 individuals from 23 populations at sites ranging from the high-altitude interior to the relatively low-altitude northeastern Plateau. In the interior region, genetic diversity was high and included ancestral haplotypes. In contrast, northeastern populations were characterized by relatively low genetic diversity and recently derived haplotypes. The estimated expansion time in the interior population was 17 times that in the northeastern population. These data suggest that P. fruticosa expanded its range on the Plateau during periods of climatic cooling and contracted to the interior region during warmer periods. Thus, the interior region acted as a refugium and greatly contributed to the diversification of P. fruticosa.
