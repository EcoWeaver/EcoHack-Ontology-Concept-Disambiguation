Species Identity and Water Availability Determine Establishment Success Under the Canopy ofRetama sphaerocarpaShrubs in a Dry Environment
Seedling establishment in harsh environments is often enhanced by the proximity of adult shrubs. This information has been used in restoration work by placing seedlings of species being restored under the canopy of some shrubs. However, monitoring this process is often restricted to a single species, and comparisons with practices that protect planted seedlings against harsh conditions are scant. Similarly, few studies have supplied seedlings with water in the summer to observe the effects of water availability on the interaction. We compared sapling survival of three woody species (Olea europaea, Pistacia lentiscus, and Ziziphus lotus) under the leguminous shrub Retama sphaerocarpa and in gaps covered with piled branches that mimicked a shrub canopy. After 3 years, survival of saplings planted under Retama differed depending on species identity and water supply. Survival of Olea saplings placed under Retama shrubs was twice that under piled branches if not watered (35 +- 8 vs. 17 +- 2 %, respectively), whereas survival of saplings under Retama, if watered, was less (48 +- 11 vs. 68 +- 8%, respectively). Retama shrubs had a negative effect on Ziziphus; most saplings died under its canopy, whereas survival in piled branches ranged 10-54%. Pistacia was neither facilitated nor outcompeted by Retama. Facilitation of Olea by Retama shrubs was more apparent under dry conditions where watering increased competition and decreased facilitation. Overall, we conclude that Retama shrubs can help dry land restoration to a greater extent than artificial shade for Olea when not watered. The critical role played by water supply in determining nursing success rates warrants further study.
