Distributions and Climatic Correlations of Some Exotic Species Along Roadsides in South Island, New Zealand
All 24 studied exotic species along roadsides were correlated to some degree with climatic factors, though for several species alternative environmental factors have almost as good a fit. Four species occurred in the colder/wetter areas (eg Cirsium palustre); most were more frequent in the warmer/drier areas (eg Lactuca serriola). Some species were confined to small areas with high summer temperatures, sunshine, and water deficit (eg Onopordum acanthium). Several pairs/trios of species correlated best with the same factors (eg Marrubium vulgare and Navarettia squarrosa with water deficit). For four species distributions may reflect dispersal limitations. Comparisons with the distributions of the species in their native ranges gave close agreement in climatic limits for some species (eg Echium vulgare, O. acanthium, Senecio jacobaea), but considerable differences for others (eg Verbascum virgatum). -from Authors
