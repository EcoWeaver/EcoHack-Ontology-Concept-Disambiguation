Invasive<i>Acacia auriculiformis</i>Benth. in different habitats in Unguja, Zanzibar
Acacia auriculiformis Benth., Mimosaceae, has been introduced relatively recently as a plantation tree to the island of Unguja, Zanzibar. It has been reported to establish itself outside the plantations, but it is not known if the success of establishment depends on habitat quality. We investigated the occurrence of A. auriculiformis in 5-m-wide sample lines, which started from the edge of acacia plantations and reached farthermost the distance of 1 km. The results of 7.24 ha studied showed that: (1) A. auriculiformis occurred in most of the studied habitats in Unguja and appeared to be more abundant in deep soils than in shallow coral-derived soils. However, statistical analyses suggested that the species has little preference or avoidance towards any of the habitats, even though forests - the least disturbed habitats - seemed to have less acacias than other more disturbed habitats. (2) The number of acacias decreased rapidly with the distance from an acacia plantation, and most of the found acacias were still young, below three metres tall. Our results suggest that the invasion of A. auriculiformis is at its beginning in Unguja. If no preventive measures are taken, A. auriculiformis may have an increasing impact on local ecosystem in the future.
