Recent releases and dispersal of non-native fishes in England and Wales, with emphasis on sunbleak Leucaspius delineatus (Heckel, 1843)
The introduced range of the European cyprinid, sunbleak Leucaspius delineatus, in England was previously limited to parts of southwest England but has now expanded across Southern England. Natural dispersal mechanisms cannot explain their increased distribution and fish stocking was not a factor. Thus, the accidental movement of either their eggs or larvae via anglers' nets was believed to be the mechanism by which these fish were accidentally moved between waters over 100 km apart. This dispersal pathway is difficult to regulate, as is the release of unwanted non-native aquarium and pond fish into open waters by the public. This latter pathway has resulted in the recent releases of species including walking catfish Clarias batrachus, Asian weatherfish Misgurnus mizolepis and white catfish Ameiurus catus.
