The invasive species Perna viridis (Linnaeus, 1758 - Bivalvia: Mytilidae) on artificial substrates: A baseline assessment for the Colombian Caribbean Sea
This baseline paper shows the Indo-Pacific mussel Perna viridis (Asian green mussel) inhabiting on floating plastic substrates in the Atlantico Department, as well as rafting on marine debris found at the Via Parque Isla de Salamanca (Magdalena). Both observations are the northernmost record of the species found in the Colombian Caribbean Sea. The above finding opens a new door that suggests that larval dispersion alone may not be the only process responsible for the presence of this invasive suspension-feeder bivalve because this species needs specific vectors for its dispersal. Some organisms such Perna viridis can persist in the marine environment, but they do not necessarily have a rafting capability that allows them to move over long distances. Floating structures as well as marine debris can serve as optimal substrates in the marine environment, contributing to an increase in the problems of non-native species on sites with a high degree of susceptibility to species invasion.
