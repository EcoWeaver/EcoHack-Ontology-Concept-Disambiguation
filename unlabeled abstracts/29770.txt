Genome Sequence of a Lethal Vascular Wilt Fungus, Verticillium nonalfalfae, a Biological Control Used Against the Invasive Ailanthus altissima
Verticillium nonalfalfae , a cosmopolitan soil-borne phytopathogen, causes vascular wilt in agricultural crops and perennial woody plants. Select strains of V. nonalfalfae can cause lethal disease in the invasive tree Ailanthus altissima and several have since been utilized as a biological control (biocontrol) against this widespread invader.
