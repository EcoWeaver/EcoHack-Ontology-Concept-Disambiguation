Spread Rates under Temporal Variability: Calculation and Application to Biological Invasions
In this paper, we introduce a technique to study the minimal wave speed in reaction-diffusion equations with temporal variability and apply it to two particular models for biological invasions. We use the exponential transform to avoid solving partial differential equations explicitly or finding inverse transforms. In a single reaction-diffusion equation with time-periodic coefficients, the minimal wave speed depends only on time-averages of each coefficient function. In a two-compartment system with mobile and stationary individuals, the invasion speed depends on the precise form of the coefficient functions and their temporal correlations; in some cases, a lower bound can be obtained. Our technique can be extended to more complex life histories of invading organisms.
