Host species of the non-indigenous brittle star Ophiothela mirabilis (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea): an invasive generalist in Brazil?
Background: The brittle star Ophiothela mirabilis has recently invaded and is expanding its range in the southwest Atlantic. Results: Here we report a total of 29 novel host taxons/functional group (ten sponges, six cnidarians, five ascidians, four echinoderms, two algae, one bryozoan and a seahorse) used by O. mirabilis at different sites at Ilha Grande Bay, Brazil. Conclusions: The large number of species colonized by the ophiuroids suggests that they have become opportunistic and generalist in relation to their host species. The yellow-orange Brazilian lineage did not use camouflage reported in other studies, as they were highly visible and contrasted in color to many host species which suggests that they may possess some kind of predator deterrence. The high abundances of O. mirabilis registered here also suggest potential impacts to their hosts which need further study.
