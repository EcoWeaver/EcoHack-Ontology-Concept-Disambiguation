Atlantic coral reefs: the transplantation alternative
Although all of the world's coral reef regions have suffered degradation due to direct and indirect human influences, only the Western Atlantic reefs have declined to the extent that their continued existence appears to be in jeopardy. Of a once flourishing reef system, only about 10% is still alive and it is depauperate in terms of the food web diversity necessary to maintain a stable and productive ecosystem. The large carnivores and herbivores have become so scarce that they have failed to control the populations of smaller animals and plants, so that almost all the trophic levels have been disrupted. At the same time, the impacts of many other factors have contributed to the process of degradation resulting in a true crisis. The extent of damage, and the general impairment of regeneration, is such that a hope for natural recovery appears to be unrealistic. It is suggested that a recovery could be achieved through transplantation of corals and other reef species from areas where more diverse, relatively stable ecosystems still exist. Available data on the introduction of exotic species into marine ecosystems indicate that such species are generally accommodated and do not cause extinctions among the native species. Although some introduced species are considered to be pests, others have proved to be beneficial, and all have apparently increased the biodiversity of the invaded areas.
