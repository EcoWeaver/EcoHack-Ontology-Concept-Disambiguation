Long-term dynamics and impacts of plant invasions
Hundreds of studies have evaluated the dynamics of plant invasions and their impacts on native plant communities and ecosystem functions, but most are limited in duration to only one or a few years. As such, we have a poor understanding of how invader dynamics and impacts change over time. This special feature presents six studies that use literature reviews, field studies and experiments to examine long-term patterns in invader effects on species, communities and ecosystems. All studies in the special feature focus on data collected over multiple years and two studies provide data that cover multiple decades. One study provides a review and framework for understanding how invaders impact plant-mycorrhiza mutualisms and two studies focus on long-term ecosystem changes in response to invasion and fire. The next two studies examine how invaders respond to successional change and climate conditions over time, and the final study shows that invaders can shift selection regimes and the evolutionary trajectory of native plant populations. Synthesis. Articles in this special feature demonstrate changes in the dynamics of invasive plant populations and their community and ecosystem impacts over time. Together they illustrate that findings from a snapshot in time may poorly describe years-long outcomes of invasions, and they highlight the need for long-term studies of biological invasions.
