Age structure of non-native fish species, Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus, 1758) from the tributary of the Ganga river, India
Cyprinus carpio (e.g. culture and wild/capture) constitute a large part of daily meal of human population in Indian sub-continent. It shows benthic and sedentary behavior. Age structure of C. carpio was studied during February 2019 to January 2020 from fish landing centre at Sirsa, Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India. The key scales were studied for estimation of age structure in the present study. A total of 548 fish specimens in length ranges between 97 to 687 mm and age classes of 0+ to 9+ were observed. Age structures were determined for male, female and pooled samples separately. The 1+ age group was most dominating stock with shared 23.53%, 24.64% and 24.09% in case of male, female and pooled samples, respectively. The age group 2+ was second dominating age class and this age class more attracted to fishermen for the exploitation. In case of pooled sample, 1+ age group was also dominated compared to 2+ and 3+ age groups. The old age groups of fishes were shared very minute proportion in the total stock. Present study was also indicated that the female fishes live longer than male from the Tons river at Prayagraj, India.
