Biological Invasions in the Amazonian Tropical Rain Forest: The Case of Drosophilidae (Insecta, Diptera) in Ecuador, South America
There have been few reports of invasions in continental rain forests, especially for exotic animals. This study provides original data concerning the potential of exotic drosophilid species to colonize the Amazonian tropical rain forest. To investigate if the structure of drosophilid assemblages differed in response to anthropogenic disturbance, we performed a taxonomic survey at six sites within the Yasuni National Park in Ecuadorian Amazonia along a disturbance gradient from pristine to clearcut artificial forest. A total of 7425 individuals from 34 species were collected of which seven species were exotic. There was significant variation in the assemblage composition along this disturbance gradient; 31 percent of which was explained by the presence of exotic species, particularly at the most disturbed sites, through nonmetric multidimensional scaling and SIMPER analyses. These results confirm the susceptibility of continental rain forests to invasion by exotic species. There is an urgent need to develop and implement monitoring systems, for example, based on drosophilid assemblage surveys, to detect exotic invasions in continental tropical forests.
