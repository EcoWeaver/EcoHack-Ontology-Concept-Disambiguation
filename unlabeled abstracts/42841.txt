Invasive species in an international context: IPPC, CBD, European Strategy on Invasive Alien Species and other legal instruments
The paper outlines the multiple impacts of invasive alien species and explains the rationale for coordinated international action to minimize their environmental as well as economic effects. It describes the different components and current state of development of the international regulatory framework relevant to invasive alien species, with reference to plant pests and animal disease, biodiversity conservation and maritime and aviation transport. The paper summarises recent developments at the Euro-Mediterranean level with particular attention to the European Strategy on Invasive Alien Species adopted under the Bern Convention. It concludes by identifying some gaps and inconsistencies at global, regional and national levels, together with indicators for possible ways forward.
