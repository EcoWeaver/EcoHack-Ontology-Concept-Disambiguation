Additional records of non-native freshwater fishes for the Ebro River basin (Spain)
This paper extends the knowledge of the geographical distribution of non-native freshwater fishes in the Ebro River basin (Spain). More than two hundred surveys were carried out since 2000, and thirteen non-native fish species were collected on fifty-eight occasions. The spread of most of the recorded non-native species seems to be a consequence of illegal introductions related to sport fishing activities and the subsequent natural dispersal. Their presence could impact natural populations of Iberian native -mostly endemic- freshwater fish species, through direct predation and competition for niche and/or trophic resources.
