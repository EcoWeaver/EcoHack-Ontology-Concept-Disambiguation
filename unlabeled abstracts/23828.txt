Using ecological niche modeling to assess biogeographic and niche response of brachiopod species to the Richmondian Invasion (Late Ordovician) in the Cincinnati Arch
Within the Cincinnati, Ohio region, the beginning stage of a large-scale biotic invasion is recorded in the C4 depositional sequence (Late Ordovician, Richmondian Stage), which includes the Arnheim Formation and its correlates. The fauna and strata of this region are well studied and the ecological changes present provide a unique opportunity to study biogeographic changes associated with the onset of a biotic invasion. In this study, GIS-based ecological niche modeling (ENM) is used to examine the biogeographic and paleoecological impacts of the biotic invasion during the C4 sequence. In particular, this study assesses whether species respond to invasion pressure through niche conservatism (exhibiting stasis and maintaining the parameters of their ecological niche through time) or niche evolution (altering the ecological parameters of their niche through adaptation).
