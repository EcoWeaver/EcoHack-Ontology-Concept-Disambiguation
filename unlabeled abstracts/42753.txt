Responses of soil biota and nitrogen availability to an invasive plant under aboveground herbivory
Aims Recently, much attention has been paid to the plant-mediated effects of aboveground herbivory on soil ecosystems. However, studies about the herbivore-induced effects of invasive plants on soil ecosystem are still lacking. In this study, we aimed to examine the soil biota and nutrient availability to an invasive plant under aboveground herbivory stress, and compare the soil responses with a native plant. Methods We subjected an invasive plant (Spartina alterniflora) and a native plant (Phragmites australis) to herbivory by caterpillars of native moth Laelia coenosa, and measured soil microbes, nematodes, inorganic nitrogen (N), plant biomass and N content. Results Soil microbial biomass, nematode abundance, ammonium N concentrations and N mineralization rates were significantly stimulated by herbivory of the invasive S. alterniflora. Besides, the stimulation of bacteria: fungi ratio, abundance of bacterivorous nematodes, and ammonium N availability were significantly higher for S. alterniflora than for P. australis. Conclusions In general, aboveground insect herbivory of the invasive S. alterniflora enhanced the abundance of soil biota, and the soil N availability. The greater soil responses associated with S. alterniflora suggest stronger positive soil feedback than those with the native P. australis, which might facilitate the invasive plant to successfully invade its new range under biotic stress.
