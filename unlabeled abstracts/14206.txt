Survival and Horizontal Movement of the Freshwater Mussel Potamilus capax (Green, 1832) Following Relocation within a Mississippi Delta Stream System
Relocation of federally protected freshwater mussel (Unionidae) resources as a conservation strategy has occurred for more than 30 y to ameliorate site-specific threats associated with development activities or invasive species. In this study, we evaluated survival rates of resident and relocated Potamilus capax (Green, 1832) individuals and documented short-term (1 mo) and long-term (25 mo) horizontal movements. We observed P. capax survival rates >77% for all treatment groups and horizontal movement up to 120 m annually. While significant differences in movement behavior between treatment groups occurred during the early stages of the study, movement differences between resident and relocated treatment groups became nonsignificant as the study progressed. We concluded using survival as a success measure remains valuable, but requires further evaluation. However, we assert understanding movement behavior in the focus species remains critical to strategic development of monitoring strategies.
