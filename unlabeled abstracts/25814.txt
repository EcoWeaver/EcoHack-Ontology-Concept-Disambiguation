Invasive species threats to native aquatic insect biodiversity and conservation measures in Hawai'i and French Polynesia
Impacts of invasive species, and of attempts to control them, on the aquatic invertebrate fauna of Hawaii and French Polynesia are reviewed and discussed, as a foundation for determining conservation need. Aquatic insects are poorly documented in the region, with many species undescribed, so that practical conservation must be pursued with highly incomplete basic taxonomic knowledge. The establishment of at least one dedicated reserve for aquatic invertebrates is recommended for each high island in an archipelago, as an aid to safeguarding local endemic species, and other recommendations include increased monitoring for new alien species (particularly of fish), planning for removal of alien species from selected water bodies where alien species are less likely to recolonize, effective protection of key sites with high biodiversity value, and securing sites for future restoration and translocation or rare and endangered species.
