Restoring ecological function in temperate grassy woodlands: manipulating soil nutrients, exotic annuals and native perennial grasses through carbon supplements and spring burns
It is notable that Themeda reduced soil nitrate at Windermere even though other native perennial grasses already dominated these plots. This could reflect the small overall increase in native perennials on these plots by autumn 2004 (Fig. 4), or Themeda may have a greater effect than other native grasses on soil nitrate. The latter is supported by evidence for consistently lower nitrate levels beneath Themeda swards than beneath other native grass swards (Prober, Thiele & Lunt 2002) and evidence that perennial grass species can differ greatly in their effects on soil nitrate (Tilman & Wedin 1990). Studies comparing effects of relevant native perennial grasses on soil nutrients are thus needed to guide selection of species for restoring ecosystem function in temperate Australian woodland. Of particular interest is the influence of Poa, once codominant with Themeda in woodland understoreys; this cool-season C3 perennial may influence soil nitrogen during winter and early spring, when Themeda is dormant and exotic annuals are active. The contribution of subsidiary forbs and grasses to this process also requires assessment.
