Plant community and the influence of plant taxonomic diversity on community stability and invasibility: A case study based on Solidago canadensis L.
Invasive alien plants (IAPs) can negatively affect plant taxonomic diversity, community stability, and invasibility in the invaded habitats. This study aimed to assess the degree of influence of the IAP Solidago canadensis L. under various levels of invasion (i.e., light, moderate, and heavy invasion based on its relative abundance in the invaded communities) on plant taxonomic diversity, community stability, and invasibility. In addition, we determined the contribution of plant taxonomic diversity to community stability and invasibility under various levels of S. canadensis invasion. The degree of influence of S. canadensis on plant taxonomic diversity and community stability increases as the level of S. canadensis invasion increases. Community invasibility increases as the level of S. canadensis invasion increases. The competitive advantage of S. canadensis is negatively associated with all indexes of plant taxonomic diversity and community stability but positively connected with community invasibility. Community stability is positively related to Shannon's diversity and Simpson's dominance indexes but negatively associated with community invasibility. Inversely, communities were more likely to be invaded when they had less plant taxonomic diversity. Thus, plant communities with lower values of plant taxonomic diversity and community stability are more vulnerable to S. canadensis invasion. Plant diversity causes a greater pressure on community stability than the other indexes of plant taxonomic diversity under various levels of S. canadensis invasion. However, the contribution intensity of the number of plant species to community invasibility is higher than the other indexes of plant taxonomic diversity under various levels of S. canadensis invasion.
