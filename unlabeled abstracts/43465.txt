First records of Viviparus acerosus (Bourguignat, 1862) (Gastropoda: Viviparidae) from the Czech Republic outside its native range
Three native species of the Viviparidae are known in the Czech Republic, namely Viviparus acerosus, V. contectus and V. viviparus. The native range of V. acerosus includes the Danube and probably Dnieper and Dvina river basins. In the Czech Republic it inhabits slowly flowing rivers and canals in the floodplain of the Dyje and Morava rivers in South Moravia (Danube River basin). Recently, this species was found outside its native range in four sites in Bohemia (Labe River basin) and in one site in Silesia (Odra River basin). The species identity of the abundant population from the Svihov dam reservoir (Labe River basin) was verified using COI sequences. These finds represent the first records of the species in the Labe and Odra river basins. The possible origin of these populations is discussed.
