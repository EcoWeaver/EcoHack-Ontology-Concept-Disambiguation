Functional traits, growth patterns, and litter dynamics of invasive alien and co-occurring native shrub species of chir pine forest in the central Himalaya, India
Across the continents, plant invasion is identified as one of the main threats to ecosystem functioning and stability. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the differences in the functional traits between invasive alien (Ageratina adenophora (Spreng.) and Lantana camara L.) and native (Berberis asiatica Roxb. Ex DC., Pyracantha crenulata (D. Don.) M. Roemer and Rubus ellipticus Sm.) shrub species of chir pine (Pinus roxburghii Sarg.) forest in the central Himalaya. Three 0.5 hectare chir pine forest stands were selected and individuals of similar diameter were tagged for comparative studies of leaf traits, growth pattern, and biomass accumulation in structural organs of each invasive alien and native species. Our one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test results showed that both the invasive alien species have significantly (p < 0.05) higher SLA, LWC, total chlorophyll content, foliar nutrient (N and P), RGR, LMR, SMR, nutrient uptake, and nutrient use efficiencies than native species. Leaf litter decomposition rate and nutrient release were also significantly (p < 0.05) higher in both the invasive alien species. Native species, R. ellipticus, shared some of the traits, such as leaf area, chlorophyll content, RGR, LAR, LMR, and nutrient uptake efficiency with invasive alien species. The majority of traits differed among invasive alien and native species, implying that the success of invasive alien species is best described by being functionally distinct from native species. These findings indicate that invasive alien species had advanced functional traits which may be playing an important role in a rapid spread in the central Himalaya.
