Plant species loss and community nestedness after leguminous tree Acacia pycnantha invasion in a Mediterranean ecosystem
Invasions of ecosystems by alien species are one of the major threats to biodiversity. Among alien plant species, members of the family Fabaceae s.l. represent some of the most dangerous and well known global invaders. In Mediterranean ecosystems, many Australian acacias have been found to establish and rapidly spread, often determining severe impacts on understorey vegetation. In the present work, we report the case study of Acacia pycnantha invasion in a typical Mediterranean matorral (Elba Island, central Mediterranean Sea, Italy). We conducted a survey of understorey plant communities across an invasion gradient from non-invaded to transitional and invaded areas, aiming to quantify the impacts on the understorey assemblage and to investigate the ecological processes involved in the changes in species composition. The understorey plant community was highly affected starting from the intermediate stage of invasion. Species richness, diversity and total cover were all lower in invaded than in non-invaded plots, with a transition generally in the middle. In addition, plant community composition severely changed along the invasion gradient. The species set we recorded showed a nested structure, with the composition of species in the invaded plots representing a subset of the others. According to our findings, A. pycnantha exerted detrimental impacts on the native vegetation, mainly causing severe species loss in the understorey assemblage and impoverishment of the invaded ecosystems.
