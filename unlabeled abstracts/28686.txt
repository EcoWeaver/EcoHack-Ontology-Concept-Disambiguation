Do small mammals prey upon an invasive ectoparasite of cervids?
Predation is often considered an important factor for population regulation and in some cases for the invasion success of prey. Small mammalian predation may be a major force in the population regulation of many ground-dwelling invertebrate species. The deer ked (Lipoptena cervi (L., 1758)) is an ectoparasitic fly of cervids. The species has a large distribution area and it has relatively rapidly spread in northern Europe during the previous four decades. The factors possibly regulating the distribution and invasion of this fly are poorly known. During the off-host stage of several months, pupae of deer ked are likely exposed to many ground-dwelling predators. To study whether small mammals would feed on deer keds, we conducted experiments by serving pupae of deer ked to wild-captured common shrews (Sorex araneus L., 1758), bank voles (Myodes glareolus (Schreber, 1780)), field voles (Microtus agrestis (L., 1761)), and semi-wild bank voles, and assessed pupal survival. As a control, we provided alternative food including common nutrients used by small mammals in their natural habitats. The results show that variable amounts of pupae of deer ked are consumed by all small-mammal species studied. Surprisingly, insectivorous and most of the time food-constrained shrews consumed less pupae than granivorous-herbivorous voles.
