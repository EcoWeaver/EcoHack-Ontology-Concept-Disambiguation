Modeling of invasion on a heterogeneous habitat: taxis and multistability
We study a mathematical model of invasion in the case of two closely related species. The model is formulated as a system of nonlinear partial differential equations, which takes into account the diffusion and taxis of both species as well as their competition for a heterogeneous resource (carrying capacity). We derive analytical and numerical techniques based on the cosymmetry approach. Parameter relations are established for which the given model admits a continuous family of stationary distributions. This implies multistability, i.e. the existence of successful invasion scenarios with different final states. Then, we treat the general situation as a disturbance of this cosymmetric case and develop methods for forecasting. Numerical results of the one-dimensional spatial problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the chosen methodology. In particular, we show the possibility to predict, by accurate long-term calculations, final states in the case of slow evolution. Further, we are able to classify taxis parameters with respect to success or failure of an invasion.
