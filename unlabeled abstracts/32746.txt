Effect of corn dry distiller grains plus solubles supplementation level on performance and digestion characteristics of steers grazing native range during forage growing season
Two experiments were conducted to evaluate effects of corn dry distiller grains plus condensed solubles (DDGS) supplementation level on performance digestion characteristics of steers grazing native range during the forage growing season. In the performance study, 72 (206 +- 23.6 kg; 2008) and 60 (230 +- 11.3 kg; 2009) English crossbred steer calves were used in a randomized complete block design replicated over 2 yr. The grazing periods lasted 56 and 58 d, and started on August 11 and 18 for 2008 and 2009, respectively. Each yr steers were blocked by BW (light, medium, and heavy), stratified by BW within blocks, and randomly assigned to one of 4 grazing groups. Each grazing group (6 steers in 2008 and 5 in 2009) was assigned to a DDGS supplementation levels (0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6% BW). Grazing group served as the experimental unit with 12 groups per yr receiving 1 of 4 treatments for 2 yr (n = 6). In the metabolism study, 16 English-crossbred steers (360 +- 28.9 kg) fitted with ruminal cannulas grazing native range during the summer growing season were used in a completely randomized design to evaluate treatment effects on forage intake and digestion. The experiment was conducted during the first and second weeks of October, 2008. Steers were randomly assigned to supplement level (0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6% BW); n = 4) and grazed a single native range pasture with supplements offered individually once daily at 0700. In the performance study, ADG (0.64, 0.75, 0.80, and 0.86 +- 0.03 kg/d for 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6% BW, respectively) increased linearly (P = 0.01) with increasing DDGS supplementation level. In the metabolism study, forage OM, NDF, CP, and EE intake decreased (P <= 0.05) linearly with increasing DDGS supplementation level. Total CP and EE intake increased (P <= 0.002) with increasing DDGS supplementation level. Digestibility of OM, NDF, and EE increased (linear; P <= 0.008), while the soluble CP fraction of forage masticate sample linearly increased (P = 0.01) and slowly degradable CP fraction linearly decreased (P = 0.05) with increasing DDGS supplementation level. Forage in situ masticate DM and NDF disappearance rate decreased (quadratic; P <= 0.05) and DDGS in situ DM disappearance rate increased (linear; P = 0.03) with increasing supplementation levels. These results indicate that DDGS supplementation enhanced grazing performance and total-tract digestion of steers grazing native range during the forage growing season.
