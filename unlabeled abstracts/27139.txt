Alien fly populations established at two Antarctic research stations
The populations of two non-native Dipterans have been established at two Antarctic research stations since at least 1998. Both belong to Sciaridae (black fungus midge), and have been determined to the genus Lycoriella. At Rothera Research Station, Antarctic Peninsula, flies are present in the station alcohol bond store, while at Casey Station, on the coast of continental Antarctica, a second Lycoriella sp. is found breeding in the station sewage facilities. Neither species is thought capable of surviving outside the protected environment of the research station buildings, but their establishment highlights the need for strict quarantine controls in order for National Operators in the Antarctic to conform to the Environmental Protocol of the Antarctic Treaty and prevent the introduction of alien species into Antarctica. Protocols for fly eradication are currently being implemented.
