Analysis and diagnosis of the state of conservation and restoration of paper-based artifacts: A non-invasive approach
We report a non-invasive and multi-analytical physico-chemical method for the characterization of paper artworks, able to identify sizing, inks, and glues and to quantify oxidative degradation by-products. The proposed methodology is mostly carried out in situ by using easy-to-use and cheap portable instrumentation for the acquisition of multispectral images, punctual ultraviolet-visible-near infrared fiber-optics reflectance spectroscopy (FORS) and punctual fiber optics fluorescence spectroscopy. Further analytical information is provided by non-invasive in-situ sampling of paper surface by using soft latex sponges, making possible laboratory chromatographic and infrared spectroscopic analyses on the aqueous sponge extracts. The proposed diagnostics method was applied to two 17th century letters written by St Francis of Sales (1567-1622), collected at the Chigi Palace in the town of Ariccia (Italy). Results show an intense oxidative degradation of the letters, also localized in water spots, and the presence of carboxylic acids by-products. Analysis of FORS spectra provided the concentration of chromophores in the paper substrate. The diagnostic method allowed the identification of gelatin sizing, the presence of starch glue in specific areas of the letters and the type of ink used in the text. Our diagnostic approach aims to offer to conservator-restorer a characterization of a paper artwork, that can be applied to other, for a correct planning of conservation interventions.
