Simulated Small Scale Disturbances Increase Decomposition Rates and Facilitates Invasive Species Encroachment in a High Elevation Tropical Andean Peatland
Tropical alpine peatlands are important carbon reservoirs and are a critical component of local hydrological cycles. In high elevation peatlands slow decomposition rates result from a nutrient-poor substrate resistant to decay. The responses of paramo peatland ecosystems to increased nutrient additions and physical disturbance due to agricultural activities are unknown. Here, we conducted a two-year fertilization and physical disturbance experiment in a Sphagnumdominated peatland in the Central Andes of Colombia. We hypothesized that fertilization and physical disturbance will diminish the ability of the peat to store organic matter by increasing decomposition and that vascular plants will displace Sphagnum as the dominant plant group. We simulated cattle activity by adding manure as a fertilizer and physical disturbance as a proxy for cattle trampling. Species composition varied in proportion to the intensity of disturbance. Sphagnum cover was reduced under any disturbance treatment. Non-native grasses usually found in cattle pastures invaded treatments with fertilizer additions or physical disturbance. Overall aboveground plant biomass doubled in fertilized treatments, suggesting that plant biomass production was nutrient limited. Decomposition rates tripled in disturbed treatments as compared to controls. This reduces the ability of the peatland to store organic matter. Andean peatlands are prized ecological assets; however, our results show that the El Morro paramo peatland experienced increased decomposition rates over short time periods after small-scale disturbances. This created profound consequences for the ecological services offered by these peatlands.
