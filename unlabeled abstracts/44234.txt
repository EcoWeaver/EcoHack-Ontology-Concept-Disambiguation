The reuse of bio-waste from the invasive species Tradescantia fluminensis as a source of phenolic compounds.
Phenolic compounds have numerous applications for different industrial sectors, where this natural raw material from bio-waste would help to achieve more sustainable production. To optimize extraction in the invasive species Tradescantia fluminensis the response surface methodology, specifically the Box-Behnken design (BBD), was used to investigate the effects of three independent variables, namely time (hour), temperature (degC) and solvent type (distilled water, ethanol and hexane) on the response, total phenolic content (TPC). Statistical analysis for the optimized conditions revealed that the best TPC extraction was obtained for stems with hexane, at 45 degC, 4 h (8.45 mg GAE/g) and for leaves with distilled water, 35 degC, 4 h (4.69 mg GAE/g). The identification of the extracts from the different parts by HPLC-MS/MS reported a high content of phenolic acids and a low content of flavonoids. The phenolic acids mostly present were sinapic acid and ferulic acid, mainly in the stem fraction. The presence of these acids with high antioxidant potential makes T. fluminensis interesting for pharmaceutical and food preservation applications. The current management of bio-waste resulting from invasive species control actions are not fully effective and sometimes may result in other problems. If this type of plant material proves to contain potential for use to industry, it could become established within a circular and sustainable bioeconomy.
