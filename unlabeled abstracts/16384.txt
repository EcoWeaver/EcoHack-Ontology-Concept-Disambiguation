The end of Invasion Biology: intellectual debate does not equate to nonsensical science
Val,ry et al. recently proposed to end the field of Invasion Biology on the grounds that it is based on an inadequate definition of the concept of biological invasion and that, as exotic species, native species should also be called invasive whenever they outbreak. We argue, on the contrary, that the sudden demographic dominance of native species cannot be termed invasion. Moreover, we claim that the suggestion of ending a fruitful and useful discipline because it does not conform to a subjective definition or because it still encompasses some debatable ideas and unresolved questions is both irrelevant and excessive. We believe that the thousands of researchers working in this discipline do not perform nonsensical science, and that their efforts to understand and limit biological invasions are compatible with debating on the key concept of that field.
