Performance of eight tree species in the highland Vertisols of central Ethiopia: growth, foliage nutrient concentration and effect on soil chemical properties
The coverage of trees in the highland Vertisol areas of Ethiopia is very scarce. A tree screening trial was conducted from 1997 to 2002 in Ginchi (central Ethiopia) to select fast growing and high biomass producing tree species; evaluate foliage macronutrient concentration of different tree species; and assess effects of trees on soil chemical properties beneath their canopies. Acacia decurrens Willd, A. mearnsii De Wild and Eucalyptus globulus Labill attained the highest height growth at 64months as compared to other indigenous and exotic species. E. globulus provided better height increment from 24 to 36 and 36 to 64months than other tree and shrub species. Acacia mearnssi and A. saligna Labill Wendl produced high biomass at 40 and 64months. Differences between the highest and lowest dry biomass at 12, 40 and 64months were 1.13, 29.19 and 38.89kg tree-1, respectively. None of the tree species resulted in a foliage to stem biomass ratio of >0.98at 40 and 64months. Sesbania sesban (L.) Merr had high N and P concentrations in its foliages and stems at 12 and 40months. Total N under Acacia abyssinica Hochst. Ex Benth, A.saligna and S. sesban was slightly greater at 40months than 12months.
