Propagule pressure from invasive plant species in gardens in low-density suburban areas of the Costa Brava (Spain)
tA substantial proportion of the cultivated plants in urban domestic gardens in Europe are exotic species.Among these species, a large number may become invasive, causing negative impacts on natural areas. Toprevent this situation, the early detection of invasive species and the assessment of propagule pressureplay a key role. In this study, we analyse the flora of 258 domestic gardens in the Costa Brava to explore theimportance of these factors in these urban ecosystems. Of the 635 taxa identified, 68% were exotic (77%considering only cultivated plants). Moreover, 39 species were considered invasive in Spain, althoughonly 25 were present within the limits of the adjacent Aiguamolls de l'Emporda Natural Park (AENP).The results from multiple regression models showed that all plant biodiversity parameters (overall plantrichness and exotic and native plant richness) were strongly related to the garden area, the occupancy rateof the house and the different socio-economic and cognitive characteristics of the household members. Adistance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) showed that the invasive species composition was relatedto the garden area, the age of the building, the income level and the proportion of non-working residents.We also detected that garden centres were by far the most used source of horticultural species, althoughgarden plants were replaced and/or renewed after relatively long periods of time. We conclude thatinfluencing homeowners' preferences by providing more detailed information in garden centres andnurseries may lead to the creation and restructuring of more native and environmentally friendly privatelandscapes.
