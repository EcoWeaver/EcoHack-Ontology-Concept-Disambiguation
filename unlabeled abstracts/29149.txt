Drivers of invasive tree and shrub natural regeneration in temperate forests
We assessed drivers of ecological success along resource availability gradients for three invasive woody species: Prunus serotina Ehrh., Quercus rubra L. and Robinia pseudoacacia L. We aimed to check how much of invasion success, measured by invader biomass, is explained by propagule pressure and plant community invasibility. Using 3 years of observations from 372 study plots (100 m2 each) in temperate forests of Wielkopolski National Park (Poland) we investigated the hierarchy of predictors and partial dependencies using the random forest method. Our study indicated that propagule pressure explained more variance in success of invaders than invasibility--describing availability of resources and competitors in understory vegetation. We also found different responses of seedlings and saplings, connected with dependence on stored carbohydrates, which decreased seedling responses to resource availability gradients. However, resource availability (light and leaf litter predictors) had greater influence than predictors describing understory vegetation. Based on importance and response strength the species studied may be arranged by decreasing requirements for soil fertility and acidity: P. serotina < Q. rubra < R. pseudoacacia, whereas for light requirements and competition vulnerability the order is: P. serotina > Q. rubra > R. pseudoacacia. However, low light requirements of R. pseudoacacia may be biased by high proportion of sprouts supplied by parental trees. Results provide guidelines for effective management of invasive woody species in forest ecosystems and describe complex interactions between factors studied on ecological success of invaders.
