Low prairie plant communities of wetlands as a function of disturbance: Physical parameters
Understanding how physical parameters within and adjacent to Prairie Pothole Region wetlands affect the surrounding biological communities is important for sound management decisions for agricultural and rangeland settings. We evaluated the wetland, adjacent non-wetland, and landscape physical parameters role in determining low prairie (sub-irrigated) species composition. We first developed hypothetical models using the physical variables collected from 193 wetlands in relation to the existing plant communities. The models were then evaluated using structural equation modeling and a final (alternative) model was developed from these results. The models developed indicated the importance of the low prairie community in proper ecological functioning of associated wetlands. A number of physical parameters measured can be used as indicators of declining plant community condition, one example being the potential of the low prairie plant community to be invaded by exotic species such as Bromus inermis Leyss.
