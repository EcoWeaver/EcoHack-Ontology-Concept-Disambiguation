Homeowner perceptions and responses to buffelgrass invasion risk in the Tucson, Arizona Wildland-Urban Interface
In this study, we aimed to analyze homeowners' level of awareness and perceived risk about buffelgrass invasion in the Tucson, Arizona Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), as well as the factors influencing their participation in buffelgrass control and fire risk mitigation efforts. Data for the study were generated through the administration of an online survey among 117 members of Home Owner Associations (HOAs) in the Tucson WUI. The results showed that the overwhelming majority of respondents were aware of buffelgrass, but their knowledge about buffelgrass control mechanisms appeared to be limited. Respondents also more frequently expressed concern about the risks posed by buffelgrass invasion to general targets, such as the Sonoran Desert ecosystem, native plants and wildlife than risks to their private property and neighborhoods. The results also showed that the level of involvement in HOAs, and leadership in HOAs had significant positive effects on homeowners' participation in buffelgrass control efforts. Homeowners' duration of residence also had a significant negative effect on participation in buffelgrass control efforts, suggesting that newcomers may be more involved than long-term residents. Similarly, the number of months respondents spent in Tucson per year had a negative effect on the number of hours spent on buffelgrass control efforts. Respondents' perceived risk about buffelgrass invasion also had a positive effect on the hours spent on buffelgrass control as well as their level of involvement in fire risk mitigation efforts. These results highlight the importance of local institutions and community heterogeneity in social responses to threats in WUI communities. Policies aimed at building the resilience of WUI communities need to account for their complexity as coupled social-ecological systems.
