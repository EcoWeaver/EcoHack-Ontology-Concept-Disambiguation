Total mercury and methylmercury concentrations in native and invasive fish species in Shadegan International Wetland, Iran, and health risk assessment
Human exposure to mercury (Hg) mainly occurs through consumption of aquatics, especially fish. In aquatic systems, the bioaccumulation of Hg across trophic levels could be altered by invasive species through changing community composition. The present study is aimed at measuring total mercury (T-Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in non-native (redbelly tilapia (Tilapia zillii)) and native (Benni (Mesopotamichthys sharpeyi) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio)) fish species throughout Shadegan International Wetland and comparing health risk of their mercury contents to the local population. The concentrations were measured using a direct mercury analyzer (DMA 80). The average values of T-Hg and MeHg for native fishes were 19.8 and 10.49 mg/kg. These concentrations for the invasive fish were 28 and 14.62 mg/kg respectively. Despite having less length and weight than the native fish species, tilapia showed significantly higher T-Hg content, yet the lowest concentration of MeHg was observed in common carp with larger body length and weight. Concerning mercury health risk to consumers, tilapia demonstrated the highest estimated weekly intake (EWI) and percentages of tolerable weekly intake (%TWI) for both T-Hg and MeHg, while the highest hazard quotient (HQ) values were obtained for tilapia and Benni. Taken together, the mercury concentrations in the two native and non-native fishes were acceptable according to the international safety guidelines although the local people shall be warned for consumption of tilapia. Furthermore, the low calculated value of tissue residue criterion (TRC) for the wetland fishes sounds a warning.
