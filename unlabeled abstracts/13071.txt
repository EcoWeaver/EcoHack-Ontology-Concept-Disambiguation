Effects of salinity on the survival and aggression of the invasive Rio Grande cichlid (Herichthys cyanoguttatus)
The spread of non-native Rio Grande cichlids (Herichthys cyanoguttatus) in southeast Louisiana includes brackish habitats. We studied the effects of three different salinity levels on the biology of juvenile H. cyanoguttatus for 13 months to determine the potential of this species to spread through local estuaries. The highest salinity tolerated was 30.0 psu, and these fish did not survive acclimation to the 32 psu treatment. Fish in brackish conditions grew slower than fish in freshwater conditions, indicating a potential long-term detriment to juvenile fish living in brackish conditions. Aggression levels were notably higher for fish in brackish (15 psu) vs. freshwater conditions. This persisted through the entire experiment even after acclimation back to freshwater. This study indicates that higher salinity habitats in Louisiana can be tolerated by this species. It also raises a question about the effect of higher salinities on aggressive behavior.
