Reproduction revisited--a decade of changes in the reproductive strategies of an invasive catfish, Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus (Weber, 1991), in Volusia Blue Spring, Florida
The reproductive patterns of invasive species may undergo changes in response to the pressures of a novel environment. We tracked the reproductive strategies of Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus collected in Volusia Blue Spring, adjoining the St. Johns River, over a 10 year period from 2005 through 2014. After analyzing various measures of fecundity and reproductive seasonality, we found that during that time period, P. disjunctivus reduced investment in individual offspring, while increasing overall fecundity and GSI. In addition, its reproductive season had expanded, and seasonal differences in nearly all measures became significantly smaller. This species does not seem to fit into any one reproductive strategy, nor has it moved in a consistent direction within the Winemiller-Rose reproductive strategy scheme. We suggest that despite the value of such schemes in predicting responses to environmental parameters, they may not be able to adequately describe the strategies of invasive species that have access to ecosystems that are more benign than their native habitats.
