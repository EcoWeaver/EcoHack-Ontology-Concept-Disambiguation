Anatomical study of seed and fruit morphology of an invasive weed buffalobur (Solanum Rostratum Dunal)
Solanum rostratum Dunal, commonly known as buffalobur, is an invasive species in China. It caused significant damage to natural ecosystem, agricultural production and human health in many countries. Seed and fruit morphology of S. rostratum were examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and stereomicroscope. The seed surface of S. rostratum was characterized by palisading hair-like structures which surrounded each depressed cellular reticula. Two types of ultrastructure were firstly observed on the surface of reticula, differing in arrangements of fingerlike projections and the number of tilted holes. A visible cavity was found between endosperm and micropyle region. Knowledge obtained in this study would provide useful information in identification of Solanum species in plant quarantine and understanding its wide adaption to the environments.
