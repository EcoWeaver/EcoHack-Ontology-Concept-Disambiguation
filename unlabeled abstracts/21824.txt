Rodent seed predation on tree invader species in grassland habitats of the inland Pampa
Woody plant invasion in grassland ecosystems is a worldwide phenomenon, and biotic interactions as competition and predation have been invoked as a possible barrier to woody encroachment in many eco-systems. We evaluated the role of rodents as seed pre-dators in Pampean grasslands, and we assessed the differences in removal by rodents between one native species, Prosopis caldenia (Calde) and one exotic spe-cies, Gleditisia triacanthos (Honey locust). The experi-ment was conducted at different phases of the rodent population cycle in two grassland communities, a rem-nant of a native grassland and a post agriculture grass-land (old field). The amount of seed loss caused by predation was estimated by a bait-removal experiment in foraging stations. We estimated the frequency of forag-ing stations with consumption, the overall amount of seed predation and the individual rate of seed predation. The total amount of seed removal and the individual rate of seed removal were higher for P. caldenia than for G. triacanthos, in the native grassland than in the old field, and in autumn when rodent density was maximum. Overall, the role of rodents on woody seed removal varied according to the plant species and depending on the local conditions that vary through time and space.
