A comparative analysis of engagement strategies for invasive alien species among Australia, Canada, New Zealand and United States: Case studies of forest pest insects
Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States operate some of the most advanced quarantine systems and cooperate on a quadrilateral scientific collaborative program in plant biosecurity. Through workshops, electronic information exchange and expert advice under the auspices of this program, country-specific engagement strategies for Invasive Alien Species (IAS) were obtained with the objective of comparing them and recommending risk management options to enhance effectiveness. The emphasis of this study was on invasive alien forest pest insects: Asian Gypsy Moth (Lymantria dispar), Asian Longhorned Beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis), Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis) and the European Wood Wasp (Sirex noctilio). Comparative analysis of the data indicates that these strategies form a complex, non-linear system comprising two highly interdependent levels of decision making: a strategic level set around five strategic goals and implemented through 16 strategic approaches, and an operational level set around a highly-variable set of context-sensitive criteria. This paper will focus on the strategic level, providing innovative, country-specific approaches along with pest-specific best-management practices and success stories in relation to the selected case studies. It outlines the scope, guiding principles, goals, and approaches used by all four countries to engage with IAS, and provides an efficient resource allocation pattern as evidenced by success stories from these case studies.
