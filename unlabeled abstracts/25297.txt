A Strategy for Restoration of Montane Forest in Anthropogenic Fern Thickets in the Dominican Republic
Deforested tropical areas are often colonized by competitive ferns that inhibit forest succession. In thickets of such a fern (Dicranopteris pectinata), we investigated methods for initiating restoration of tropical montane forest in the Ebano Verde Scientific Reserve (Dominican Republic). In clearings in the thickets, growth and survivorship of 18 common early- and late-successional woody species were tested, with and without fertilizer (poultry litter). Three years after sowing, life history did not affect survivorship, but early-successional species grew faster than late-successional species (height increase 153 +- 103 cm vs. 81 +- 67 cm [mean +- 1 SD]). Inga fagifolia, a late-successional species, and Alchornea latifolia, an early-successional species, had 160 +- 62 cm mean height increase, and low mortality rates (<4%). In contrast, four late-successional species (Cyrilla racemiflora, Myrcia deflexa, Prestoea acuminata var. montana, and Mora abbottii), and one early-successional species, Ocotea leucoxylon, had approximately 39% mortality and height increase of 43 +- 48 cm. Brunellia comocladifolia had high mortality (55%), but averaged 340 +- 201 cm height increase, and was the only species whose growth was improved by fertilization. Fertilization improved survivorship of only one species, Piper aduncum. After three years, soils in the clearings had low pH and available P and did not differ significantly from soils in thickets. However, based on the growth rates and survivorship of sown woody plants, these soils did not appear to be a barrier for restoration. Although a complementary study demonstrated substantial natural regeneration, active planting should be used to increase plant density and diversity, especially where natural regeneration is poor.
