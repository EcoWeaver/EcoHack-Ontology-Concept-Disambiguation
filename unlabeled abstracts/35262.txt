An Analysis of Habitat Suitability and Charcoal-Yielding Characteristics of Five Exotic Tree Species Intended for Bioenergy Production in Jamaica
In Jamaica large quantities of wood are harvested annually for the production of charcoal. In the process, many of the island's native forests have been over-harvested. In an effort to diminish harvesting pressures on local forests, we propose a framework to assist with identifying potential planting sites for five exotic fuelwood species (i.e., Acacia auriculiformis, Casuarina equisetifolia, Leucaena leucocephala, Prosopis juliflora, and Senna siamea) intended for the commercial production of biomass energy in Jamaica. Suitable planting sites are identified according to (i) the species' biophysical requirements, (ii) natural life-zone delimitations based, in part, on Digital Elevation Model (DEM)-based calculations of annual biotemperature, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration, and (iii) soil pH. The paper also provides a detailed scientific analysis of fuelwood growth and yield characteristics, as well as fuelwood-burning and charcoal-yielding characteristics for plants grown in a model fuelwood project on the southwest coast of Jamaica. Mass production of charcoal is considered feasible with two of the five fuelwood species considered, namely A. auriculiformis and L. leucocephala. Both species have high charcoal yields (>20 Mg ha-1), comparatively good charcoal-to-dry weight conversion ratios (>20%), high heating value (>14.4 MJ kg-1), and an abundance of suitable planting sites across the island. S. siamea had a greater number of planting sites identified, but its heating potential (14.2 MJ kg-1) and charcoal yield (14%) were the lowest among the five species evaluated.
