Colonization history affects heating rates of invasive cane toads
AbstractAmphibians in hot climates may be able to avoid high temperatures by controlling their rates of heating. In northern Australia, invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) experience hot dry conditions in newly-colonized (western) sites but milder conditions in longer-occupied (eastern) sites. Under standardized conditions, toads from western sites heated less rapidly than did conspecifics from an eastern site. The availability of free water slowed heating rates of eastern but not western toads. Thus, the colonization of climatically extreme sites has been accompanied by a rapid shift in the toads' ability to remain cool under hot conditions, even when free water is not available.
