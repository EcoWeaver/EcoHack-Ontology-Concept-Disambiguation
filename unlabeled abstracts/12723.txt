Evaluating the efficacy of invasive plant control in response to ecological factors
Biological invasions have increased dramatically in the past centuries and are one of the greatest threats to biodiversity today. Chromolaena odorata, a herbaceous shrub from the Americas, is one of the most widespread and problematic invasive plant species in the tropics and sub-tropics. The plant is a serious problem in South Africa, where invasive species threaten biodiversity and use up water resources. This study combines data on the distribution of C. odorata with ecological and clearing management data to evaluate the efficacy of an invasive plant clearing program over its decade of operation in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Densities and local extent of the C. odorata invasion were significantly reduced during the period of operations of the clearing program. Seasonal effects impacted clearing efficacy, namely a reduction in efficacy during the seed dispersal period. Clearing success was positively associated with clearing effort and fire frequency and negatively associated with rainfall. Management implications drawn from the results include halting clearing during the seed-drop period, giving extra attention to areas with more rainfall and other water availability, and incorporating fire with other clearing methods where possible.
