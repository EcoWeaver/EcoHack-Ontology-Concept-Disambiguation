Post-Fire Management of Exotic Forests
Forests dominated by exotic tree species represent around 5% of all European forests, including plantations and self-sown exotic forests. The management of burned exotic forests is characterized taking into account specific aspects related with the protection of soils and the restoration of natural vegetation. Given its increasing importance, the chapter includes a synthetic review on the ecology of invasive tree species and their relationship with fire. Different post-fire management practices and alternatives are described for some of the most common sub-types of exotic forests in southern Europe. Two case studies are presented, including relevant information for the post-fire management of Acacia longifolia woodlands and Eucalyptus globulus plantations.
