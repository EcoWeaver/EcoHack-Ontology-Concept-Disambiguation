Assessing population status of Parachondrostoma arrigonis (Steindachner, 1866), threats and conservation perspectives
Biodiversity is currently declining in the Med-iterranean, particularly in freshwater ecosystems. The Iberian Peninsula is not an exception with many fish species threatened or endangered. This is the case of Parachondrostoma arrigonis, which has experienced a marked reduction of more than 80 % in both number and area of occupancy in the last 20 years. Species historical records showed a widespread distribution in the Jucar Basin, but according to recent records, P. arrigonis was completely absent in the main river course, being restrict-ed to only some tributaries. Current fish distribution was grouped into only seven fish population nuclei geographically isolated among them. Only two popula-tion nuclei showed with well-developed fish populations. Factors affecting P. arrigonis distribution are associated to human activities, such as river channelization, flow regulation, pollution and habitat degradation, being con-centrated in the middle and lower river reaches where the Jucar nase is in marked regression. Another key factor was the presence of introduced species, reporting a strong spatial segregation with the translocated Pseudochondrostoma polylepis, an ecologically similar species, and with the exotic piscivorous Micropterus salmoides and Esox lucius, which are currently occupy-ing most of the P. arrigonis historical range. Because its dramatic situation, conservation measures must be ur-gently taken, for instance, by establishing conservation areas, an exotic fish removal programme, and by devel-oping a flow regulation program to minimize dam effects. However it is necessary to increase our knowledge re-garding the habitat requirements of the Jucar nase and its interactions with invasive species. If measures are not implemented its extinction seems inevitable.
