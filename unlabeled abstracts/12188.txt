Extended leaf phenology may drive plant invasion through direct and apparent competition
Invasive plants can inflict great harm, yet drivers of successful invasion remain unclear. Many invaders of North American deciduous forests exhibit extended leaf phenology (ELP), or longer growing season relative to natives. ELP may grant invaders competitive advantages, but we argue that ELP more potently drives invasion in the presence of herbivores. ELP invaders can support herbivores by lessening starvation during winter; consequently, native plants may suffer when attacked later through apparent competition. As modeled here, even short ELP can promote competitive success of invaders, and apparent competition sharply enhances ELP invader dominance. In 'partial enemy escape' scenarios, a less palatable ELP invader nearly excludes a preferred native where an invader without ELP could not. Together, ELP and apparent competition enhance invasion even when biotic resistance should suppress it, i.e. when the invader competes weakly or provides preferred forage. Thus, ELP-apparent competition interactions grant invaders considerable success while challenging core tenets of invasion ecology.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
