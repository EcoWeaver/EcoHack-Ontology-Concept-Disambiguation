Vulnerability of native and exotic urban birds to housing densification and changing gardening and landscaping trends
Variation in densities of native and exotic urban-adapted birds across suburban habitats may reveal levels of adaptation that predict vulnerability to habitat modification over time. We investigated the densities of the eight most common exotic and native birds in a southern hemisphere city across suburbs of varying housing density, vegetative cover and garden vegetation characteristics to determine whether avian population densities are maintained across variations in habitat structure that mirror current temporal trends in land use and landscaping/gardening preferences. We also tested whether densities of birds in residential areas bordering undeveloped patches were higher due to spill-over from patches. Densities of all four native species were highest in undeveloped patches and these species were largely absent from high density housing areas. While densities of two exotic species (blackbird, song thrush) were slightly higher in suburbs with greater vegetation complexity, they were still present in higher density housing suburbs in significant numbers. Common starlings were similarly abundant across all residential habitats and house sparrow density increased in higher density housing areas. Blackbirds appeared least vulnerable to housing densification and landscaping and gardening trends because they were abundant across all habitats, including undeveloped patches. Densities of native birds were higher in residential areas bordering undeveloped patches indicating spill-over was occurring and emphasising the role that patches could play in boosting city-wide native bird abundances. Native birds are vulnerable to reductions in garden size and vegetation complexity that should have little or positive effects on populations of common exotic species.
