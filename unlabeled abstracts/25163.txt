Hosts and distribution ofViscum albumL. ssp.albumin Croatia and Slovenia
Viscum album L. ssp. album is semi-parasitic on deciduous trees and shrubs. In order to identify hosts and map the distribution of V. album ssp. album in Croatia and Slovenia, field research was carried out, and herbaria were surveyed. In Croatia and Slovenia, V. album ssp. album occurred on 59 taxa. In Croatia, there were 52 hosts (33 autochthonous and 15 allochthonous species, two cultivars and two hybrids). In Slovenia, there were 25 hosts (21 autochthonous and four allochthonous species). There were 18 hosts common to both countries, 34 hosts were found only in Croatia, and seven hosts only in Slovenia. The hosts belonged to 13 families. The majority of these (19 species) belong to the Rosaceae, followed by Salicaceae, Aceraceae, Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Juglandaceae, Tiliaceae, Hippocastanaceae, Ulmaceae, Oleaceae, Fabaceae, Moraceae and Viscaceae. All hosts have been previously recorded in the literature, except Alnus japonica (Thunb.) Steud., Amelanchier lamarckii F.G. Schroed. and Crataegus nigra Waldst. et Kit. The distribution of this mistletoe was scattered, due to the scattered distribution of hosts, local conditions, movement of bird-vectors, etc. A continuous distribution was found only in part of the distribution area of narrow-leaved ash (Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl).
