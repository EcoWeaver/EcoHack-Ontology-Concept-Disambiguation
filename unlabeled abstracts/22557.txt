Diversity and abundance of earthworms in land use systems in central-western Colombia
The neotropical landscapes of Colombia's Andean region are characterized by a mosaic of agroecosystems presenting a range of vegetational cover for which soil fauna adaptation is still unknown. To analyze the diversity and abundance of earthworm species in relation to changes in selected soil physical and chemical parameters (bulk density, C stock, N stock, %C, %N, 13C, 15N, C:N ratio), these systems were classified into five categories according to land use intensity: non-intensive (NI), low intensity (LI), medium intensity (MI), high intensity (HI), and maximum intensity (IN). The influence of livestock production was confirmed in the significant differences observed in bulk density and 15N between NI, HI, and IN (P
