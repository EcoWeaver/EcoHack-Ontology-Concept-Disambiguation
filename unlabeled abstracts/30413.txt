New records of an invasive bumble bee in northern Chile: expansion of its range or new introduction events?
The Eurasian bumble bee Bombus terrestris Linnaeus has been used commercially for pollination of a large number of crop species worldwide. This species has become invasive in several countries where it has escaped into natural environments. This species has become naturalized in many zones of Chile and southern Argentina, and may potentially invade other regions and countries in South America. These naturalized populations of B. terrestris have been associated with rapid population declines of the native bee B. dahlbomii Guerin-Meneville. We report new records of the exotic bee B. terrestris in the Region de Arica y Parinacota in the far north of Chile, which includes portions of the Atacama Desert. We used species distribution models (SDMs) and multivariate analyses to evaluate whether these occurrences represent new escapes from managed colonies or natural dispersal of the species from its southern invaded range. These reports of B. terrestris indicate a northward expansion of this bee. In our analyses, these new areas of occurrences have environmental conditions similar to those observed in the species' southern invaded range, and our SDMs predict that B. terrestris dispersal through the Atacama is possible, although not likely given the occasional flower blooming in that region of Chile. These new occurrences in northern Chile reflect a potential for future invasion into other regions of South America by B. terrestris. Future surveys in the area should be intensified to evaluate if viable populations of this invasive species may become established.
