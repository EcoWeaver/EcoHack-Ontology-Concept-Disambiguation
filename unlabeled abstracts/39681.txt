Linking traits of invasive plants with ecosystem services and disservices
Invasive alien species (IAS) have negative as well as positive effects on human well-being. They can alter ecosystem properties, functions and associated ecosystem services (ES). However, many IAS have negative effects (resulting from reducing ES or by increasing or creating ecosystem disservices (EDS), the latter termed genuine negative effects) on, e.g. biodiversity, crop and timber production and/or human health. We present a novel framework, linking traits of IAS via ES and EDS to affected environmental and socioeconomic sectors. By applying the framework, we were able to identify whether a plant trait affects different sectors (positively and/or negatively) and whether the same trait impacts one but benefits another sector. Positive effects correspond to an increase in ES/a reduction in EDS whereas impact represents a reduction in ES/an increase in EDS. The framework is applicable across traits and species, including the direction (positive/negative) and strength of effects. Furthermore, we classified six socioeconomic and environmental sectors frequently affected (positively or negatively) by invasive plants, along with the list of ES and EDS relevant in these sectors. The framework can be used as a tool for assessing multiple ES and EDS and for prioritizing the management of affected sectors.
