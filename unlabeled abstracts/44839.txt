What Really Works? Testing Augmented and Virtual Reality Messaging in Terrestrial Invasive Species Management Communications to Impact Visitor Preferences and Deter Visitor Displacement
Natural resource management is rapidly shifting to incorporate a deeper understanding of ecological processes and functioning, including attention to invasive species. The shift to understand public perceptions of resource management and invasives is much slower. Information influences both landscape preference and behaviors. Theory suggests that increasingly engaging information should have concurrently greater impacts. This research tested the effect of increasingly engaging information on visitor preferences and intentions to return to landscapes treated in response to emerald ash borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis). Park visitors in a midwestern-U.S. state randomly received one of four messages about forest management in response to EAB (control, photo, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)). Messaging impacted preferences for three of the four management approaches, but significant changes in displacement intentions emerged in only one of the four. Specifically, VR and AR increased preferences for complete harvest compared to photos/text, but not differently from those who received no information. VR significantly lowered preferences for select harvest with natural regeneration. The photo/text treatment increased preference for select harvest with planted trees over no information. Any information reduced displacement in response to a photo depicting "select harvest, planted trees." Subsequently judicious use of advanced communications like VR can optimize increasing scarce resources and maintain or optimize ecological services. Future research directions across geographic and content areas are recommended.
