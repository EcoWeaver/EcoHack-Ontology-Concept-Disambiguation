Predicting Establishment Potential of an Invasive Wood-Boring Beetle, Trichoferus campestris (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in the United States
AbstractSolid wood packaging material (WPM) is widely recognized as a high-risk pathway for transport and potential introduction of wood-boring insects, including longhorned beetles in the family Cerambycidae. These beetles also are occasionally imported in finished wood products, such as furniture and decorative items. A targeted effort to identify wood borers intercepted as larvae in WPM at U.S. ports between 2012 and 2018 revealed that one of the most frequently intercepted species was Trichoferus campestris (Faldermann), a cerambycid native to Asia. Trichoferus campestris is a pest of quarantine concern in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The establishment risk of this beetle in the United States is high because of its frequent introduction through multiple pathways and its potential to inhabit natural and urban forests as well as agricultural systems. In this study, we compiled port interception and detection data to examine risk based on historical introductions and pathways. We tested whether the intended destination of cargo intercepted with T. campestris-infested WPM can be used as a predictor of inland introductions, assuming that individuals of T. campestris are likely to be moved through established trade routes between export-import partners. We also developed maps to predict likely areas of introduction and establishment in the United States based on pathway analysis and climate suitability data. The maps will enable informed prioritization of resources in pest surveillance, and may serve as models for other wood borers identified in the WPM and wood products pathway.
