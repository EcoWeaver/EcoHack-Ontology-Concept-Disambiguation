The response of nitrogen cycling and bacterial communities to E. coli invasion in aquatic environments with submerged vegetation
s The effects of exogenous Escherichia coli on nitrogen cycling (N-cycling) in freshwater remains unclear. Thus, seven ecosystems, six with submerged plants--Potamogeton crispus (PC) and Myriophyllum aquaticum (MA)--and one with no plants were set up. Habitats were assessed before and after E. coli addition (107 colony-forming units/mL). E. coli colonization of freshwater ecosystems had significant effects on bacterial community structure in plant surface biofilms and surface sediments (ANOVA, P < 0.05). It reduced the relative abundance of nitrosification bacteria (-70.94 +- 26.17%) and nitrifiers (-47.86 +- 23.68%) in biofilms which lead to significant reduction of ammoxidation in water (P < 0.05). The N-cycling intensity from PC systems was affected more strongly by E. coli than were MA systems. Furthermore, the coupling coefficient of exogenous E. coli to indigenous N-cycling bacteria in sediments (6.061, average connectivity degree) was significantly weaker than that in biofilms (9.852). Additionally, at the genus level, E. coli were most-closely associated with N-cycling bacteria such as Prosthecobacter, Hydrogenophaga, and Bacillus in sediments and biofilms according to co-occurrence bacterial network (Spearman). E. coli directly changed their abundance, so that the variability of species composition of N-cycling bacterial taxa was triggered, as well. Overall, exogenous E. coli repressed ammoxidation, but promoted ammonification and denitrification. Our results provided new insights into how pathogens influence the nitrogen cycle in freshwater ecosystems.
