Patterns of phylogenetic diversity are linked to invasion impacts, not invasion resistance, in a native grassland
There are often more invasive species in communities that are less phylogenetically diverse or distantly related to the invaders. This is thought to indicate reduced biotic resistance, but recent theory predicts that phylogenetic relationships have more influence on competitive outcomes when interactions are more pair-wise than diffuse. Therefore, phylogenetic relationships should change when the invader becomes dominant and interactions are more pair-wise, rather than alter biotic resistance, which is the outcome of diffuse interactions with the resident community; however both processes can produce similar phylogenetic structures within communities. We ask whether phylogenetic structure is more associated with biotic resistance or invasion impacts following Bromus inermis (brome) invasion and identify the mechanisms behind changes to phylogenetic structure.
