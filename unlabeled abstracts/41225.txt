Species Distribution Models of the Spartina alterniflora Loisel in Its Origin and Invasive Country Reveal an Ecological Niche Shift
Spartina alterniflora is a perennial herb native to the American Atlantic coast and is the dominant plant in coastal intertidal wetlands. Since its introduction to China in 1979, it has quickly spread along the coast and has caused various hazards. To control the further spread of S. alterniflora in China, we first reconstructed the history of the spread of S. alterniflora in its invasion and origin countries. We found that S. alterniflora spreads from the central coast to both sides of the coast in China, while it spreads from the west coast to the east coast in America. Furthermore, by comparing 19 environmental variables of S. alterniflora in its invasion and origin countries, it was found that S. alterniflora is more and more adaptable to the high temperature and dry environment in the invasion country. Finally, we predicted the suitable areas for this species in China and America using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model and ArcGIS. Overall, through analysis on the dynamic and trend of environmental characteristics during the invasion of S. alterniflora and predicting its suitable area in the invasion area, it guides preventing its reintroduction and preventing its further spread of the species has been found. It has reference significance for studying other similar alien plants and essential enlightening relevance to its invasion and spread in similar areas.
