Microsatellite markers for the invasive plant species white sweetclover (Melilotus alba) and yellow sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis)
We describe specific primers that amplify nine microsatellite DNA loci from Melilotus alba and Melilotus officinalis, both invasive plant species (Fabaceae) throughout North America. Allelic diversity was slightly lower for M. alba than for M. officinalis, as was expected heterozygosity. For both species, heterozygote deficit was observed at several loci. Genotypic diversity was very high for both species; the 29 plant samples of each species all had different multilocus genotypes. These markers will be used to determine the origins of the sweetclover invasion in Alaska and to compare patterns of diversity between subarctic and lower latitude populations.
