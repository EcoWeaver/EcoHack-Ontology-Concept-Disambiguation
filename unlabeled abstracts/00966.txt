Functional biogeography of oceanic islands and the scaling of functional diversity in the Azores
Significance Biogeographic theory builds upon a long history of analyzing species-diversity patterns of remote islands, but no previous studies have attempted to investigate corresponding patterns in functional traits on islands. Our analyses of functional diversity (FD) for spiders and beetles in the Azorean archipelago reveal that FD increases with species richness, which, in turn scales with island area regardless of the taxa and distributional group considered (endemics, natives, and exotics). Our results also support the hypothesis that each group contributes to FD in proportion to their species richness and that, being dominant, exotic species have significantly extended the realized trait space of the Azorean islands. Further analyses in other archipelagos are needed to establish whether our findings are representative of oceanic islands.
