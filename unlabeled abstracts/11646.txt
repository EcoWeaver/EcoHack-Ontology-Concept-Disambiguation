Characteristics of soil CO2 efflux under an invasive species, Moso bamboo, in forests of central Taiwan
Key message Soil respiration in a Moso bamboo forest was very sensitive to high temperatures, while ordinary annual soil respiration was comparable to that of other forests. Abstract Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) is expanding aggressively by replacing pre-existing vegetation in areas of East Asia such as Taiwan. Such changes in species composition in forest ecosystems have the potential to alter soil respiration (RS) through changing soil carbon (C) processes. This study aimed to characterize the RS in a Moso bamboo forest by determining temporal variations in RS and estimated annual RS in a pure Moso bamboo stand in central Taiwan. The annual RS in the Moso bamboo stand was also compared with that in adjacent coniferous forests and reports in the literature relative to annual litterfall C. Although distinct diurnal variations in RS were found on days with higher RS and soil temperature (TS), RS measured at a single time between 7:00 and 14:00 h showed considerable concordance with the daily mean RS. Seasonal RS variation reflected variations in TS with minimum values in winter and maximum values in summer. This seasonal dynamic change in RS was predicted by the exponential function (r2 = 0.57) with TS. The Q10 value derived from Moso bamboo forest was 4.09, substantially higher than that in the adjacent forests (Q10 = 1.42-2.16) and the worldwide median (2.0-2.4). The estimated annual RS rate (=1088.69 g C m-2 year-1) relative to annual litterfall C of 202.40 g C m-2 year-1 was marginally different among adjacent coniferous forests and reports from the literature.
