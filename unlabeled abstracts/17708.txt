Re-evaluation of the evidence for the importation of red foxes from Europe to colonial America: Origins of the southeastern red fox (Vulpes vulpes fulva)
It is widely accepted that the red fox subspecies of southeastern North America (Vulpes vulpes fulva) is descended from red foxes imported from Europe to the American colonies for sport hunting. Thus, V. v. fulva is considered an exotic invasive organism that has apparently expanded its range to occupy much of the contiguous United States, with exception of the range of relict native populations in the western mountains and Sacramento Valley. I examined the evidence for importations and found that all claims of introduction stemmed to just two literature sources that were based on vague second-hand information. Together with results of morphological and genetic studies, this information indicates that V. v. fulva is native to North America. Thus, historical shifts in distribution and abundance of V. v. fulva and current management approaches should be re-evaluated in light of native status. Evaluating original sources of information can curtail the proliferation of inaccurate information and conclusions that influence conservation decisions.
