Palaemonidae, Euryrhynchidae, and Sergestidae (Crustacea: Decapoda): records of native species from the states of Amapa and Para, Brazil, with maps of geographic distribution
A list of the distribution records for 18 species of freshwater shrimps of the families Euryrhynchidae (3 spp.), Palaemonidae (13 spp.) and Sergestidae (2 spp.) from the states of Amapa and Para are presented. All records are documented by voucher specimens deposited in the three main carcinological collections from northern Brazil: Instituto de Pesquisas Cientificas e Tecnologicas do Amapa (Macapa), Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia (Manaus), and Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi (Belem). Maps of the geographic distribution of these records in the eastern Amazon region are offered, and comments on the zoogeography of the species are made.
