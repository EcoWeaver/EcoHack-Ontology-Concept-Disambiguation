Fish as Potential Controllers of Invasive Mollusks in a Neotropical Reservoir
We evaluated the importance of the invasive mollusks (Corbicula fluminea and Limnoperna fortunei) in the diets of the fish species through analysis of stomach contents of fish caught in the commercial fishery in the years 2005 and 2006 in the Itaipu Reservoir (Upper Parana River). The degree that these bivalves are processed in the digestive tract was used to identify potential controllers. Food items were evaluated by using the methods of occurrence, volume, and Feeding Index (IAi). Out of the 36 fish species present in the fishery landings, 24 consumed L. fortunei and 12 consumed C. fluminea. In order to evaluate the possibility that the bivalves pass through the digestive tract of the predator without any damage, their degree of digestion was evaluated. Only species with morphological pre-adaptations for a malacophagous diet, or that managed to crush the shells of these bivalves were very successful with this kind of food. In particular, Megalancistrus parananus, Leporinus obtusidens, and Leporinus macrocephalus may be regarded as potential biological control agents for these invasive populations.
