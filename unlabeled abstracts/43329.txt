Influences of plant interspecific competition and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on nitrogen form preference of an invasive plant
Invasive plant species are often able to alter soils in a way that benefits their own fitness over that of native species. While interspecific competitions may drive species to acquire different forms of nitrogen (N) to avoid intensive competition, plant-mycorrhizal interactions can also influence plant nutrient acquisition. Yet, it is unclear whether a variation in N acquisition by an invasive species is driven by interspecific resource partitioning due to competition with native species or by its symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We conducted a pot experiment to examine the effects of competition and fungicide on the uptake of different N forms by Flaveria bidentis, an invasive plant having symbiotic relationships with AM fungi, and two coexisting native species, mycotrophic Bidens maximowicziana and non-mycotrophic Amaranthus retroflexus (referred to by genus hereafter), by growing them either in two-species mixtures or in monocultures. We found that the growth of Flaveria was suppressed by its association with AM fungi regardless of the presence of competing native species, but the degree of suppression was related to the native species with which Flaveria competed. When growing in monocultures, all three species showed a strong preference for NO3--N over NH4+-N and glycine-N regardless of mycorrhizal status. However, under competition conditions, Flaveria increased 15N recovery in any form of N available (in particular NH4+-15N), depending on neighboring plant identity and AM fungi association, whereas Amaranthus specially tended to decrease NH4+-15N uptake when competing with Flaveria, suggesting a niche complementarity in the utilization of N between two species. Our findings suggested that AM fungi may have the potential to limit the invasion of Flaveria, in the short term, and that interspecific competition plays an important role in partitioning soil N acquisition between plant species.
