Coexistence and Competitive Displacement Involving Two Native Ant Species (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)
The invasion of Camponotus laevigatus (F. Smith) nests by Formica haemorrhoidalis Emery is described. The C. laevigatus workers attempt to defend their nest from attack but retreat into the inner galleries of the nest where they are slowly eliminated by the F. haemorrhoidalis workers. Although the invasion of C. laevigatus nests by F. haemorrhoidalis is a common occurrence, the two species coexist. This coexistence may be due to several factors: 1) Camponotus laevigatus is able to disperse greater distances than F. haemorrhoidalis and is therefore able to invade and establish itself in recently disturbed areas several years before the area is invaded by F. haemorrhoidalis. 2) Camponotus laevigatus is able to occupy habitats such as dense woods where F. haemorrhoidalis does not occur. 3) Coexistence may be temporary and C. laevigatus may ultimately be excluded from certain areas. The effect of F. haemorrhoidalis on the C. laevigatus population may not be important; evidence indicates that a C. laevigatus population can increase in an area heavily colonized by F. haemorrhoidalis. It is often assumed that competitive displacement involving native species is rare as an equilibrium between the species has been established in the past. The investigations of Brian, Pontin, Scherba, and that reported here show that displacement involving native ant species may be common, at least in disturbed or artificial situations.
