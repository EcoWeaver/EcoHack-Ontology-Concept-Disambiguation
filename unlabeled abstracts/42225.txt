Research on the Allelophatic Effect Between the Invasive Species Ambrosia Artemisiifolia L. ("Floarea Pustei") and Some Agricultural Crops
The paper presents the results of the allelopathic effect on the germination and growth of plants, immediately after springing, in the interaction between the invasive species Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. (common ragweed) and five crop species: wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), rape (Brassica napus L.) and lucerne (Medicago sativa). The tests consisted in applying treatments with aqueous extracts obtained from young Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. plants, as well as from different vegetative organs harvested from mature plants (roots, leaves and seeds). The results show a highly significant inhibiting effect on the germination of wheat, rye, barley and rape seeds and an insignificant one in lucerne seeds. A strong inhibiting effect upon the growth of plants in early stages of vegetation was established in wheat and rape and a stimulation of growth in the same stage of vegetation in barley and lucerne.
