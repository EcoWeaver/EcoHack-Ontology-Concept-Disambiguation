Race to Displace: A Game to Model the Effects of Invasive Species on Plant Communities
Invasive species are a substantial threat to biodiversity. Educating students about invasive species introduces fundamental concepts in biology, ecology, and environmental science. In the Race to Displace game, students assume the characteristics of select native or introduced plants and experience first hand the influences of species interactions and changing environmental conditions on community composition as they advance across a game board. Through game play, students learn about ways in which species can interact, as well as attributes of successful invaders and the impacts of invasion on communities.
