Retrieving nitrogen isotopic signatures from fresh leaf reflectance spectra: disentangling d(15)N from biochemical and structural leaf properties
Linking remote sensing methodology to stable isotope ecology provides a promising approach to study ecological processes from small to large spatial scales. Here, we show that d1520 N can be detected in fresh leaf reflectance spectra of field samples along a spatial gradient of increasing nitrogen input from an N2-fixing invasive species. However, in field data it is unclear whether d15 N directly influences leaf reflectance spectra or if the relationship is based on covariation between d15N and foliar nitrogen content or other leaf properties. Using a 15N labeling approach, we experimentally varied d15N independently of any other leaf properties in three plant species across different leaf developmental and physiological states. d15N could successfully be modeled by means of partial least squares (PLS) regressions, using leaf reflectance spectra as predictor variables. PLS models explained 53-73% of the variation in d15N within species. Several wavelength regions important for predicting d15 N were consistent across species and could furthermore be related to known absorption features of N-containing molecular bonds. By eliminating covariation with other leaf properties as an explanation for the relationship between reflectance and d15N, our results demonstrate that 15N itself has an inherent effect on leaf reflectance spectra. Thus, our study substantiates the use of spectroscopic measurements to retrieve isotopic signatures for ecological studies and encourages future development. Furthermore, our results highlight the great potential of optical measurements for up-scaling isotope ecology to larger spatial scales.
