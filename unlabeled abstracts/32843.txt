Exotic and invasive fishes in Mexico
This paper presents a list of the exotic fish species introduced in Mexican aquatic systems. This list is the result of the systematized information contained in several databases of ichthyological collections around the world and different publications. A total of 104 species were found, distributed in 19 families and 51 genera. The most species-rich were Cyprinidae with 22 species, Poeciliidae (19 species), Cichlidae (15 species) and Centrarchidae (13 species). A map and an electronic database were created based on the knowledge of the species, showing the known introductions of exotic fishes in the country. The information was obtained from a database stored in the Coleccion Nacional de Peces IBUNAM, which can be accessed online. This study has a high importance for the knowledge of the exotic fish fauna of Mexico and its current status.
