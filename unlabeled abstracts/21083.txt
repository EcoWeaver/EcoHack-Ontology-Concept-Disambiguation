Quantifying risks of volitional consumption of New Zealand Mudsnails by Steelhead and Rainbow Trout
To assess the risk of transferring alien, invasive New Zealand mudsnails (NZMS) Potamopyrgus antipodarum with shipments of live rainbow or steelhead trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, we conducted laboratory trials to quantify and determine the volitional ingestion of snails from the bottom of laboratory tanks. Approximately, 2000 snails were placed on the bottom of a test tank and groups of 10 fish were added to each tank. After 48 h, the fish were removed, euthanized and the snails in the gastrointestinal tract were counted, and the proportion of snails remaining in each tank was measured. We found that both rainbow trout and steelhead consumed NZMS, but rainbow trout consumed nearly twice the number of snails that were consumed by steelhead trout. Feeding fish a maintenance diet increased the total consumption of snails by fish to an average of 64.5 snails per rainbow trout. Our study suggests that management strategies that depurate fish without feed for 48 h to reduce the risk of transfer of NZMS are not viable in preventing the transport of snails if rearing waters contain snails.
