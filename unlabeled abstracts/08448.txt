Alien Invasion: Biology of Philornis Flies Highlighting Philornis downsi, an Introduced Parasite of Galapagos Birds
The muscid genus Philornis comprises approximately 50 described species of flies, nearly all of which are obligate parasites of nestling birds. Philornis species are native to the Neotropics and widely distributed from Florida to Argentina. Most research on this group has focused on P. downsi, which was introduced to the Galapagos Islands in the late twentieth century. Although Philornis parasitism kills nestlings in several native host species, nowhere do the effects seem more severe than in P. downsi in the Galapagos. Here, we review studies of native and introduced Philornis in an attempt to identify factors that may influence virulence and consider implications for the conservation of hosts in the Galapagos.
