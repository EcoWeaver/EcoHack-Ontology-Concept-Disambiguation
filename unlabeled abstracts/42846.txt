Invasive species Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1843) (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Hydrobiidae) in the waterbodies of Kaliningrad region (Russia)
The paper describes the influence of the invasion of the nonindigenous species Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1843) on the mollusk faunas in four waterbodies. It is shown that the list of gastropod mollusks includes 29 species. In all studied waterbodies, P. antipodarum dominates at a high frequency of occurrence, reaching 88%. Within the lake littoral, the mollusk inhabits predominantly sandy, sandy-pebble, and stony grounds; to a lesser extent, it inhabits sandy-plant grounds, allochthonous material, and filamentous algae. In rivers, the mollusks form colonies mostly on macrophytes. As a result of the invasion, the species diversity of mollusk fauna decreases, which may be treated as a biological contamination of the waterbodies.
