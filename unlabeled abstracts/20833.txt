Invasive copepods in the Lower Columbia River Estuary: Seasonal abundance, co-occurrence and potential competition with native copepods
As part of a multi-year field study to investigate plankton dynamics in the Lower Columbia River Estuary (LCRE), we conducted monthly sampling of the mesozooplankton (> 73 mu m) at a station near Astoria, Oregon. The planktonic copepod community was numerically dominated by three non-indigenous species (NIS), Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, Limnoithona tetraspina, and Sinocalanus doerrii, and two native species, Eurytemora affinis and Diacyclops thomasi. However, seasonal co-occurrence of non-indigenous and native copepods was highly variable between species-pairs. The native E. affinis and the non-indigenous S. doerrii showed the greatest temporal overlap (March-October), but other species-pairs also showed periods of considerable overlap during some seasons (e.g., E. affinis and P. forbesi in June-September). Spatial co-occurrence of native and non-indigenous species was also examined in temperature and salinity "space" (rather than geographic space): all six species-pairs (3 non-indigenous species x 2 native species) showed some degree of overlap, with the greatest (proportional) overlap occurring between the native E. affinis and the two non-indigenous species, S. doerrii and P. forbesi. This suggests the potential for competition to occur between native and non-native copepods in the LCRE, although with variation between seasons and species. Future studies are recommended that explicitly test for and distinguish between the relative importance of biological (e.g., competition and predation) and physico-chemical processes (e.g., freshwater runoff, eutrophication) in regulating the population dynamics of native and invasive copepods in the LCRE.
