The effect of elevated temperature on spawning of introduced pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus in Europe
In an experimental comparison of pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus reproduction under ambient and climate change water temperature regimes, spawning occurred earlier in the season, which is likely to lead to greater young-of-the-year survival with concomitant implications in the U.K. under warmer climatic conditions.
