Effects of water hyacinth invasion on the health of the communities, and the education of children along River Tano and Abby-Tano Lagoon in Ghana
The invasion of water bodies by water hyacinth has been highlighted to be a source of problem to riparian communities. They are known to reduce the velocity of water bodies, thereby serving as suitable breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Their obstruction to water transportation also means students who cross invaded water bodies to school will have their education negatively affected. Based on cross-sectional research with 305 respondents who were sampled using snowballing sampling procedure, this study assesses the effects of water hyacinth invasion on the health of the communities, and the education of children along River Tano and Abby-Tano Lagoon in Ghana. We found that the invasion of water hyacinth in the two water bodies was associated with malaria infestation and other health hazards. The blockade created by water hyacinth also meant students delayed in their quest to access their schools, while others absented themselves from classes. However, respondents mainly used insecticide-treated nets to cope with the spread of the mosquitoes that bred in the water hyacinth while parents made provision for their wards to stay outside the affected village across the River Tano in order to attend classes in the peak season of the invasion.
