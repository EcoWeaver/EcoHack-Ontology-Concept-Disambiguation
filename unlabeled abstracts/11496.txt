Ski slope vegetation in central Honshu, Japan
To determine the status of the vegetation of ski slopes in northeastern-central Honshu, Japan, 94 plots (2x2 m) were set up on five ski areas (101-520 m elevation) which were established between 1945 and 1985 by forest clear-cutting, land modification, and seeding. Six vegetation types were recognized: five grasslands dominated byDigitaria adscendens, Miscanthus sinensis, Zoysia japonica, Festuca rubra, andPteridium aquilinum var.latiusculum, respectively, and bare areas of very low to no vegetation cover. Of the dominant species,F. rubra is the only introduced species; it does not, however, appear to persist. After the introduced grassland declinesM. sinensis or annual grasslands develop. Native plants, especially woody species, can establish inM. sinensis grassland but do not establish in the other grasslands. It is concluded that the introduction of exotic species is inappropriate to maintain ski slope vegetation, and the development ofM. sinensis grassland is desirable to promote natural revegetation.
