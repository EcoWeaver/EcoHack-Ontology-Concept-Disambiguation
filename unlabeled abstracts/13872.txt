Genetic diversity and connectivity patterns of harvested and aquacultured molluscs in estuaries from Asturias (northern Spain). Implications for management strategies
Estuaries are among the most important habitats of coastal areas. However, they are significantly affected by human activities worldwide, threatening their resources and the commercial uses depending on them. Fisheries and aquaculture are some of the main factors affecting the estuarine ecosystems today. In this work, we pursue the aims of genetically identifying the cultured and harvested oyster and razor clam species inhabiting Asturian estuaries (Eo, Ribadesella and Villaviciosa) and describing the genetic diversity and patterns of genetic connectivity between those species in these estuaries. The results revealed the almost complete dominance of the introduced Crassostrea gigas as the species that supports the oyster's production in Asturias with a striking diversity of gene pools in wild environments (Ria de Villaviciosa and Ribadesella) which significantly exceeds the diversity found in the hatcheries seeds commonly used for culturing. Moreover, we detected two different species of Ensis sp. inhabiting the Asturian estuaries: Ensis ensis inside Ria del Eo and Ensis directus, an invasive species, in Ria de Villaviciosa. Significant genetic differentiation between estuaries for the exotic oyster C. gigas and also for the native razor clam Solen marginatus were found. These results suggest Asturian estuaries are not a single management unit for some species and thus prevention must be taken for avoiding intentional or human-mediated translocations among them. Biodiversity monitoring for discovering newcomer invasive species, measures for environmental recovery of these ecosystems and strict controls to avoid increasing of harvesting pressures are also a necessity to improve the management of these relevant ecosystems.
