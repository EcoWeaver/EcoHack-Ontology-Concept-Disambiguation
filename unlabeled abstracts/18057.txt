Zooplankton production in the Bay of Quinte 1975-2008: relationships with primary production, habitat, planktivory, and aquatic invasive species (Dreissena spp. andCercopagis pengoi)
The Bay of Quinte, a long, shallow, high-phosphorus system in Lake Ontario, spans a trophic range from eutrophic (upper Bay) to meso-oligotrophic (mouth). Phosphorus control (PC) and the invasion of dreissenid mussels and Cercopagis pengoi have influenced its biology and environment. We elucidated the principal drivers behind zooplankton production in the Bay from pre-PC times to the present (1975-2008). Production of abundant species was calculated using the egg-ratio method. Production estimates were improved by determining system-specific production/biomass (P/B) relationships for rarer species. Planktivory governed zooplankton production initially, likely preventing a response to PC. With changes in the fish community, zooplankton production increased. Thereafter, the principal drivers were the structure and size of the fish community, shifts in the predatory arena associated with changing light penetration, temperature, and addition of C. pengoi -- all within a general context of nutrient availability. Dreissenid impacts were indirect. Interactive variables combining measures of predation, nutrient level, light, and temperature were the best at accounting for variability in zooplankton production.
