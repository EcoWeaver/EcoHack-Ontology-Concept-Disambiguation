When Invasive Species have Benefits as well as Costs: Managing Carex kobomugi (Asiatic sand sedge) in New Jersey's Coastal Dunes
Asiatic sand sedge, Carex kobomugi,was accidentally introduced into North America approximately a century ago and is now widespread along the Northeast coast of the USA. This paper documents the rapid spread rate of this species in two New Jersey coastal parks. Also documented are declines in native plant densities, species richness and diversity in invaded areas. Although C. kobomugi expansion is having negative ecological impacts, the species is a potentially important dune stabilizer, so its control or removal demands special care. A removal program was initiated in 1999, using carefully directed applications of Roundup(r), which was designed such that it would spare non-target plants, leaving them in place to hold the dunes. We show that this approach reduced, but did not eliminate, C. kobomugi, even after repeated herbicide application. Native plant stem densities, species richness and species diversity in treated and untreated stands were similar, suggesting that this application technique did effectively spare non-target plants. However, effective eradication of C. kobomugi would probably require more frequent and aggressive broadband herbicide application, precluding beneficial effects of localized treatment (both ecological and increased dune stability due to spared plants).
