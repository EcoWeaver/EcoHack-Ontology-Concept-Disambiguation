Developing cost-effective early detection networks for regional invasions
Early detection and rapid response (EDRR) seek to control or eradicate new invasions to prevent their spread, but effective EDRR remains elusive due to financial and managerial constraints. As part of the Great Lakes Early Detection Network, we asked stakeholders to indicate their needs for an effective EDRR communication tool. Our results led to the development of a website with five primary features: (1) the ability for casual observers to report a sighting; (2) a network of professionals to verify new sightings; (3) email alerts of new sightings, including data from all data providers across the region; (4) maps of species distributions across data providers; and (5) easy communication channels among stakeholders. Using results from our stakeholder discussions, we provide a cost-effective framework for online EDRR networks that integrate data and develop social capital through a virtual community. This framework seeks to provide real-time data on current species distributions and improve across jurisdictional collaboration with limited oversight.
