Red alga Grateloupia imbricata (Halymeniaceae), a species introduced into the Canary Islands
Specimens of Grateloupia from Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands were used to molecularly ascertain which of the species has been used in physiological and bio-technological experiments. The rbcL sequence analysis revealed that four out of five analyzed specimens (i.e. those commonly collected for physiological research) formed a monophyletic clade with G. imbricata from Korea, Japan, and China, and were quite different from any other species of the genus. Another sample, which was associated with cage nets used for fish aquaculture, was grouped with G. lanceolata from Japan, though it appears too early as yet to identify it as such. This is, thus, proof of a new introduction of a marine macroalga, since G. imbricata is an Asian species, native to Japan and Korea, in the Canary Islands. The role of international shipping in the introduction of the species is discussed.
