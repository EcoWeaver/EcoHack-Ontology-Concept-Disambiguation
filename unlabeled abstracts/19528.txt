Differences in photosynthetic capacity, chlorophyll fluorescence, and antioxidant system between invasive Alnus formosana and its native congener in response to different irradiance levels
We compared the invasive Alnus formosana with its native congener (A. cremastogyne) at three irradiances in terms of photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence and antioxidant system. The increased light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Amax) and light saturation point (LSP) contributed directly to the increased performance of the invasive. The invasive species had also higher plasticity in carotenoid and total chlorophyll than the native species at 100% irradiance, potentially contributing to invasion success in high-irradiance locations via photoprotection. Moreover, the diurnal photoinhibition of photosynthesis, as judged by the maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) of dark-adapted leaves, was more severe in the natives than in the invasive. With increasing irradiance, the invasive exhibited increased antioxidant activities and higher antioxidant levels to support the adverse conditions of both low- and high-irradiance acclimation. In contrast, the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) and stomatal limitation (Ls) decreased with increases in the net photosynthetic rate (An), stomatal conductance (Gs), and transpiration rate (Tr). We speculated that Ls was the main factor inhibiting the An for both studied species. These results first indicated that the invasive may occupy new habitats successfully through tolerating shading at low irradiance and out-compete native species through higher Amax and antioxidant levels when irradiance is increased.
