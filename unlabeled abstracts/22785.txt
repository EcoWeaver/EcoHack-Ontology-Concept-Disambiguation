Review of risk assessment systems of IAS in Europe and introducing the German-Austrian Black List Information System (GABLIS)
We give a mini-review of existing European risk assessment procedures and present a newly developed and tested risk assessment tool for invasive alien species (IAS) in Germany and Austria, the "German-Austrian Black List Information System" (GABLIS). Based on the analysis of existing European national risk assessment systems, we analyse and discuss: the assessment criteria used; which impacts of IAS (biodiversity, economy) have been considered; for which taxonomic groups has the assessment been designed and tested; how many and which list categories have been used; and, the status of the assessment, i.e. legally binding or advisory. We found that the application of risk assessment systems in Europe started belatedly, however recently a considerable number of assessment systems have been developed and tested. These systems encompass a wide range of purposes and approaches, and so far, no common standard on the aspects mentioned above has been emerged.
