Relationship between Exotic Invasive Shrubs and American Woodcock (Scolopax minor) Nest Success and Habitat Selection
Habitat loss is thought to be a cause of woodcock population declines, however little is known about the impact of exotic invasive vegetation on woodcock nest site selection and nesting success. In March and April of 2009 and 2010, we examined nest success and nesting habitat selection in relation to the abundance of exotic invasive vegetation at 13 nests in southeastern Pennsylvania. We used logistic regression and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to determine the best models for nest success and habitat use. Woodcock avoided exotic invasive vegetation when selecting nest sites. Nest success and habitat use decreased significantly with an increase in percentage of exotic invasive woody vegetation. Models containing percentage of exotic invasive woody vegetation were highly supported for nest success and habitat selection. We recommend that managers attempt to control and remove exotic invasive vegetation to promote increased woodcock nesting success and habitat use.
