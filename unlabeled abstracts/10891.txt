The spread of Caulerpa cylindracea in Calabria (Italy) and the effects of shipping activities
A survey to state the spread of Caulerpa cylindracea in the Calabrian Tyrrhenian coasts has been un-dertaken. The research aims to value the role of shipping activities in the ten-year's study from 1999 to 2009, as a vector in the spreading of the species. The outcome of this study has shown that, during the last ten years, the species has colonized most of the regional coastline, on all kinds of substrata, in areas closed to harbours and subjected to high rate of sedimentation. The main effects of Caulerpa cylindracea colonization have resulted in a gradual decrease of crustose species while the turf ones have increased their abundance, altering the native structure of the macroalgal assemblages. These results confirm the extremely invasive behaviour of this strain in the Calabrian Tyrrhenian coasts and, more generally, in the Mediterranean Sea.
