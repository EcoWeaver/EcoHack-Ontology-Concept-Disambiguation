Alien plants in Norway and dynamics in the flora: a review
The number of alien plants with stable populations in Norway is 593 (22.5% of the total registered flora). An additional 595 taxa (22.6%) occur (or occurred) sporadically. About 110 taxa are known to be spreading. About 20 additional taxa have been found repeatedly during recent decades but will probably not spread under the present climatic conditions. Alien plants are introduced via shipping, roads and railways, seeds for grass and other forage crops, for road verges and lawns, grain and soya import, and forestry. Gardening is responsible for about 45% of the spreading taxa, comprising those which spread most rapidly. Regional variations in the number of alien plants are demonstrated by comparing the flora of four counties and two municipalities. The majority of alien plants are found in disturbed sites. Rural, urban and industrial development, road building and other encroachments offer ample opportunities for alien plants to spread. Some taxa might endanger native ones, especially less competitive taxa growing in slightly disturbed sites. Most of the alien taxa being introduced are widely distributed weeds or plants which are commonly cultivated in North and Central Europe. A 'convergence' between the flora of Norway and other countries, and a relative loss in regional specificity, are to be expected.
