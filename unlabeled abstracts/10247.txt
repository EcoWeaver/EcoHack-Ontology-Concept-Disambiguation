Space invaders: effects of invasive alien Pallas's squirrel on home range and body mass of native red squirrel
Alien species can affect native species through several ecological processes such as competition. Here we tested the hypothesis of interspecific competition for space and food resources between the native Eurasian red squirrel and the invasive Pallas's squirrel introduced in Italy. We used an experimental study design comparing space and habitat use and body condition parameters of red squirrels between areas of co-occurrence with the Pallas's squirrel and areas without it. There were no differences in mean home range size of red squirrels between red-only areas and red-Pallas. However, when Pallas's squirrels were removed, the red squirrels increased their home ranges. Moreover, in the area of syntopy, red squirrels had a higher degree of intraspecific home range overlap than in the red-only area. We also found indirect evidence for competition for food with red squirrels having a poorer body condition when co-occurring with the alien species. We analyzed the body mass and size of red squirrels in the two areas and our results showed that red squirrels had a reduced body mass and size when in syntopy, confirming that the interspecific competition does not allow red squirrels to reach the optimum body condition that they would have if the competitor was not present. Moreover, tree-species niche overlap was very high and both species fed primarily on the same tree seeds. Differences in vegetation cover between areas are discussed. This is the first study that confirms the invasiveness of the Pallas's squirrel also in terms of capability to compete with native species.
