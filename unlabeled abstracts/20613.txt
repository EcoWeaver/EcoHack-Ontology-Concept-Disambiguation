Local extinction and colonisation in native and exotic fish in relation to changes in land use
Distribution patterns of many native and exotic fish species are well documented, yet little is known about the temporal dynamics of native and exotic diversity in relation to changes in land use. We hypothesised that colonisation rates would be higher for exotic fish species and that extinction rates would be higher for native species in large stream systems. We also predicted that cold-water species would be more impacted than thermally tolerant species. To test these hypotheses, we used generalised linear mixed models to compare changes in native and exotic fish species richness over 10 years in a French drainage basin subjected to landscape alterations. Exotic fish were more susceptible to local extinction than the native ones. Extinction was greater among cold-tolerant species and at higher elevations. Colonisation by exotic species was higher at lower elevations. Although a decade of expanding urbanisation affected fish colonisation, agricultural lands experienced higher extinction rates. In the context of global changes in land use and population pressure, our study suggests that the temporal dynamics of fish diversity are driven by landscape alterations as well as by the thermal tolerance of species.
