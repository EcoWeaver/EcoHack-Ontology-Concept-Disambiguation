Characterization of bacterial communities associated with the exotic and heavy metal tolerant wetland plant Spartina alterniflora
Heavy metal pollution has seriously disrupted eco-balance and transformed estuaries into sewage depots. Quanzhou bay is a typical heavy metal-contaminated estuary, in which Spartina alterniflora has widely invaded. Plant-associated microbial communities are crucial for biogeochemical cycles, studies of which would be helpful to demonstrate the invasion mechanisms of plants. Meanwhile, they are indispensable to phytoremediation by enhancing the heavy metal tolerance of plants, facilitating heavy metal absorption rate and promoting growth of plants. In the present study, S. alterniflora-associated rhizo- and endobacterial communities from 3 experimental sites were investigated by 454-pyrosequencing. Heavy metal screening generated 16 culturable isolates, further biochemical assays suggested these clones possess various abilities such as phosphate solubilization, Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase production to accelerate heavy metal uptake and growth of the host. This study revealed the bacterial community structures and characterized the predominant resident bacterial strains of S. alterniflora-associated rhizo- and endobacteria under heavy metal stress, and isolated several bacterial species with potential ecological function.
