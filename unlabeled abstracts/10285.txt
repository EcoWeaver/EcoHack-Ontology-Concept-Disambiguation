Efficacy of micafungin for the treatment of invasive candidiasis and candidaemia in patients with neutropenia.
Background: Neutropenia is linked to development of invasive candidiasis/candidaemia, for which micafungin has demonstrated efficacy, but evidence in patients with neutropenia is limited. Objectives: Evaluate efficacy of micafungin for treatment of invasive candidiasis/candidaemia in patients with neutropenia (<500 neutrophils/mL) and without neutropenia. Methods: This pooled, post hoc analysis of two Phase 3 trials compared micafungin 100mg/day (adults) and 2mg/kg/day (paediatrics) with L-AmB 3mg/kg/day (NCT00106288) and micafungin 100mg/day and 150mg/day with caspofungin 70mg/day followed by 50mg/day (adults) (NCT00105144); treatment duration 2-4 weeks (<=8 weeks for chronic disseminated candidiasis). Effects of neutropenia duration and Candida spp. on efficacy outcomes (treatment success, clinical and mycological response) were examined. Results: Of 685 patients, 77 had neutropenia. The most common infection in patients with/without neutropenia was due to C. tropicalis (31/77) and C. albicans (295/608), respectively. Overall success was numerically lower in patients with vs. without neutropenia (63.6% vs. 72.9%). Clinical and mycological response was similar between groups. Neutropenia duration or Candida spp. did not impact micafungin's overall success rate. Conclusions: This analysis supports evidence that micafungin is effective against invasive candidiasis/candidaemia in patients with neutropenia, irrespective of neutropenia duration or Candida spp., although overall success may be lower than in patients without neutropenia.
