Inverted invasions: Native plants can frequently colonise urban and highly disturbed habitats
There is an enormous body of literature on plant invasions, including many investigations of the types of introduced species that are most likely to invade natural ecosystems. In this study we turn invasion biology upside down, and ask what sort of native species colonise novel anthropogenic habitats such as roadside lawns, infrequently tended road shoulders, railway embankments and fire trails. We quantified species richness and cover in roadside lawns and infrequently tended road shoulders in five regions of New South Wales, Australia. The native vegetation in these regions included sclerophyll forest, fertile and infertile Eucalypt-dominated woodlands, rainforest, and semi-arid woodland. We performed a complementary survey of sites spanning five disturbance levels within the region containing sclerophyll forest vegetation. Although many non-native species were present in disturbed, novel habitats, a total of 136 native species were also found. Most of these native species were in sites with low levels of disturbance (fire trails and railway embankments), but 35 native species were found to colonise roadside lawns, our most highly-disturbed vegetation type. There was a significant negative relationship between the disturbance level in novel habitats and the number and cover of native species. Native species that colonised novel habitats were disproportionately likely be generalist species whose natural habitat includes both high and low light and high and low disturbance conditions. The native species colonising novel habitats also tended to have traits associated with a fast life-history, including short stature and small seeds. A surprisingly high number of native plant species are colonising novel, anthropogenic habitats. Our findings highlight the potential importance of urban ecosystems for conservation and restoration biology.
