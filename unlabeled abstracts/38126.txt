Mitochondrial Polymorphism of Native and Invasive Populations of Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae)
Ladybird Harmonia axyridis is a widespread polyphage and forms stable populations in East Asia and spreading invasive populations in Europe and other regions with temperate and subtropical climate. A characteristic of haplotype diversity of native and invasive populations of H. axyridis at the atp6 gene is given. The characteristic differences in the composition and quantitative ratio of mitochondrial haplotypes between the western and eastern groups of populations of the native range are revealed. The genetic structure of invasive populations is uniform across the whole range in Europe, from the Atlantic coast to the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus, which is indicative of the spread of H. axyridis invasive populations in Europe from one center. In Europe, the mitochondrial gene pool of invasive populations is formed by two major haplotypes. This mitochondrial haplotype composition remains unchanged in the process of the invasion expansion. The possible role of mixed origin of invasive populations of H. axyridis in the formation of the invasive ability is discussed.
