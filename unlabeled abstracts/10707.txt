Planktonic bloom of an introduced species of Polysiphonia (Ceramiales, Rhodophyta) along the coast of North Carolina, USA
Polysiphonia breviarticulata, a species previously known only from the Adriatic, the Mediterranean, and the Canary Islands, is reported for the first time from the Western Atlantic in Dominica and North Carolina. In the latter region it has grown in bloom quantities as drifting, planktonic plants that are a nuisance on beaches and a serious impediment to fishermen whose nets become fouled with the plants.
