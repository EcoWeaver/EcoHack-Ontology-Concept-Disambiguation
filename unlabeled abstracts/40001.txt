Calcite as a candidate for non-invasive phosphorus removal from lakes
Calcite (Cc) has been tested as a potential phosphorus (P) binding agent to be used for non-invasive P removal from lakes. In this approach P binding agent is placed in the water column and subsequently removed together with the sorbed P. Mechanism of orthophosphate (OP) sorption onto (Cc) and Cc behaviour were investigated under epilimnetic and hypolimnetic temperature, pH and saturation with respect to Cc (25degC, pH = 9.0, saturation index for Cc (SICc) = 1.4, and 10degC, pH = 7.1, SICc = -0.7, respectively) at initial OP of ~ 1 mg PO43- L-1 and range of Cc dosages (0.01-20.1 g L-1) resulting in OP:Cc mass ratio of 0.05-85 (mg:g). Prevailing binding processes were adsorption and precipitation, depending on OP:Cc mass ratio (adsorption predominated at low OP:Cc and precipitation at high OP:Cc). Under epilimnetic conditions, approximately five times lower OP:Cc mass ratio was needed to induce precipitation as compared to hypolimnion, indicating at a greater probability of precipitation in epilimnion while adsorption was more likely to occur in hypolimnion. In epilimnion, co-precipitation of OP was also involved together with sole adsorption. Calculated maximum adsorption was 35% higher in epilimnion, whereas obtained precipitation rates (measured as unit sorption) were 87% higher, showing promoting effect of epilimnetic conditions on OP removal. Application of Cc into epilimnion will result in pH drop which can reduce occurrence of cyanobacteria. Application of Cc into hypolimnion will result in its partial dissolution, while most of the applied Cc mass will be removable after the finished treatment.
