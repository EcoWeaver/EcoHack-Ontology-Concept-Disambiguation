Geographical differences in competitive hierarchy in a native-invasive system
Abstract Biological invasions can create novel competitive interactions and force ecological shifts in both native and invasive species. Anuran tadpoles are able to modify their behaviour, morphology, growth and development to cope with competitive pressure. This plasticity is a good target for natural selection and can drive rapid evolutionary changes in response to novel interactions. Here, we explore changes in plastic responses and fitness of competing invasive and native tadpoles by exposing tadpoles from different locations with contrasting evolutionary histories to the same set of varied competitive conditions. Eggs were collected from one site near the first introduction of the invasive frog (~110 years of coexistence) and from a second site that was invaded recently. We hypothesized less favourable outcomes for the invasive species in long-coexisting populations, where the native competitor might have developed adaptive responses. Most results support the hypothesis. Where the invasion was older, invasive tadpoles exposed to native competitors grew less, developed more slowly and displayed morphologies linked to competitive stress, whereas the developmental stability and canalization of native tadpoles increased. On the whole, the asymmetric competitive relationship thus appeared to approach symmetry after ~35 generations, highlighting a noteworthy example of rapid adaptation after an invasion.
