Human Foot Traffic and the Associated Spread of Invasive Species
The spread of invasive species has become an important topic in ecological literature in recent years as it threatens the natural biodiversity essential for ecosystems to function and thrive. Invasive species are damaging to ecosystems because they outcompete native species for invaluable resources. Human activities have long been suspected of being the main vector for the transportation of invasive species due to the attachment of seeds to objects such as clothing, shoes, livestock, and vehicles. Gaining an understanding of the interactions between human activity and invasive species spread is crucial to diminish the negative impact of invasive species on local ecosystems. In our research endeavor, we investigated human foot traffic in urban parks and conservation areas and surveyed the surrounding area for invasive plant species. In several different parks, we set up plots with varying levels of human foot traffic and designated each as low, medium, and high foot traffic. We measured each of the plants within the plots, denoting each as invasive or non-invasive. We also measured observed foot traffic to confirm the accuracy of the designated foot traffic levels and to create a traffic gradient. We found a general correlation between high foot traffic and abundant invasive species, which supports our hypothesis. It is important to note that there remains many other factors that influence invasive species' spread that should be investigated. Further research should be conducted on the mechanisms behind this spread and how it can be reduced.
