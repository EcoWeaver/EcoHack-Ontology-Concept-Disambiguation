Abundance and pest classification of scolytid species (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) follow different patterns
Scolytids have been studied more than any other group of forest insects, but most investigations have been restricted to only a few pest species. This bias hampers our understanding of variation in abundance and pest status. Even the simple question whether the abundance of scolytids can predicted by the same independent variables as their pest status is still a matter of debate. To explore this issue, we estimated their abundance using non-attracting flight-interception traps set in a wide range of forests across Czech Republic, Germany, and France. Pest status was taken from current literature. As independent variables, we considered host range, host abundance, and several traits of the considered species in linear models using generalized least squares with a correlation structure derived from the phylogenetic tree of the beetles. Host range was calculated as the root phylogenetic diversity index. The variation in the abundance across scolytids was well explained by resource-related parameters (R2=0.53). In contrast to abundance, the pest status was significantly related to species-specific traits, such as body size and maximum number of generations. However, the explained variance was much lower (R2=0.19). Although our analysis showed that abundance and pest score follow different patterns, we stress the importance of monitoring all species using non-selective traps. Considering the increasing global trade and the rapidly changing climate, such a broad ecological monitoring is necessary to detect new interactions and/or invading species that may influence our forests ecosystems.
