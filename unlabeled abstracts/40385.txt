An intra-continental invasion of the temperate freshwater copepod Skistodiaptomus pallidus (Herrick, 1879) (Calanoida, Diaptomidae) in tropical Mexico
The freshwater planktonic calanoid copepod Skistodiaptomus pallidus (Herrick, 1879), native to cold and temperate latitudes in the United States, has recently been identified as having non-indigenous populations in Western Europe and New Zealand. A further non-indigenous population of this species is recorded here from a large inland reservoir in the State of Sinaloa, northwestern Mexico. This copepod species can be distinguished from its congeners mainly by its pincer-like distal process of the second exopodal segment of the right fifth leg of the male. This is the first record of S. pallidus in tropical latitudes and its presence in Mexico is far outside of its known intra-continental range. This introduction is attributed to human agency and deemed as a recent arrival. The local fisheries and aquaculture activities in the surveyed reservoir are the most probable vectors of this introduction but avian transportation by migrating pelicans is also possible. Because of the competitive abilities of this species and the connectivity of this reservoir, it is expected that S. pallidus will spread to other man-made locations in Mexico.
