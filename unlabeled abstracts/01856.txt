Little association of biological trait values with environmental variables in invasive alien round goby (Neogobius melanostomus).
The relative importance of species-specific biological trait characteristics and environmental factors in invasions of nonindigenous species remains controversial because both have mostly been studied independently. Thus, the main objective of this study was to examine the correlation of biological traits with environmental variation in the globally invasive round goby Neogobius melanostomus from the upper Danube River. Based on a sample of 653 specimens along a continuous 200 km river pathway, links between nine environmental factors (substrate-type, six water measurements, and the communities of fishes and macroinvertebrates) and seven biological traits (nutritional and energetic status, trade-offs of parasite resistance and resource allocation, and three growth proxies) were analyzed. Biological trait values of N. melanostomus hardly correlated with the environment, could not explain invasion progress and imply a general low overall importance for invasion success. Instead, alternative individual life-history trajectories appear to determine invasion success. This is in line with up to 15% of all specimens having outlying biological trait values of potential adaptive value, suggesting a considerable importance of adaptive trait variation among single individuals for the whole invasion progress. This "individual trait utility hypothesis" gives an alternative explanation for success of invasive species by single individuals carrying particular traits, and it should be specifically targeted and analyzed at currently invaded sites.
