Evidence for 2.0 Ga continental microbial mats in a paleodesert setting
Early evolved microbial communities characterized the initial biological invasion of Precambrian continental landscapes. In modern arid settings, microbial mats and biological soil crusts are well-developed and stabilize sediment. The Paleoproterozoic Makgabeng Formation in South Africa is one of the oldest and best preserved, dryland systems on Earth. Six types of microbial mat-related structures are now recognized within these depositional systems. This paper presents three newly discovered structures that include tufted microbial mat, biological soil crusts, and gas-escape features, in addition to three previously documented structures that include roll up features, sand cracks, and wrinkled features. These discoveries demonstrate that microbial communities were well-established and inhabited diverse continental settings by 2.0 Ga, approximately 200 million years after the onset of the Great Oxidation Event.
