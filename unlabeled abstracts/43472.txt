Pseudodactylogyrus anguillae (Yin &amp; Sproston, 1948) from the giant mottled eel Anguilla marmorata Quoy &amp; Gaimard, 1824, in the Phongolo River, South Africa: an invader on the African continent
The global invasive anguillid gill parasite Pseudodactylogyrus anguillae (Yin and Sproston, 1948) has only recently been documented from eels in South Africa. As there is no known eel trade in South Africa, the source of introduction of this parasite has been debated, and its status as an alien parasite was rendered uncertain. We report on the first infection of Pseudodactylogyrus anguillae from the giant mottled eel Anguilla marmorata from the Phongolo River (South Africa) using classic morphological and molecular methodologies and clarify the introduction status category of this parasite as alien and invasive.
