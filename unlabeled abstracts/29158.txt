Clarifying the identity of the long-established, globally-invasive Physa acuta Draparnaud, 1805 (Gastropoda: Physidae) in Singapore
The freshwater snail identified as Physastra sumatrana has been recorded in Singapore since the late 1980's. It is distributed throughout the island and commonly associated with ornamental aquatic plants. Although the species has previously been considered by some to be native to Singapore, its origin is currently categorised as unknown. Morphological comparisons of freshly collected specimens and material in museum collections with type material, together with DNA barcoding, show that both Physastra sumatrana, and a recent gastropod record of Stenophysa spathidophallus, in Singapore are actually the same species--the globally-invasive Physa acuta. An unidentified physid snail was also collected from the Singapore aquarium trade.
