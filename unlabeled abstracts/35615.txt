Escapees of potentially invasive fishes from an ornamental aquaculture facility: the case of topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva
Accidental escapees from aquacultural facilities are an ongoing problem facing scientists, conservationists, policy makers and naturalists throughout the world. The topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva, a small cyprinid native to Southeast Asia, was introduced to Romanian waters in 1960 via the aquaculture trade and has since spread throughout Europe. It first appeared in England in an ornamental fish farm near Romsey in Hampshire. The aim of the present study was to quantify the dispersal of this potentially highly invasive species from an ornamental fish farm into the wild. In order to measure the dispersal of escapees, intensive electrofishing surveys were carried out between June and September 2003 in the catchment downstream of the fish farm. The distribution of topmouth gudgeon in the catchment was found to be limited and patchy. The presence of small individuals suggests that the species has successfully established itself in the wild, but this remains to be confirmed. The results were examined in light of invasion theory principles of biological resistance and ecological fitness.
