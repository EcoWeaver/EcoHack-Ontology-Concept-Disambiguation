The Impact of Exotic Dune Grass Species on Foredune Development in Australia and New Zealand: a case study ofAmmophila arenariaandThinopyrum junceiforme
Marram grass (Ammophila arenaria) and sea-wheat grass (Thinopyrum junceiforme) have been introduced to Australia and New Zealand. This study examines the morphology of incipient foredunes and established foredunes associated with these species at two sites, Mason Bay in southern New Zealand, and the Younghusband Peninsula in South Australia. Both species invaded the existing foredunes very rapidly. In both cases the antecedent topography comprised relatively sparsely vegetated, irregular foredunes. Invasion resulted in continuous, regular, evenly vegetated foredunes. At Mason Bay a massive foredune has formed since 1958, in conjunction with Ammophila. Thinopyrum has formed an incipient foredune, with a ramp or terrace morphology, along the Younghusband Peninsula, South Australia. In both cases gaps in the former foredune have been closed and the indigenous foredune vegetation has been displaced. Both species may decrease the frequency and severity of blowout development. They are likely to be resilient to aeolian processes of sedimentation compared with dunes formed by indigenous species. Ammophila survives burial, is tolerant of drought and is resistant to erosion associated with storm surge and high waves. Thinopyrum is very tolerant of salinity. These species may adversely affect the long-term development of coastal barriers by inhibiting transgressive dune development.
