Haemaphysalis (Kaiseriana) bispinosa Neumann (Ixodoidea: Ixodidae): Evidence for Consideration as an Introduced Species in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo
In much of India and neighboring nations, Haemaphysalis (K.) bispinosa parasitizes wild and domestic Carnivora and Artiodactyla alike. However, in the Malay Peninsula, where 12,030 ticks were collected from 459 wild Carnivora and Artiodactyla and 5,555 ticks were taken from 388 domestic animals, H. (K.) bispinosa was represented by 34 (0.28%) specimens from the wild hosts and by 4,907 (88.33%) specimens from the domestic hosts. Although widely distributed in the Malay Peninsula, this parasite has biological characteristics of an introduced species that has not adapted to the Malayan forest environment and fauna. Several old specimens of bispinosa from Borneo [British Museum (Natural History) collections] may represent erroneous labeling or samples of introduced ticks that do not appear to have established a permanent population on this island.
