Spatial Subtidal Macrobenthic Distribution in Relation to Abiotic Conditions in the Lima Estuary, NW of Portugal
During the summer of 2002, sampling was carried out in the Lima estuary in order to compare the pattern of the macrobenthic community's distribution in relation to physical and chemical variables. A total of 54 macrobenthic taxa were identified. Abundance, biomass and specific diversity varied among the twenty stations. Abundance ranged from 212 to 9856ind./m2, with an average of 1581ind./m2. Abra alba presented the highest density corresponding to 39.1% of the total specimens gathered, followed by Hediste diversicolor with 31.5%. Biomass ranged from 0.12 to 264.62g AFDW/m2, with an average of 17.58g AFDW/m2. Cerastoderma edule and A. alba were the species with a clear predominance in the total biomass, contributing 75.3 and 13.8%, respectively. The multivariate techniques used revealed a macrobenthic community with five distinct groups, particularly related to the sedimentological characteristics and salinity. These results demonstrated significant differences in macrobenthic assemblage's composition along an estuarine gradient. For the first time the presence of the nonindigenous invasive species Corbicula fluminea was described in this estuary.
