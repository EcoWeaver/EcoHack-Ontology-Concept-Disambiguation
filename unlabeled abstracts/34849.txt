On Darwin's Steps: Citizen Science Can Help Keep an Eye on Alien Species
Citizens around the world can act like scientists by providing important information about biodiversity that can help scientists' research. The same applies to species that expand from their areas of origin to other places, often creating problems for the native species. Nowadays, there are plenty of projects that involve citizen scientists in the monitoring of alien species and biodiversity. The European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN) of the European Commission gathers data from several projects and has developed its own app that enables people to report observations of invasive alien species. So, are you ready to become a citizen scientist?
