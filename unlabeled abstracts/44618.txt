Review of harvest incentives to control invasive species
From nutria to lionfish, recent interest has grown in ways to encourage the harvest and use species as a means of controlling or eradicating invasive populations. If used properly, incentivizing and encouraging public or commercial harvest represents a significant opportunity to support ecosystem and natural resource management while simultaneously boosting economic development and environmental awareness. However, if used incorrectly, negative consequences such as further spread can occur. Success depends on interactions between the species, its invasive range, and socioeconomic factors, yet little guidance is available on how to use incentivized harvest as an effective management tool. This paper reviews the biological, ecological, human health, and socioeconomic factors involved in invasive species incentive programs. We also offer recommendations to assist in development and implementation of a successful harvest program.
