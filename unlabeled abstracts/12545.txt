A Proposal for the Feasible Exploitation of the Red Swamp CrayfishProcambarus Clarkiiin Introduced Regions
The invasive red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii is a human-mediated introduced species in the Iberian Peninsula. The species was introduced for economic reasons in the south of the Peninsula, but it is currently abundant and widespread in other parts of the area. As an invasive species, it is regulated by different laws in the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, although exploitation of this crayfish is permitted by the central government in Spain, the species is subjected to severe restrictions in Portugal. Moreover, regional governments in Spain only allow recreational fishing of P. clarki, except in southern Spain where there is an industrial activity based on the red swamp crayfish. We propose compromise measures in order to reconcile the economic exploitation of this aquatic resource and environmental concerns. The proposal mainly consists of the sale of live male specimens of P. clarkii and of dead (processed) female specimens. Biological invasion resulting in new established populations of P. clarkii in the wild would therefore be impossible. Transformation of P. clarkii into an economic resource with minimum environmental hazard therefore seems feasible.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
