First record of the Indo-Pacific Cymothoa indica (Crustacea, Isopoda, Cymothoidae), a Lessepsian species in the Mediterranean Sea
AbstractCymothoa indica, a typical Indo-Pacific genus and species, is reported for the first time in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Specimens were found parasitizing mainly barracudas (Sphyraenidae) from Lebanon. Female and male specimens are described on collected materials. To date, the genus Cymothoa has not been reported in the Mediterranean Sea although it is widely represented in other areas of the world. It is suggested that C. indica should be added to the list of exotic species introduced from the Red Sea and known as Lessepsian migrants.
