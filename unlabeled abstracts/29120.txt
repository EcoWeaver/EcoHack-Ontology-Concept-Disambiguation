Swimming and hiding regardless of the habitat: prey fish do not choose between a native and a non-native macrophyte species as a refuge
The ability to respond to a predation threat may be the key factor guaranteeing prey survival. Thus, small-sized fish may adapt to use macrophyte patches as refuge in ecosystems where they face predators. We evaluated the habitat choices made by a small-sized fish species (prey), observing whether these fish prefer to exploit submerged macrophyte stands of a native or a recently introduced species. This basic setup was applied in three predator cue treatments: no cue, chemical cue from a hungry predator and actual presence of a satiated predator. We first empirically tested the theoretical assumption that prey are adapted to use vegetated habitats and that the actual predator has a stronger effect on the choice of structured habitat than a chemical cue. Then, we tested the hypothesis that prey does not choose a specific habitat and increasing predation risk does not change this pattern. We found that the prey fish preferred vegetated habitats, however, they were unable to distinguish native from invasive macrophytes. Therefore, we obtained evidence to suggest that the physical structure provided by macrophytes appears to be more important than the evolutionary history of the fish together with a native macrophyte species in determining habitat choice.
