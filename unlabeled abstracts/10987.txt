Impact of the colonisation of Zaprionus (Diptera, Drosophilidae) in different ecosystems of the Neotropical Region: 2 years after the invasion
The drosophilid Zaprionus indianus was not collected in Brazil, despite on-going drosophilid collecting, until 1999. Since 1999 this species has become common in Brazil. We present data on collections of Z. indianus in central Brazil, since its first occurrence in this region, with the goal of discussing its route of introduction in South America and aspects of its adaptation to the environment. Collections made during a 2-year period show different seasonal distribution patterns of this insect. In contrast with the low population sizes registered in 1999, during the summer of 2000 a large proliferation of this insect was detected. We show that Z. indianus is more common in the savanna sites and that its population peaks during the wet season. These preferences are discussed, and the hypothesis that the introduction in South America should have occurred in the southeast region of this continent is defended.
