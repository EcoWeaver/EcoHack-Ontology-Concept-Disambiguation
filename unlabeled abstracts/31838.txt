Physical insights of ultrasound-assisted ethanol production from composite feedstock of invasive weeds
Invasive weeds ubiquitously found in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems form potential feedstock for lignocellulosic ethanol production. The present study has reported a bioprocess for production of ethanol using mixed feedstock of 8 invasive weeds found in India. The feedstock was subjected to pretreatment comprising dilute acid hydrolysis (for hydrolysis of hemicellulosic fraction), alkaline delignification and enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic fraction. Pentose-rich and hexose-rich hydrolyzates obtained from pretreatment were fermented separately using microbial cultures of S. cerevisiae and C. shehatae. Fermentation mixture was sonicated at 35 kHz at 10% duty cycle. The time profiles of total reducing sugars, ethanol and biomass was fitted to a kinetic model using Genetic Algorithm. Sonication boosted the kinetics of fermentation 2-fold. The net bioethanol yield of the process was ~220 g/kg raw biomass (with contributions of 86.8 and 133 g/kg raw biomass from pentose and hexose fermentations, respectively). Comparative evaluation of parameters of kinetic model under control and test conditions revealed several beneficial influences of sonication on both pentose and hexose fermentation systems such as faster transport of nutrients, substrate and products across cell membrane, rise in Monod saturation constant for substrate with concurrent reduction in substrate inhibition, and reduction of energy requirements for cell maintenance. Flow cytometry analysis of native and ultrasound-treated cells revealed no adverse influence of sonication on cell viability.
