Uniparental genetic markers to investigate hybridization in wild-born marmosets with a mixed phenotype among Callithrix aurita and invasive species
AbstractThe native marmoset of the Southeastern Atlantic Forest in Brazil is among the 25 most endangered primates of the world. Hybridization with alien species is one of its main threats registered since the early 2000s based on phenotype, so far, without genetic confirmation. Using uniparental molecular markers, we analyzed 18 putative hybrids, captured from 2004 to 2013 in different localities of the Atlantic Forest. A nine base pair deletion in the SRY gene of C. aurita was used to investigate paternal ancestry. Maternal ancestry was assessed by DNA sequencing of ca. 455 bp from the COX2 gene. Hybridization was confirmed for 16 out of the 18 marmosets since they inherited COX2 haplotypes of the alien C. penicillata or C. jacchus and the SRY deletion specific to C. aurita. Two individuals inherited both parental lineages of C. aurita, which is probably related to backcrossing or hybrid interbreeding. The direction of hybridization of females with the matrilineal lineage of invasive species with males descending from the native lineage was predominant in our sampling. This is the first time that hybridization between C. aurita and invasive species has been confirmed through genetic analysis.
