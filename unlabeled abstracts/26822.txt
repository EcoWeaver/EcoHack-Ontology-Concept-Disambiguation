Survival rates in the Czech Republic of introduced plants known as wool aliens
The paper analyses an unintentional experiment conducted 40years ago with species termed wool aliens which were observed in employee garden allotments of a wool-processing factory in Brno, Czech Republic. The waste from processing was used as a garden fertilizer, and alien species were recorded by Dvork and Khn (1966) Zavlecen rostliny na pozemcch prdelny vlny 'Mosilana' n.p. v Brne. Preslia 38: 327-332. The survival of these species was assessed by their occurrence in the current alien flora of the Czech Republic. Of the 56 species introduced in the 1960s and classified as wool aliens, 18 are still present in the Czech alien flora. The remaining 38 species are considered extinct, i.e. alien plants not capable of long-term survival in the country. The resulting survival rate of wool aliens is 22.1%. Three species on the list (5.4%) were clearly capable of naturalization. Compared to the other alien flora of the Czech Republic, wool aliens were disproportionally introduced from Australia, Africa and South and Central America. Species from Europe and Africa tended to survive the best. Grasses were most strongly represented, contributing 62.5% to wool alien species but only 7.9% to the total Czech neophyte flora. All surviving species were annuals, whereas none of the perennials survived; the survival rate in annuals was 37.5%. Survival of species introduced with wool was significantly comparable to their performance in the UK and in Central Europe, indicating that survival is not determined by mere chance and that the same species tend to be successful elsewhere in Europe. Maximum height and the month of first flowering were not significantly related to the species survival. The role of specific events in the enrichment of alien floras is discussed.
