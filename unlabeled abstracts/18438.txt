Comparing silvopastoral systems and prospects in eight regions of the world
Silvopasture systems combine trees, forage, and livestock in a variety of different species and management regimes, depending on the biophysical, economic, cultural, and market factors in a region. We describe and compare actual farm practices and current research trials of silvopastoral systems in eight regions within seven countries of the world: Misiones and Corrientes provinces, Argentina; La Pampa province, Argentina; northwestern Minas Gerais, Brazil; the Aysen region of Patagonia, Chile; the North Island of New Zealand; the Southeast United States; Paraguay; and Uruguay. Some countries use native trees and existing forests; some use plantations, particularly of exotic species. Natural forest silvopasture systems generally add livestock in extensive systems, to capture the benefits of shade, forage, and income diversification without much added inputs. Plantation forest systems are more purposive and intensive, with more focus on joint production and profits, for small owners, large ranches, and timber companies. Trends suggest that more active management of both natural and planted silvopastoral systems will be required to enhance joint production of timber and livestock, achieve income diversification and reduce financial risk, make more profit, improve environmental benefits, and realize more resilience to adapt to climate change.
