A review of the status and range expansion of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) in Ireland
Although common carp are known to have been present in Ireland since the early 17th century, historically the species' distribution was extremely localised. Owing to the popularity of carp as a sport fish in more recent times, it was suspected that the species range had expanded. Distribution maps were constructed from records in the published literature and consultations with both angling and governmental bodies, facilitating a review of the temporal changes in the range and distribution of carp from 1950 to the present day. There has been a significant increase in the range of distribution of carp, by order of 302% in the national 10 km grid-square network. The characteristic pattern of extinction and colonisation of carp in Irish water bodies clearly indicates that the species has not spread by natural dispersal but rather by human-mediated transfers, which are the mechanism for the species' range expansion. While carp has been able to establish self-sustaining populations in Ireland, these remain restricted to smaller, often land-locked, water bodies. Future climatic warming and the increasing popularity of carp as an angling quarry may facilitate further range expansion, both naturally and human mediated.
