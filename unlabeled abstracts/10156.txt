Distribution and Abundance of an Exotic Ground-Beetle (Carabidae): A Test of Community Impact
The distribution and wing morph proportions of Pterostichus melanarius and the possible effects of this exotic species on native carabid assemblages in central Alberta were studied along pitfall trapping transects out of Edmonton. The species was first reported from Edmonton in 1959, but is today one of the most abundant carabids in the city and is also common up to 70km from Edmonton. The proportion of macropterous individuals of this dimorphic species increased from 20% in Edmonton to 60-70% in the most distant populations, suggesting that flight is a major mode of range expansion. P. melanarius did not show negative pairwise associations with any of the abundant native spoecies and was not associated with reduced numbers of species or individuals or with diminished carabid diversity in aspen-poplar forest. The success of the species in rapidly invading natural forested habitats, often viewed as less prone to invasion than are human-modified habitats, is attributed to good migratory ability of macropterous individuals, flexible habitat use and lack of biological resistance in the native assemblages. -from Authors
