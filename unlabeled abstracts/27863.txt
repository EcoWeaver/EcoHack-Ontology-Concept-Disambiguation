Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of the genetic structure of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, in the Mississippi River
1. We predicted that zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas), genetic structure in the Mississippi River would follow a model of invasive species genetics, which predicts low genetic structure among populations of recently established species. This prediction was upheld in our previous genetic study using allozymes, however, one locus yielded anomalous results. 2. We employed amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis as a neutral marker to assess the amount of genetic structure within and among populations, and as a test of expected population structure from both invasion genetic theory, and the results from our previous study. 3. There was greater spatial differentiation, as measured by Fst, observed using AFLP's than for allozymes (P < 0.001). There was no evidence that AFLP variation conformed to an isolation by distance model, and genetic relationships of populations, as measured by AFLP markers, were not similar to those detected in our allozyme survey. 4. The lack of concordance between these two genetic marker systems probably reflects their differential responses to drift, migration, and selection occurring during this rapid invasion. Strong population structure is counter to predictions that populations of invasive species will not be differentiated, as with observations based on allozyme markers. Therefore, newly established species may require genetic surveys using multiple marker systems to evaluate population structure.
