Invasion of woody species into temperate grasslands: Relationship with abiotic and biotic soil resource heterogeneity
Question: Invasion of woody species into grasslands is a global phenomenon. This is also topical in semi-natural temperate grasslands that are no longer profitable for agricultural management. Trees and grasses interact through harsh root competition, but below-ground processes have been neglected in the dynamics of semi-natural grasslands. Trees are thought to have a competitive advantage in resource-rich and heterogeneous soils. We tested whether soil resource quantity and heterogeneity differ between paired temperate semi-natural grasslands and forests (former grasslands), and whether this was caused abiotically by varying soil depth or biotically by fine roots.
