Urban Ecology of Invasive Giant African Snail Achatina fulica (Ferussac) (Gastropoda: Achatinidae) on its First Recorded Sites in the Ecuadorian Amazon
We are reporting the first locality of invasive giant African snail, Achatina (Lissachatina) fulica (Ferussac, 1821) in the Ecuadorian Amazon. It was found present in 32 out of 50 urban sites studied. The abundance where present was relatively high when compared to literature from other parts of the world. The snails were found in aggregations, usually foraging -- most often on dogs' feces. Statistical analysis suggests a preference toward this source of alimentation. This is the first report of such preference in this species, which is highly significant considering the possible implications. Besides the threat posed by an invasive species to the invaluable ecosystems of the Amazon, the pathogens transferred by A. fulica combined with a high abundance of the species in an urban environment and its food preferences may constitute an important health hazard for local human populations.
