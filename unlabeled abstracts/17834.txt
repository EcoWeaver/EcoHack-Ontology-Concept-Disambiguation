Escaping captivity: The biological invasion risk from vertebrate species in zoos
Since 1870 we recorded 230 escapes (or thefts) from Australian zoos.*Escapes were much more common than thefts.*Reptiles were more likely to be stolen than other vertebrates.*Birds had the highest likelihood of escape, and the lowest likelihood of recovery.*The establishment of alien species from Australian zoos is extremely low.
