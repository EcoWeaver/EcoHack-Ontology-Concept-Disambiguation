The increasing distribution of Gammarus roeselii Gervais, 1835: first record of the non-indigenous freshwater amphipod in the sub-lacustrine Ticino River basin (Lombardy, Italy)
This paper reports the first record of the non-indigenous species Gammarus roeselii Gervais, 1835 in the sub-lacustrine Ticino River basin (Po river floodplain, Northern Italy). Up to now in Italy, this Balkanian amphipod, known as an " exotic species, well established " in Central Europe, had only been reported in the NorthEastern part of the country (Sile River basin). Gammarus roeselii has a low spreading potential, so its presence in other parts of Europe can only be explained by human activities. However, the available data suggests that its presence in the sub-lacustrine Ticino River basin does not currently represent a threat to the population of the native Echinogammarus stammeri, which is still very healthy in this area.
