First record of the exotic isopod Sphaeroma serratum (Crustacea: Isopoda) from Uruguayan waters (southwestern Atlantic)
The isopod Sphaeroma serratum (Fabricius, 1787) is reported from Uruguay for the first time and it is considered an introduced species in the region. The species was found very abundant and specimens were collected under the rocks in an intertidal area at La Paloma port in 2002 (34o39'S, 54o08'W). The specimens we examined fully agree with previous descriptions. Considering that this species has been reported as introduced in Argentina and Brazil, here we hypothesized the potential routes of introduction to Uruguay.
