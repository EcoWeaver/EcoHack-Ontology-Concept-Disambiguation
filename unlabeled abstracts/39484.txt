Archaeal and bacterial communities assembly and co-occurrence networks in subtropical mangrove sediments under Spartina alterniflora invasion
AbstractBackgroundMangrove ecosystems are vulnerable due to the exoticSpartina alterniflora(S. alterniflora) invasion in China. However, little is known about mangrove sediment microbial community assembly processes and interactions underS. alterniflorainvasion. Here, we investigated the assembly processes and co-occurrence networks of the archaeal and bacterial communities underS. alterniflorainvasion along the coastlines of Fujian province, southeast China.ResultsAssembly of overall archaeal and bacterial communities was driven predominantly by stochastic processes, and the relative role of stochasticity was stronger for bacteria than archaea. Co-occurrence network analyses showed that the network structure of bacteria was more complex than that of the archaea. The keystone taxa often had low relative abundances (conditionally rare taxa), suggesting low abundance taxa may significantly contribute to network stability. Moreover,S. alterniflorainvasion increased bacterial and archaeal drift process (part of stochastic processes), and improved archaeal network complexity and stability, but decreased the network complexity and stability of bacteria. This could be attributed toS. alterniflorainvasion influenced microbial communities diversity and dispersal ability, as well as soil environmental conditions.ConclusionsThis study fills a gap in the community assembly and co-occurrence patterns of both archaea and bacteria in mangrove ecosystem underS. alterniflorainvasion. Thereby provides new insights of the plant invasion on mangrove microbial biogeographic distribution and co-occurrence network patterns.
