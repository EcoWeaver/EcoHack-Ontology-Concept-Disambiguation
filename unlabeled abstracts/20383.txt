Immediate tasks of introduction of woody plants in Asian Russia
The paper analyzes the studies (beginning with the first works by Laxmann in the early 18th century) of the introduction of woody plants on the territory of Asian Russia. A special attention is given to the main introductory centers of Siberia and Russian Far East. It is shown that the first stage of the tests of the species from various botanical-geographical areas results only in the diversification of the woody species suitable for gardening and landscaping. The further studies require more serious and multidimensional research of the trees and shrubs under the conditions of the primary introduction so as to introduce them into the culture and use for creating artificial landscapes of various functions (forest amelioration, land reclamation, preserving rare and endangered species of the world flora, etc.). The special emphasis is put on the search for botanical-geographical areas as potential donors of introduced species using the method of climate comparison that we have developed. It is recommended to create the introduction centers in Siberia and the Far East. Keywordsintroduction-woody plants-Asian Russia-donors of introduced species
