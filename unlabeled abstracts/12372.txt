Raptors as legitimate secondary dispersers of weed seeds
Although raptors are not usually seen as seed dispersers, we demonstrate their important ecological role as legitimate seed dispersers of weeds. On the oceanic island of Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands, up to 11 000 weed seeds from a total of 39 and 62 different plant species respectively were found in the pellets of two native predatory birds, the Common Buzzard Buteo buteo and the Eurasian Kestrel Falco tinnunculus, which consumed European Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and Barbary Ground Squirrels Atlantoxerus getulus, both invasive mammals that carried these seeds in their guts. Four and seven weed species appeared with a frequency of occurrence greater than 10% in the pellets of Kestrels and Buzzards, respectively. Despite the time interval between pellet collection and germination experiments, almost 10% of planted seeds germinated, even after passing through two digestive processes, one inside the mammal and another inside the raptor. Our study encourages a change of perspective in this regard, as raptors may be involved in complex interactive dispersal processes on a wider geographical scale.
