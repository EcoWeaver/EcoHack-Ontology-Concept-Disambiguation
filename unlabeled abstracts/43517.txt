Distribution and predators of the invasive spider mite Tetranychus evansi (Acari: Tetranychidae) in the Syrian coastal region, with first record of predation by the native Scolothrips longicornis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae)
The tomato red spider mite, Tetranychus evansi Baker and Pritchard, has emerged as a destructive invasive pest of solanaceous crops worldwide. It was first recorded in Syria in 2011, in Latakia governorate, in the coastal region. Successful management of T. evansi in a given region benefits from information about its distribution, host plants, and associated natural enemies. Therefore, we investigated, in 2019 and 2020, the status of T. evansi on solanaceous plants in the Syrian coastal region, an important producer of solanaceous crops. A total of 237 samples were collected at 187 sites in Latakia and Tartus governorates. Tetranychus evansi was found in 34 cultivated and wild solanaceous plant samples collected at 29 sites distributed across all districts in those governorates, and in a variety of landscapes and elevations, ranging from the coastal plains to high altitudes in the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range. It was collected from three solanaceous crops, namely tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), as well as from two wild solanaceous plants: black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.) and red nightshade (Solanum villosum Mill.). A total of 14 species of predatory insects and mites, and five species of phytophagous mites, were identified in association with T. evansi. Predatory insects were more frequent and abundant than predatory mites. The insect predator Feltiella acarisuga (Vallot) was the most common and abundant species among the predators, followed by Stethorus gilvifrons (Mulsant) and Scolothrips longicornis Priesner. The predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot was the most frequent and abundant species of associated predatory mites.
