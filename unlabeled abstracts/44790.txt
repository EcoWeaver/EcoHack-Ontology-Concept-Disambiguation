Diversity of resident plant communities could weaken their allelopathic resistance against alien and native invaders
Elton's classic diversity-invasibility hypothesis posits that diversity of resident communities increases resistance against invaders. We tested whether the diversity-invasibility relationsip might be mediated by allelopathic effects of the resident species. In a large germination experiment, we exposed seeds of six alien and six native test species to leachates of one, three, six or twelve species. The leachates tended to slightly delay germination, and almost all single-species leachates reduced the proportion of germinated seeds. Nevertheless, the overall effect of the plant leachate mixtures on the proportion of germinated seeds was not significant. This was because a higher diversity of the leachates increased the proportion of germinated seeds, particularly for native test species. Among the six alien test species, it was only the most invasive one that benefited from increased diversity of the leachates, just like the natives did. Overall, our findings suggest that allelopathy of diverse communities does not provide resistance but could actually facilitate the germination of invaders.
