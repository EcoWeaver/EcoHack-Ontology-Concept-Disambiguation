Long-term changes in the littoral benthos of a Norwegian subalpine lake following the introduction of the European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus)
The littoral benthos of the subalpine lake, Ovre Heimdalsvatn, has been documented in a series of investigations carried out in 1972, 1976, 1985 and 2000. During this 28-year period there have been major changes in the benthos of the lake following the introduction of European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) into the lake where brown trout (Salmo trutta) was formerly the sole species. In 1972 Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Plecoptera and Gammarus lacustris dominated the macrobenthos, constituting 85% of faunal numbers, while Chironomidae and Oligochaeta made up only c. 6%. However, by 1976, chironomids and oligochaetes had increased in relative abundance, while G. lacustris declined. This trend towards a dominance of chironomids and oligochaetes was confirmed in 1985 and 2000, although absolute numbers of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera increased in 2000 relative to 1972 values. Gammarus lacustris had a 2-year life cycle in Ovre Heimdalsvatn. In 1972 there were significantly more females than males, but by 1976 and through to 2000 there were greater numbers of males. Despite this reduction in females, numbers of juveniles increased, although mortality, probably due to increased predation from minnows, was higher than earlier. The introduction of the alien species, the European minnow, into Ovre Heimdalsvatn has clearly changed the composition and structure of the littoral macroinvertebrate benthos.
