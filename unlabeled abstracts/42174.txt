Is biological invasion crucible for evolution?
During the invasion process multiply introductions via invasion corridors support contacts of propagules from populations isolated before. The contacts occur outside their native range in conditions of differently disturbed ecosystems. Universal genetic mechanisms form the material that is both diverse and unique for natural selective pressure in these contact zones. Invasions provide prerequisites for co-evolution of species having the same origin (and so far period of preceding co-evolution) and those of different regions. Their further co-evolution can occur in recipient system including as formation of new assemblages.
