Mycorrhizal strategies of tree species correlate with trailing range edge responses to current and past climate change
As climates shift in space, tree species ranges are predicted to shift as well. While range shifts due to climate change have been typically modeled based on abiotic factors alone, interactions among species in diverse communities may alter these range dynamics by inhibiting or enhancing the establishment of propagules along the leading edge, or by increasing or decreasing tolerance to novel climates at the trailing edge. Here, we investigated how the rate of expansion at leading range margins, and contraction at trailing range margins of temperate tree species in response to both past and current climate change related to an important species interaction: whether temperate tree species associate with arbuscular (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal symbionts. Mycorrhizal symbioses can mediate plant stress tolerance, and lack of EM fungal mutualists has been linked to establishment failures of EM tree species in new ranges. We found no difference in rates of leading edge expansion between the two guilds. However, EM tree taxa showed reduced contraction at their trailing edge compared to AM taxa in response to both past and current climate change. Since the mycorrhizal guild of the dominant trees may affect ecosystem properties, differential range dynamics between these functional groups of trees may have consequences for the functioning of future forests.
