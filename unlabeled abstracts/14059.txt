Biotic resistance buffers the effects of nutrient enrichment on the success of a highly invasive aquatic plant
* Biotic resistance theory predicts that the presence of a species-rich native community is able to inhibit the establishment of invasive species. On the other hand, disturbed environments, for example, through eutrophication, tend to be more easily invaded. * We investigated the effect of biotic resistance on the establishment success of the aquatic grass Urochloa arrecta in nutrient-enriched and non-enriched mesocosms so as to test the hypothesis that the effects of biotic resistance on invader success depend on ecosystem trophic state. * Invader success, measured as plant biomass and length, increased with nutrient enrichment in treatments without biotic resistance, whereas there was no difference between the success of the invader in enriched or non-enriched mesocosms in the presence of biotic resistance. * Our results suggest that eutrophication enhanced the resistance offered by the native community and thereby reduced the establishment of invaders. The results underscore the importance of native communities as biotic filters to invasion, especially in environments that are subjected to anthropogenic impacts such as nutrient enrichment.
