On the Invasion of the Genus Marenzelleria (Polychaeta, Spionidae) Representatives into the Caspian Sea Basin
In 2018, in the bottom fauna of the Caspian Sea, single specimens of a previously unknown species of polyhaetes were discovered. Since 2019, pelagic larvae of this species have been recorded in zooplankton samples. These worms are also found in the nutrition of migratory and semi-migratory fish species. According to morphological features, this polychaete species is identified as Marenzelleria arctia , an Arctic species dominating in the Gulf of Finland and probably invaded the Caspian along the Volga-Caspian invasion corridor.
