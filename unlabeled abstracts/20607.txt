Lost in the weeds: Ligustrum sinense reduces native plant growth and survival
Plant invasions are often implicated in declines of native plant species. However, common experimental designs have received criticism questioning the assumption that invasive plants are the primary cause for ecosystem deterioration. We used a combination of field observations and a transplant experiment to investigate the influence of an exotic invasive shrub, Ligustrum sinense (Chinese Privet) on native plant species in Piedmont floodplain forests of South Carolina, USA. We conducted vegetation surveys of 12 floodplain forests documenting abundance and cover of all herbaceous and woody plant species. Additionally, we established an experimental garden to compare survival and growth of L. sinense and four common native species transplanted into a mature L. sinense stand and an adjacent uninvaded area over two growing seasons. The vegetation survey demonstrated a strong negative relationship between L. sinense presence and herbaceous vegetation. As L. sinense cover increased, herbaceous cover and height, plant abundance, and native species richness decreased. In our transplant experiment we found drastic effects of L. sinense on native plant seedling survival and growth. Survival for all native species was lower under the L. sinense canopy and native seedling growth was substantially reduced. Results from both the vegetation survey and transplant experiment show that invasion of L. sinense suppresses herbaceous understory and prevents regeneration of native species by reducing seedling survival and growth. With an approach that combines multiple field sites and local site-specific investigations our research provides strong evidence that L. sinense is an agent of change in floodplain forests.
