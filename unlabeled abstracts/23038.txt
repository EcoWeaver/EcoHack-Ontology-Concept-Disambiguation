Shading by an invasive macrophyte has cascading effects on sediment chemistry
The submersed freshwater macrophyte Utricularia inflata is a recent invader of Adirondack Mountain lakes (NY, USA). Previous experiments suggested that U. inflata can indirectly change nutrient cycling in Adirondack lake ecosystems by reducing the growth of native isoetid macrophytes, which in turn affects sediment chemistry. A 13-week greenhouse experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that shading can explain the detrimental effect of U. inflata on the native short-statured isoetid, Eriocaulon aquaticum. Eriocaulon aquaticum has a dense root system that oxidizes sediment by releasing oxygen; it also takes up carbon dioxide from sediment. Growth and asexual reproduction of E. aquaticum grown under shaded conditions was reduced significantly compared to an unshaded control (P<0.001). Shading resulted in sediment changes: redox potential fell from 216mV in the absence of shading to 76mV under four layers of shade cloth (P<0.0001). Shading also increased the concentration of extractable sediment ammonium (P<0.01), as well as carbon dioxide concentrations (P<0.0001) and pH of porewater (P<0.05). The effect of U. inflata on the native isoetids and consequently on sediment chemistry closely matched the impact of shade cloth with similar light attenuation. Our results indicate that the principal mechanism by which U. inflata affects native isoetids and sediment chemistry is shading.
