Effects of invasive aquatic carrion on soil chemistry and terrestrial microbial communities
Carrion plays a crucial role in the recycling of nutrients and organic matter in ecosystems. Yet, despite their ecological importance, studies addressing the relevance of carrion originated from invasive alien species (IAS) in the interface between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are uncommon, especially those assessing belowground effects. In this study, we carried out a manipulative experiment to assess the impact of massive mortalities of the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774) as a carrion subsidy evaluating possible effects on the terrestrial soil chemistry and the structure of a microbial (bacteria and fungi) community. We placed five levels of C. fluminea density (0, 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 ind. m-2) and samples were collected 7, 30 and 90 days after clams' addition. The results revealed that C. fluminea carrion have a significant effect belowground, especially on nutrients content (mainly NH4+, NO2-, NO3- and PO43-), fungal biomass and fungal and bacterial diversity. Given the predicted increase and intensification of extreme climatic events and the widespread distribution of several aquatic IAS (including bivalve species such as C. fluminea) the ecological importance of these massive mortalities (and resulting carrion) cannot be ignored because they may affect microbial communities with significant impacts on nutrient cycling, even in adjacent terrestrial habitats.
