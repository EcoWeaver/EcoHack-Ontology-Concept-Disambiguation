Role of sexual reproduction in the spread of an invasive clonal plant Solidago canadensis revealed using intersimple sequence repeat markers
Invasive species, second only to habitat loss as a cause of biodiversity loss, pose serious threats to native biodiversity and ecosystems. Little is known about the mechanisms that some exotic plants use to become invasive in their non-native ranges. Solidago canadensis, native to North America, was intentionally introduced to many countries where it has become an invasive plant. To understand the roles that reproductive mode plays in successful invasion of exotic plants, and the relative importance of sexual reproduction and clonal growth, the genetic diversity and clonal structure of two S. canadensis populations from Shanghai, China were investigated using intersimple sequence repeats. Samples were collected in a grid pattern with intervals of 2 m among adjacent individuals within the studied area (approximately 30 m x 30 m) for each population. Results showed that the percentages of polymorphic loci for the two populations were 97.9% and 96.5% and clonal diversity measured using the Simpson Diversity Index was 1.00 for both populations. No identical genotypes were found among the analyzed samples. It is suggested from this study that sexual reproduction facilitates the establishment of new S. canadensis populations, whereas clonal expansion maintains and enlarges the established populations. Thus, limiting sexual reproduction of S. canadensis may effectively control the invasion of this species.
