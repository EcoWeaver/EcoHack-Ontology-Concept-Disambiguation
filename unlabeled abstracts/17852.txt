"Invented Invaders"
Invasive species, defined as exotic species that reach pest status, are major threats to global biodiversity. Although invasive species can belong to any taxonomic group, general characteristics such as rapid growth and reproduction are shared by many invasive species. "Invented Invaders" is a collaborative activity in which students invent and draw the "perfect" invasive species, made up of a combination of characteristics of actual invasive species in their geographic region. Students then list sustainable ways to control or manage the invented invader. This activity engages students and educates them about a continuing global problem while encouraging creativity and advocacy for the environment.
