Potential impact of invasive amphipods on leaf litter recycling in aquatic ecosystems
The impact of biological invasions on local biodiversity is well established, but their impact on ecosystem functioning has only been sketchily documented. However, biological invasions may impede services provided by aquatic ecosystems, such as, for example, the decomposition of organic matter, a key process in most small streams. To address this question, we experimentally quantified the leaf litter breakdown activity of native and invasive amphipod species, which are keystone species in aquatic ecosystems. The breakdown rate of each species was used to estimate the potential leaf litter recycling in the Rhone and Meurthe Rivers in sites occupied solely by native species and sites dominated by invasive species. We found that invaders were not able to compensate for the activity of native species and that the replacement of native species led to a decrease of at least 66% in the rate of leaf litter recycling. Our approach provides empirical evidence of the functional impact of non-indigenous species on leaf litter recycling, using standard protocols and literature data.
