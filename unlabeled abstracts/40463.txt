Use of Exotic Saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis) by Birds in Arid Riparian Systems
Avian use of saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis) along the middle Pecos River was compared with similarly collected data along the lower Colorado River and Rio Grande. Use of saltcedar ranked high among all bird groups in all seasons on the middle Pecos River. In contrast, many species do not occur in saltcedar on the lower Colorado River, while few species winter in saltcedar on the lower Rio Grande. Occurrence of granivores and insectivores during winter in saltcedar on the Pecos River may be explained by seed-producing shrubs and annuals within or adjacent to these habitats. Most breeding birds on the Pecos River are summer visitors. These breeding species, though present, do not occur in saltcedar on the Colorado River despite abundant food resources and occur in intermediate abundances on the Rio Grande. Densities of several summer-visiting insectivores have declined markedly on the Colorado River since the proliferation of saltcedar, whereas they have remained relatively stable in other river valleys to the east. Biogeographical considerations, specifically elevational (climatic) gradients, are suggested reasons for this phenomenon.
