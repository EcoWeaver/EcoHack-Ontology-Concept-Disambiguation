Invasive tall annual willowherb (Epilobium brachycarpum C. Presl) in Central Europe originates from high mountain areas of western North America
Identification of the source population of biological invasions has important consequences for the effective control and management of the invader. Tall annual willowherb (Epilobium brachycarpum) is a relatively recent and rapidly spreading neophyte in Europe that was first detected in 1978. Populations of tall annual willowherb from Germany and northern France were analysed by AFLP fingerprinting together with samples from five different localities in its native range in western North America. Three genetically different groups were found corresponding to different altitude zones in the native range. The FST is high among all samples indicating a strong genetical separation of the three groups. Invasive populations showed much lower genetic diversity than the native population. Additionally invasive populations revealed genetic affinities to North American specimens originating particularly from high mountain areas. The two large German populations and the population from northern France are genetically distinct while the individuals within the populations are genetically uniform. This suggests multiple introduction events rather than one introduction with consequent spreading across Europe. A third small German population from Treis-Karden in the Mosel valley clusters with North American lowland populations but suffers from frost damage and its permanent establishment is doubtful.
