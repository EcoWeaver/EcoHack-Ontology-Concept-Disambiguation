Adapting to invasions in a changing world: invasive species as an economic resource.
Abstract Management and policy decisions regarding biological invasions and other aspects of global change such as the changing climate have the potential to influence one another. Recently, interest in harvest as an invasive species management strategy has surged. Researchers have speculated about the potential positive (e.g. population and impact reduction, economic losses recouped through new profits) and negative (e.g. generation of economic incentives to encourage further introductions) consequences of such management strategies, but few experimental analyses exist despite the fact that real-world 'experiments' in harvesting invasive species continue to accrue. This chapter provides the first comprehensive list of the many ways humankind has adapted to the presence of invasive species through harvest and considers trends that emerge from this list. The spectrum ranges from collection of feral invasive populations to cultivation of potential invaders as crops, and harvested invasive species serve a variety of purposes ranging from biofuels to foods. The costs of invasion and benefit from harvest can be difficult to quantify, and this difficulty is compounded by the fact that costs and benefits are often incurred by different stakeholders. Climate and other aspects of global change accompanying invasive species harvest have rarely been taken into account, and the climate effects of invasive species harvest should become an explicit consideration of harvest strategies moving forward. Ecologists, economists, environmental managers and stakeholders must work together to ensure the successful and responsible application of ongoing harvests and to inform future efforts.
