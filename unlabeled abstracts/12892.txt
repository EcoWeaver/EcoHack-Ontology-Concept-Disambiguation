Effects of competition withBromus tectorumon early establishment ofPoa secundaaccessions: can seed source impact restoration success?
When landscapes are heavily impacted by biological invasion, local populations of native plant species may no longer be adapted to altered environmental conditions. In these cases, it is useful to investigate alternative sources of germplasm, such as cultivated varieties, for planting at restoration sites. This study compared cultivated and wild (local) varieties of the native perennial bunchgrass, Poa secunda J. Presl, grown with and without the exotic, invasive Bromus tectorum L. in a greenhouse setting. While P. secunda cultivars emerged and grew more rapidly than wild seed sources, this advantage declined in the presence of B. tectorum and cultivated germplasm did not outperform wild accessions in the presence of an invasive species. Given the novel genetic background of cultivars and their potential to alter patterns of dominance in native plant communities, we recommend the use of local or regional wild seed sources when possible to conserve regional patterns of genetic diversity and adaptation. Use of multiple seed sources may increase the potential for capturing vigorous genotypes in the restoration seed mix. In cases where sites are heavily impacted by exotic, invasive species, other control measures will be necessary to improve establishment of native species in grassland restoration programs.
