Criteria for determining native distributions of biota: the case of the northern plains killifish in the Cheyenne River drainage, North America
1.Criteria exist to help determine native distributions of species, but they are seldom explicitly used.2.As an example of their utility, nine revised and expanded criteria are applied to assess the status of northern plains killifish in the Cheyenne River drainage. Use of each criterion is demonstrated. The criteria are: (1) history, (2) detectibility, (3) biogeography, (4) life-history, (5) human affinity, (6) invasion path, (7) invasiveness, (8) phylogenetics, and (9) pre-history.3.Upon review, only one criterion weakly supports non-native status, whereas five strongly support native status, one weakly supports native status, and two are equivocal.4.Criteria to determine native distributions provide a rigorous method to assess available information, reveal knowledge gaps, and produce testable hypotheses. As demonstrated here, their consistent use as a cohesive set would greatly improve understanding of species distributions, benefiting conservation efforts and related meta-analyses.
