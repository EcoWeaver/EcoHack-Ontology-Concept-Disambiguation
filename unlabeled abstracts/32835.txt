Microbial invasions in sludge anaerobic digesters
https://rdcu.be/caWqx Among processes that control microbial community assembly, microbial invasion has received little attention until recently, especially in the field of anaerobic digestion. However, knowledge of the principles regulating the taxonomic and functional stability of microbial communities is key to truly develop better predictive models and effective management strategies for the anaerobic digestion process. To date, available studies focus on microbial invasions in digesters feed with activated sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants. Herein, this review summarizes the importance of invasions for anaerobic digestion management, the ecological theories about microbial invasions, the traits of activated sludge microorganisms entering the digesters, and the resident communities of anaerobic reactors that are relevant for invasions and the current knowledge about the success and impacts of invasions, and discusses the research needs on this topic. The initial data indicate that the impact of invasions is low and only a small percentage of the mostly aerobic microorganisms present in the activated sludge feed are able to become stablished in the anaerobic digesters. However, there are still numerous unknowns about microbial invasions in anaerobic digestion including the influence of anaerobic feedstocks or process perturbances that new approaches on microbial ecology could unveil.
