Life-history traits of non-native freshwater fish invaders differentiate them from natives in the Central European bioregion
The most successful and widespread non-indigenous invasive fish species occurring in the Central European bioregion are heterogeneous with respect to their origins, taxonomy, mode of arrival, vectors and pathways of dispersal. We surveyed whether these non-native species have common life-history that might facilitate their invasion and differentiate them from native species. Ten life-history traits of 59 freshwater fish species were examined: maximum body length, longevity, age and length at maturation, maximum absolute fecundity, egg size, larval size at hatching, spawning duration and type, parental investment. Principal Component Analysis revealed that the traits that accounted for the first two principle components (86.4 % of total variation) were maximum body length, age and size at maturation, longevity, fecundity, egg size and larval length at hatching. Five groups of species were distinguished by cluster analysis, those comprising native fish species being characterized by medium-to-large size, elevated longevity, late maturation, high fecundity, and no parental care. In contrast, groups of non-native invasive fish species were characterized by small-to-medium body length, short longevity, early maturation, relatively low fecundity, relatively large eggs, multiple spawning, extended reproductive seasons and some form of parental care. These life-history traits, along with broad diet breath and environmental tolerance, appear to facilitate the invasion of freshwater fish in the Central European bioregion.
