Human impact upon the environment in the vicinity of Arctowski Station, King George Island, Antarctica
During thirty three expeditions to the Polish Arctowski Antarctic Station signifi- cant influences of human activity upon the environment have been recorded. Introductions of alien species, shifts of bird and seal breeding areas and decreases in both bird and seal populations, are the most obvious effects of human pressure. Though numbers of visits by tourists have increased during this period, impacts from expeditioners appear to be the main cause of changes. In particular, increasing numbers and mobility of summer groups at the station are the likely most influential factors.
