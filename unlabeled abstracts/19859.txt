Native invaders - challenges for science, management, policy, and society
The term "invader" is typically paired with adjectives such as "non-native" and "alien", yet native species can also cause ecological and economic impacts that rival those of well-known invasive species. By spreading within their historical range, attaining extreme abundances, and exerting severe per-capita effects as a result of predation or competition, native invaders can create an unusual set of challenges for science, management, policy, and society. Identifying when, where, and why species become invaders in their native ranges requires additional scientific inquiry, outside the current focus of invasion biology. Management strategies often mitigate the symptoms rather than address the causes of problematic native species invasions. Convincing stakeholders to comply with management actions aimed at controlling native invaders creates societal challenges and policy makers must prioritize goals from varied and often conflicting human interests. We illustrate these challenges by highlighting native species that adversely affect threatened and endangered Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp).
