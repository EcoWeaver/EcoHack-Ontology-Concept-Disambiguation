Restoration impacts on fuels and fire potential in a dryland tropical ecosystem dominated by the invasive grass Megathyrsus maximus
Ecological restoration often attempts to promote native species while managing for disturbances such as fire and non-native invasions. The goal of this research was to investigate whether restoration of a non-native, invasive Megathyrsus maximus (guinea grass) tropical grassland could simultaneously promote native species and reduce fire potential. Megathyrsus maximus was suppressed with herbicide, and three suites of native species--each including the same groundcover and shrub, and one of three tree species--were outplanted in a randomized, complete block design that also included herbicide control (herbicide with no outplantings) and untreated control treatments. Fuels were quantified 27 months after outplanting, and potential fire behavior (rate of spread and flame length) was modeled with BehavePlus. Compared with untreated controls, native outplant treatments reduced M. maximus cover by 76-91% and M. maximus live and dead fuel loads by greater than 92 and 68%, respectively. Despite reductions in M. maximus fuels, neither treatment-level (grass + native) total fuel loads and fuel moistures, nor modeled fire behavior differed between outplant treatments and controls. The best performing native woody species (Dodonaea viscosa) had significantly lower average individual plant live fuel moisture (84%) than M. maximus (156%) or other native woody outplant species (201-328%), highlighting the need for careful species selection. These results demonstrate that restoring native species to degraded tropical dry forests is possible, but that ecological restoration will not necessarily alter the potential for fire, at least in the short term, making selection of species with beneficial fuel properties and active fire management critical components of ongoing restoration.
