Benthic invaders control the phosphorus cycle in the world's largest freshwater ecosystem
Significance The ecosystems of the Laurentian Great Lakes have been dramatically reengineered by invasive bottom-dwelling dreissenid mussels. A key question is whether this biological change has altered whole-ecosystem biogeochemistry, in particular the cycling of phosphorus, a key nutrient that limits biological productivity in freshwater ecosystems. We show that phosphorus cycling in the invaded Great Lakes is now regulated by the population dynamics of a single benthic species, the quagga mussel. This qualitatively changes the responses of the affected lakes to phosphorus inputs from watersheds, complicates predictions, and necessitates a new paradigm for managing these large aquatic ecosystems. Similar changes likely play out in many other dreissenid-invaded lakes across Europe and North America.
