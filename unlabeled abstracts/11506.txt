Oysters and the Chesapeake Bay Ecosystem: A Case for Exotic Species Introduction to Improve Environmental Quality?
Restoration of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem has been a priority for residents and governments of the bay watershed for the past decade. One obstacle in the efforts to "save the bay" has been continuing nutrient enrichment from agricultural and sewer runoff. The attainability of a mandated 40% nutrient reduction goal has yet to be seen. Furthermore, disappearance of certain organisms may have had an adverse effect on the resilience of the ecosystem. The Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), once abundant in Chesapeake Bay, was a vital part of the food web, processing excess phytoplankton and depositing materials on the bottom. Over harvesting and disease have decimated the native oyster population. The introduction of an exotic species, the Japanese oyster (Crassostrea gigas), may be a way to reestablish a robust oyster community in the bay. The literature on the role of bivalve molluscs in estuarine ecosystems shows that they are an essential part of healthy estuaries around the world. A comparison of C. virginica and C. gigas in terms of temperature and salinity tolerance and resistance to disease shows that C. virginica is ideally adapted to conditions in Chesapeake Bay, but it is unable to stave off the endemic diseases, whereasC. gigas is adapted to conditions in the lower bay only but is much less susceptible to the same diseases. We conclude that the potential introduction of C. gigas to Chesapeake Bay would be limited by the Japanese species' physiological requirements but that the revitalization of a bivalve population is imperative to the restoration of ecosystem function.
