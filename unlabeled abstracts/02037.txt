Invasive mammal eradication on islands results in substantial conservation gains
Significance Global conservation actions to prevent or slow extinctions and protect biodiversity are costly. However, few conservation actions have been evaluated for their efficacy globally, hampering the prioritization of conservation actions. Islands are key areas for biodiversity conservation because they are home to more than 15% of terrestrial species and more than one-third of critically endangered species; nearly two-thirds of recent extinctions were of island species. This research quantifies the benefits to native island fauna of removing invasive mammals from islands. Our results highlight the importance of this conservation measure for protecting the world's most threatened species.
