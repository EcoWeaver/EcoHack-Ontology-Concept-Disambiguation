How Predator Food Preference can Change the Destiny of Native Prey in Predator-Prey Systems
The aim of this work is to develop and analyse a mathematical model for a predator-2 preys system arising in insular environments. We are interested in the evolution of a native prey population without behavioural traits to cope with predation or competition, after the introduction of alien species. Here, we consider a long living bird population with low fertility rate. We point out the effects of the preference of the predator for either juvenile or adult stages. In addition, we study the impact of alien prey introduction in such a model. We use a reaction-diffusion system with a singular logistic right hand side. The aim of this work is to bring interesting dynamics to the fore. As a first example, oscillatory behaviour takes place in the model without alien preys and when predators have an average preference coefficient. Introduction of alien preys can lead to species extinction.
