The effects of impoundment and non-native species on a river food web in Mexico's central plateau
Habitat modifications, non-native species and other anthropogenic impacts have restructured fish communities in lotic ecosystems of central Mexico. Conservation of native fishes requires understanding of food web changes resulting from the introduction of non-native species, flow alteration and other human impacts. Using d13C and d15N analysis of fishes and invertebrates we investigated the effects of non-native species, and reservoirs on food webs of the Laja river ecosystem (Guanajuato, central Mexico). We estimated trophic position (TP), relative trophic niche and food web dispersion at 11 reservoir, river and tailwater sites. Reservoirs and non-native fishes modified food webs in the Laja. Food web dispersion was greater in reservoir than in tailwater and river sites. Reservoir food webs had the greatest range of d13C values, indicating a more diverse resource base compared to rivers. d13C values increased with distance downstream from reservoirs, suggesting declining subsidies of river food webs by reservoir productivity. Stable isotopes revealed potential effects of non-native fishes on native fishes via predation or competition. Non-native Micropterus salmoides were top predators in the system. Non-natives Cyprinus carpio, Oreochromis mossambicus and Carassius auratus exhibited lowest TP in the Laja but overlapped significantly with most native species, indicating potential for resource competition. Native Chirostoma jordani was the only species with a significantly different trophic niche from all other fish. Many rivers in central Mexico share similar anthropogenic impacts and similar biotas, such that food web patterns described here are likely indicative of other river systems in central Mexico.
