First record of the Asian leech Barbronia weberi (Blanchard, 1897) (Hirudinea: Arhynchobdellida: Erpobdelliformes: Salifidae) in the Iberian Peninsula
Barbronia weberi, an Asian leech, was found in September-October 2010 in a river from Central Spain. This is the first record of the species for the Iberian Peninsula and the Jarama River in particular, where in September-October 2010 the leech was collected during sampling for a bioassessment program. On the program's completion we expect to observe the seasonal dynamic of B. weberi population in the Jarama River.
