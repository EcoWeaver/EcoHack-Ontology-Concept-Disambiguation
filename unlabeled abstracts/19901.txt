Western Atlantic introduction and persistence of the marine bryozoan Tricellaria inopinata
Most species of bryozoans have short-lived larvae with limited dispersal potential, yet many of these species possess global distributions. In this study, we report the first occurrence from the western Atlantic Ocean of the widely distributed arborescent bryozoan Tricellaria inopinata d'Hondt and Occhipinti-Ambrogi, 1985. This species was collected in Eel Pond, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, in September 2010. At that time, T. inopinata colonies had already formed dense conspecific aggregations at some collection sites, despite the presence of several other arborescent bryozoans. Sites were monitored throughout 2011 to track the success of this introduction, and to assess the reproductive timing of T. inopinata in Eel Pond. To determine the likelihood of T. inopinata persisting in Eel Pond and competing with previously established bryozoans, rates of metamorphic initiation, metamorphic completion, and overall offspring survivability were compared to one of the other dominant arborescent species. Finally, we provide taxonomic details to aid in identifying these animals, consider the potential mode of transport, and discuss the potential ecological implications resulting from this introduction.
