The Ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Fauna of Black Belt Prairie Remnants in Alabama and Mississippi
Extensive areas of prairie were once found in the southeastern United States; however, in the last 200 years much of this habitat type has been destroyed. The largest of these prairie regions, the Black Belt Prairie, extends through portions of Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The ant fauna of these endangered grasslands has not been well documented; therefore, a survey was initiated, with collections made at 23 Black Belt Prairie remnants in Alabama and Mississippi during a four-year period. A total of 53 ant species, in six subfamilies and 25 genera were collected. Six exotic species were collected, and 11 species were found to be restricted to trees within the prairie, resulting in 36 species that likely represent the true prairie fauna.
