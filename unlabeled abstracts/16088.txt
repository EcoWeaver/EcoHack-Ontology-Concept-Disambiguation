Invasion dynamics of the snail Pseudoplotia scabra in Lake Kinneret
The freshwater snail Pseudoplotia scabra Muller (Thiaridae) was first spotted in Lake Kinneret, Israel, in the mid 2000s. In a series of field surveys we followed its spread, documenting how by the end of 2010 this invasive mollusc formed >95 % of the snails in Lake Kinneret, nearly eradicating four native species.
