Native plants: A Nazi obsession?
This article seeks to challenge recent narratives about Nazi policies against non-native species. Drawing on heretofore ignored evidence and recent publications that draw a more nuanced picture of Nazi Germany's environmental history, it argues that the topic of non-native species was in fact open to debate in Nazi Germany, without a clear preference for a certain position, let alone a state doctrine. Some people argued that Nazi ideas called for a preference for native plants, while others disagreed or even ridiculed that position without fear of prosecution or worse. Furthermore, it seems that those who argued for native species did so out of opportunistic reasons, rather than authentic ideological convictions. The paper thus argues to continue the discussion over native species without a cliched picture of alleged Nazi policies which threatens to poison an important cross-disciplinary debate.
