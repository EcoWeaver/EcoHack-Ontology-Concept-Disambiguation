Isolated populations of Eurytemora americana Williams (Crustacea, Copepoda) in the White Sea rock pools--postglacial relicts or anthropogenic invasions?
Molecular-genetic study of isolated populations of Eurytemora in the White Sea showed its undoubted proximity to the native North American populations of Eurytemora americana, Williams 1906. Genetic tests show the recent colonization of the White Sea rock pools by initially small amount of individuals of E. americana. Existing published data on the presence of isolated Atlantic and Pacific species in the Arctic region are mostly explained by historical reasons: preservation of relict populations formerly inhabited the Holarctic and separated by processes of formation and melting of glaciers. Finding of E. americana in the White Sea allowed us to suppose a possible reason of formation of these isolates: transportation with ship ballast waters during the period of intensive cargo in the Second World War along the edge of the Arctic seas.
