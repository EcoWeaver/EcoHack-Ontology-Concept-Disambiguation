Toxic toad invasion of Wallacea: A biodiversity hotspot characterized by extraordinary endemism
Invasions of poisonous species can cause rapid population declines among native fauna because predators are naive and often vulnerable to these toxins. The recent invasion of Madagascar by the poisonous Asian common toad, Duttaphrynus melanostictus, has sparked international attention (Kolby, 2015), as well as research and conservation efforts to predict the climate suitability of Madagascar for the invasive toads (Pearson 2015; Vences et al., 2017), pinpoint the origin of the invasive lineage (Wogan et al., 2016; Vences et al., 2017), determining the toads' distribution, and educating local communities (Andreone, 2014). While the invasion in Madagascar has received much attention, an invasion of this same toad species on the islands of Wallacea in eastern Indonesia is ongoing but virtually unrecognized.
