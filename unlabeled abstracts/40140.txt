DArTseq-derived SNPs for the genus Psidium reveal the high diversity of native species
In this study, we characterized DArTseq-derived SNPs for species of Psidium, an important Neotropical genus within the family Myrtaceae. Nine Psidium species were used for the identification and characterization of an interspecific set of SNPs. The samples chosen represented a wide range of variation regarding agronomic traits and geographical origin. The samples were genotyped using the DarTseq methodology. This approach, associated with annotation analysis, generated a set of conserved, polymorphic, and possibly functional SNPs. Most of the SNPs in coding regions of Psidium were annotated for the gene ontology classes. We observed high interspecific diversity among species and considerable intraspecific genetic diversity in native species (P. cattleyanum, P. myrtoides, P. acidum, and P. oblongatum). Psidium guajava, a cultivated species, shows low diversity and shares genetic similarities with the tetraploid P. guineense. The group of markers selected in this study will contribute to the development of a panel of interspecific SNPs for Psidium. Our investigation will support further studies regarding genetic variability, diversity, phylogeny, cytogenetics, and other relationships among Psidium species, constituting essential information for the creation, conservation, management, and use of genetic resources in breeding programs.
