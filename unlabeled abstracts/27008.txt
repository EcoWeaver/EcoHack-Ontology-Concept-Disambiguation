Native range of the zebra mussel and quagga mussel and new data on their invasions within the Ponto-Caspian Region
This is a special review on the native ranges of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha polymorpha) and quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis). Revision of museum collections showed that the Dniepr Delta is a native locality of the quagga mussel, for example in the Lower Southern Bug and that Dreissena presbensis occurs in the Aegean Sea Basin in Greece. The native range of the zebra mussel includes Danube, Dniestr, Berezan, Southern Bug, Dniepr, Molochnaya, Don, Kuban, Kamchia, and Veleca river basins; isolated and semi-isolated relic estuarian reservoirs along the Bulgarian, Romanian, Ukrainian, and Russian Black and Azov seas coasts; and in zones of these seas influenced by freshwater. Invasive dreissenids in Turkish rivers are local species and subspecies. More recent locations of the dreissenid expansion within the Ponto-Caspian region (Lake Sasyk, Baraboj River, and Sukhoj Liman Basin for the zebra mussel; Dniestr River Basin for the quagga mussel) are described. One empty valve of Dreissena polymorpha andrusovi was found in the Taganrog Bay.
