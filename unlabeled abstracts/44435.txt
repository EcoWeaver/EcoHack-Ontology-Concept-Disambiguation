Spatio-temporal dynamics of exotic fish species in the Mediterranean Sea: Over a century of invasion reconstructed
With over a thousand of introduced species, the Mediterranean is the most heavily invaded marine region in the world. Yet, the spatio-temporal dynamics of this bioinvasion has never been analysed. Examination of a comprehensive dataset of 4015 georeferenced observations, extracted from the scientific literature, allowed (i) reconstructing the invasion and the introduction and post-introduction dynamics of exotic fish species, (ii) calculating introduction and spread rates, and (iii) investigating the time correlates since introduction. Our analysis encompasses 188 fish species that entered the Mediterranean from 1896 to 2020, including 25 Atlantic species that naturally expanded their range through the Strait of Gibraltar. Cumulative occurrences, reported in 264 distribution maps, documented the progressive expansion of the most represented species and the spatio-temporal patterns associated with three introduction routes: the Suez Canal (CAN); other human-mediated vectors (HM) and the Strait of Gibraltar (NRE). The arrival rate of the species introduced through all three routes increased steeply after 1990, without a sign of saturation. Data analysis highlighted some temporal and geographical patterns, such as the effect and eventual weakening of the biogeographical barriers represented by the Strait of Sicily and the North Aegean Sea and the asymmetrical distribution of occurrences along the northern and southern Mediterranean coasts. Finally, there was an exponential increase in the secondary spread rates of CAN and NRE immigrants, as the more recent introductions achieved the fastest geographical expansions. Our findings provide a detailed and spatially explicit summary of a massive invasion that has changed the history of the Mediterranean biota and represent a remarkable example of rapid biotic homogenization in the global ocean.
