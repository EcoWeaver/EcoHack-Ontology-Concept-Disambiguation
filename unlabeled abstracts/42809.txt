Population dynamics of invasive species of smelt Osmerus eperlanus in lake Syamozero (South Karelia)
Ways of penetration of a new species of European smelt Osmerus eperlanus into the Syamozero as well as the process of formation of its population in the reservoir are considered. The main factor contributing to the consolidation of the species in the biotic community is the availability of resources that are not disposed by native species. The regulator of abundance of smelt in the Syamozero is the microsporidium Glugea hertwigi. The role of smelt in the system of established food relationships in the ecosystem is analyzed.
