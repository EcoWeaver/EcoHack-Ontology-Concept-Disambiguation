Management of Hydrocotyle ranunculoides L.f., an aquatic invasive weed of urban waterways in Western Australia
Hydrocotyle ranunculoides L.f. is a stoloniferous perennial plant with floating and emergent leaves that is native to Europe. It is commonly used as an aquarium plant with little published information on its biology and natural range. In 1983 H. ranunculoides was first observed in the urban drainage network in the Canning River Regional Park, Western Australia. By 1991 the plant had extended throughout the drainage network into the river and adjacent wetlands. H. ranunculoides formed extensive mats, disrupting the ecology and recreational uses of the waterways, and posed a threat to other waterways. It is not known to be invasive in other Australian waterways. A group of state and local government and community members assessed environmental, technical and social interactions and developed an integrated managementstrategy for the weed, using a combination of physical, chemical and ecological techniques. The environmental significance of the affected waterways required the programme to be accompanied by appropriate ecological surveillance. The initial short-term control phase was completed successfully. An assessment of water quality and aquatic invertebrates during the initial phase showed only short-term disruption of river ecology following physical and chemical control. The long-term eradication phase is on-going.
