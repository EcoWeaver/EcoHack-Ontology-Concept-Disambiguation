Invasive predatory crayfish do not trigger inducible defences in tadpoles
Invasive species cause deep impacts on ecosystems worldwide, contributing to the decline and extinction of indigenous species. Effective defences against native biological threats in indigenous species, whether structural or inducible, often seem inoperative against invasive species. Here, we show that tadpoles of the Iberian green frog detect chemical cues from indigenous predators (dragonfly nymphs) and respond by reducing their activity and developing an efficient defensive morphology against them (increased tail depth and pigmentation). Those defensive responses, however, were not activated against a highly damaging invasive predator (red swamp crayfish). Induced defences increased tadpole survival when faced against either indigenous dragonflies or invasive crayfish, so its inactivation in the presence of the invasive predator seems to be due to failure in cue recognition. Furthermore, we tested for local adaptation to the invasive predator by comparing individuals from ponds either exposed to or free from crayfish. In both cases, tadpoles failed to express inducible defences against crayfish, indicating that ca 30 years of contact with the invasive species (roughly 10-15 frog generations) have been insufficient for the evolution of recognition of invasive predator cues.
