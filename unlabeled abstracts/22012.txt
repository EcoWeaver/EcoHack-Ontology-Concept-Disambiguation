The role of trust in public attitudes toward invasive species management on Guam: A case study
Public attitudes toward invasive alien species management and trust in managers' ability to effectively manage non-native species can determine public support for conservation action. The island of Guam has experienced widespread species loss and ecosystem transformation due to invasive species, most notably, the brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis). Despite Guam's long history with invasives and extensive efforts to eradicate them, we know little about the sociological context of invasive species and drivers of public support or opposition on the island. Using focused group discussions, we explore public attitudes toward invasive species management measures. Respondents were familiar with the common invasive species on Guam and recognized that they were not native. They expressed support for management activities, interest in more effective and frequent management initiatives, and desire to participate directly in conservation actions. Participants also expressed frustration with government institutions and lack of confidence in managers' ability to control invasive species. Perceptions of managers' trustworthiness, communication with managers, and positive personal experiences with managers were related to positive attitudes about management and support for existing initiatives, indicating the important role of trust and engagement for invasive species management.
