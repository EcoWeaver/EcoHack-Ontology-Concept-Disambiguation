The ecological perspective of microbial communities in two pairs of competitive Hawaiian native and invasive macroalgae
Marine macroalgae are known to harbor large populations of microbial symbionts, and yet, microbe symbiosis in invasive macroalgae remains largely unknown. In this study, we applied molecular methods to study microbial communities associated with two invasive algae Acanthophora spicifera and Gracilaria salicornia and the two native algae Gracilaria coronopifolia and Laurencia nidifica at spatial and temporal scales in Hawaiian coral reef ecosystems. Bacterial communities of both the invasive and native macroalgae displayed little spatial and temporal variations, suggesting consistent and stable bacterial associations with these macroalgae. Results of this study identified three types of bacterial populations: nonspecific (present in both algal and water samples); algae-specific (found in all algal species); and species-specific (only found in individual species). The bacterial diversity of invasive algae was lower than that of their native counterparts at phylum and species levels. Notably, the vast majority (71 %) of bacterial communities associated with the invasive algae G. salicornia were representatives of Cyanobacteria, suggesting a potential ecological significance of symbiotic Cyanobacteria.
