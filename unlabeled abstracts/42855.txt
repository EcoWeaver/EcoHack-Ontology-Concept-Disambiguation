Modeling the Dynamics of Complex Spatial Systems Using GIS, Cellular Automata and Fuzzy Sets Applied to Invasive Plant Species Propagation
Geographic processes are embedded within complex spatial systems containing multiple interacting variables. These processes have spatial and temporal dynamics that are difficult to represent and model with the standard tools of geographic information systems (GIS) software. Consequently, representing the dynamics of geographic process and accounting for uncertainties in variable measurements are key considerations when developing realistic spatial models. This article discusses an integrated GIS-based cellular automata (CA) design that addresses spatial and temporal dynamics representation, and incorporates fuzzy sets for handling input spatial data uncertainties and errors. The integrated approach is demonstrated in the context of modeling the dynamics of invasive plant species in a simulated landscape. Using dynamic models as predictive tools can enable more targeted spatial decision making especially when resources are limited. In the case of invasive species, the GIS-CA model can be used to predict species locations for improved control and management strategies.
