Fire modulates the effects of introduced ungulates on plant-insect interactions in a Patagonian temperate forest
Disturbances like biological invasions and fire may affect in unexpected ways plant-animal interactions. In northwestern Patagonia, introduced ungulates (cattle, horses and deers) are widespread and very common occupying more than 50% of forests and shrublands, widely affecting these habitats. In addition, fire play a major role in creating landscape patterns in this region. We evaluated whether fire modify the impacts of introduced ungulates on plant-animal interactions. In a mature forest (unburnt) and in an early post-fire area (burnt) we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyzed the impacts of introduced ungulates on insect herbivory, pollination and pre-dispersal seed predation on Berberis darwinii, one of the most common understory shrub of temperate forests. We found that the effects of cattle on pollination and fruit set depended on the habitat condition (i.e. unburnt or burnt). Introduced ungulates in unburnt forest decreased fruit set through a reduction on pollinator visits. Conversely, introduced ungulates in burnt forest increased pollinator visits and flower production without affecting fruit set. On the other hand, damage patterns (herbivory and fruit/seed predation) were unaffected by cattle in both forests types. Either, low browsing pressure or induction of plant defences may explain our results. This study illustrates how modifications on biotic and abiotic conditions produced by fire may affect in complex ways the effect of introduced ungulates on plant-animal interactions.
