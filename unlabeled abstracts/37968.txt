Invasive freshwater molluscs are consumed by native fishes in South America
The diet of seven fish species from the Rio de la Plata was studied to evaluate their behaviour as predators on the invasive bivalves Corbicula fluminea and Limnoperna fortunei. It was concluded that the teleosts Pterodoras granulosus, Pimelodus maculatus, Paraloricaria vetula and Ricola macrops prey upon C. fluminea, whilst Leporinus obtusidens, Rhinodoras dorbignyi and Brochiloricaria chauliodon feed on Lim. fortunei. These fish species had altered their diets to consume large amounts of these molluscs. Three of the fishes recorded here were previously unknown to feed on molluscs. The fishes studied here prey upon molluscs that ingest trace metals with their food items, thus monitoring the situation is suggested as several of these fish species are caught for human consumption.
