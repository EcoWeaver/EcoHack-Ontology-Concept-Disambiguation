Diet of the invasive piscivorous fish Fistularia commersonii in a recently colonized area of the eastern Mediterranean
The composition of the diet of the Indo-Pacific cornetfish Fistularia commersonii from the SE Aegean Sea is described. The stomach contents of 245 specimens collected between September 2004 and March 2005 were examined. Dietary comparisons were made reflecting the relationship between diet composi-tion, time of year, and fish size. Correlation between predator length and prey length was significant. The diet of the blue cornetfish consists of 96% by number and 99.95% by weight of fish. Size classification and habitat of prey groups (benthic, supra-benthic, and pelagic) showed that with increased body length the blue cornetfish extended its diet to larger prey and more gener-alist feeding. Spicara smaris, Boops boops, and Mullidae spp. were the most abundant prey by weight whereas a variety of small benthic fish (especially gobiids) and newly hatched fish con-stituted the largest number of prey items. Length- weight relationships for the cornetfish were investigated.
