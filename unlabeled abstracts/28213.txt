Combination of label-free quantitative proteomics and transcriptomics reveals intraspecific venom variation between the two strains of Tetrastichus brontispae, a parasitoid of two invasive beetles
The venom apparatus is a conserved organ in parasitoids that shows adaptations correlated with life-style diversification. Combining transcriptomics and label-free quantitative proteomics, here we explored the venom apparatus components of the endoparasitoid Tetrastichus brontispae (Eulophidae), and provide a comparison of the venom apparatus proteomes between its two closely related strains, T. brontispae-Octodonta nipae (Tb-On) and T. brontispae-Brontispa longissima (Tb-Bl). Tb-Bl targets the B. longissima pupa as its habitual host. However, Tb-On is an experimental derivative of Tb-Bl, which has been exposed to the O. nipae pupa as host consecutively for over 40 generation. Results showed that approximately 1505 venom proteins were identified in the T. brontispae venom apparatus. The extracts contained novel venom proteins, such as 4-coumarate-CoA ligase 4. A comparative venom proteome analysis revealed that significant quantitative and qualitative differences in venom composition exist between the two strains; although the most abundant venom proteins were shared between them. The differentially produced proteins were mainly enriched in fatty acid biosynthesis and melanotic encapsulation response. Six of these enriched proteins presented increased levels in Tb-On, and this result was validated by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis. Overall, our data reveal that venom composition can evolve quickly and respond to host selection.
