Macroinvertebrate metrics and their integration for assessing the ecological status and biocontamination of Lithuanian lakes
We present an assessment system for determining the ecological status (eutrophication and land use pressures) and non-indigenous macroinvertebrate species (NIMS) specific deviation from naturalness of Lithuanian lakes, using semi-quantitative sampling of littoral macroinvertebrates. This system includes two integrated indices, the multimetric Lithuanian Lake Macroinvertebrate Index (LLMI) and the Fauna Autochthony Index (FAI). The LLMI, developed for the assessment of ecological status, averages four metrics: the conventional Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) and the first Hill's number (H1), as well as the newly validated number of Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera taxa (#CEP) and the proportion of Coleoptera, Odonata and Plecoptera individuals (COP). Furthermore, the metrics of biocontamination were transformed into the WFD-compliant FAI for the NIMS-specific naturalness evaluation.
