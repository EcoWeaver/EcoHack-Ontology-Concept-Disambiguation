Community and population impacts of an introduced meiofauna (Nippoleucon hinumensis) upon an intertidal infaunal community and its closest endemic analog (Cumella vulgaris)
and abiotic (tolerance) variables in structuring the infaunal community. We identified a significant negative correlation between N. hinumensis and C. vulgaris, suggesting that when placed in context with other structuring factors, the introduced species may have a minor, but detectable impact upon C. vulgaris populations. However, no relationship was observed between N. hinumensis and the infaunal community. The lack of a community-wide effect is potentially the result of the similarity between N. hinumensis and C. vulgaris life history strategies, enabling the introduced species to effectively replace C. vulgaris in the food web. As such, N. hinumensis may be best described as an invasive species, and not as merely non-native. Furthermore, the analytical techniques used here can be applied to other ecological systems to quantify and compare the impact of introduced species against other structuring forces.
