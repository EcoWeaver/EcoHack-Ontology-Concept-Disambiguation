Evidence for recent evolution in an invasive species,Microstegium vimineum, Japanese stiltgrass
The establishment and spread of invasive plants are often associated with a 'general-purpose genotype', with a corresponding high degree of phenotypic plasticity when introduced to a new environment. Evolutionary potential of invasive species following introduction should also be considered, however, as such changes can facilitate rapid range expansion. In this study, we utilised seed from three geographically distinct mid-Atlantic populations of an invasive species, Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass), to assess whether populations varied in their biomass and reproductive responses to light and nitrogen under neutral glasshouse conditions. To assess evolutionary adaptation, we quantified and correlated the abiotic environment from each collection location with the final biomass and seed production of that population under common glasshouse conditions. For M. vimineum, growth and reproductive responses to a common set of abiotic parameters (e.g. light) under these conditions indicated considerable phenotypic variation between and within populations. Interestingly, the degree of variation of seed production and final biomass among populations in the glasshouse was strongly correlated with growing season length and cumulative degree days recorded near each population location. These latter data indicated that M. vimineum, introduced into this region <100 years ago, may be undergoing adaptive evolution. Although additional populations of M. vimineum need to be examined, this study suggests that local evolutionary adaptation may be occurring rapidly and could, potentially, be an important aspect in the establishment and spread of this invasive species.
