Different life-histories of native and invasiveNeogobius melanostomusand the possible role of phenotypic plasticity in the species' invasion success
One of the most successful invasive fish species with negative impacts is round goby Neogobius melanostomus that has spread from its original Ponto-Caspian area to west and central Europe and even to North America. Previous studies focused on invasive fishes have revealed that these species have the capability to generate forms with life-history traits that differ between native and non-native populations. As a contribution to explain their invasion success, the theory of alternative ontogenies and invasive potential has been developed. The main aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis derived from this theory, which predicts that females of the non-native population of N. melanostomus (from Slovakia) will have significantly smaller oocytes, higher fecundity and smaller body size at maturity than those of the native population (from Bulgaria). All the three quantitative parameters of life-history traits examined in this study were found to be consistent with the predictions tested. Variations in reproductive parameters observed in non-native N. melanostomus demonstrate the species' phenotypic plasticity, which appears to be an important attribute that helps potential invaders to establish new populations in unknown environments. However, further experimental studies are necessary to verify this theory by testing hypotheses derived from it.
