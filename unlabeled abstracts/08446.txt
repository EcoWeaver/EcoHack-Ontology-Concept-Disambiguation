Respiration-based monitoring of metabolic rate following cold-exposure in two invasive Anoplophora species depending on acclimation regime
The Asian and Citrus longhorned beetles, Anoplophora glabripennis (ALB) and A. chinensis (CLB) respectively, are two closely related invasive species with overlapping native ranges. Although both species have rather similar biological characteristics, they differ in their invasion patterns. ALB shows numerous, but local, outbreaks in urban areas of North-East America, Western and Central Europe, whereas CLB has colonized a large part of Northern Italy. Temperature is pivotal in setting distribution limits of ectotherms. Low temperature may be limiting for larvae since they are the main overwintering stage for both species. To investigate whether differential cold tolerance may contribute to setting the respective limits of the range invaded by each species, we monitored larval metabolic rate before and after exposure to a one-week ecologically relevant moderate cold stress (- 2/+2 degC, 14/10 h). We tested two distinctive fluctuating regimes before the cold exposure to check whether larval acclimation significantly altered their cold tolerance. Survival was high in all conditions for both species. Visual examination showed temporary locomotor inactivity during the stress but respiration rates were not altered after the stress suggesting that larvae could rapidly resume their initial metabolic activity. The respiration rate was globally higher in ALB than in CLB. Together, these results tend to indicate that both species have similar tolerance to the moderate cold stress tested, but also that ALB may be better at maintaining metabolic activity at cold than CLB. These observed differences could affect phenology in both species and in turn their establishment potential.
