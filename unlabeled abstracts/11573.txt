Southeast Asian invasive birds: ecology, impact and management
Invasive birds can have serious impacts on native biodiversity, native ecosystems and humans. However, there is a dearth of literature on the status and effects of invasive birds in Southeast Asia. We review the current available information on the invasive bird species in Southeast Asia, first by discussing characteristics that likely make invasive bird species successful and second by reviewing the impacts of the invasive bird species on Southeast Asian economy and biodiversity. We end by discussing the strengths and weaknesses, as well as the applicability of different management options.
