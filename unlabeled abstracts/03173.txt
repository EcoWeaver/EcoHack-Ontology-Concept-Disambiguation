A spatial mismatch between invader impacts and research publications
Geographic research biases are widespread in conservation biology and ecology. Although most researchers will probably agree to this statement, there are relatively few studies on geographic biases (but see Martin et al. 2012), and their management implications are rarely discussed. We would like to shed some light on this issue with a focus on biological invasions, where research has increased rapidly during recent decades. This article is protected by copyright.
