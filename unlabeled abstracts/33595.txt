GOPHER-PLANT-FUNGAL INTERACTIONS AFFECT ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INVASIVE GRASS
Many attempts have been made to link invasions of exotic plants to specific plant traits and key attributes of invaded ecosystems. While these factors play a role in determining the potential for invasion, they are often inadequate in predicting the success of a specific invasion. We show that interactions of an invasive grass with other members of the community determine the local pattern of invasion. A fungus, Ulocladium atrum, aids the establishment of barbed goatgrass (Aegilops triuncialis) by weakening the grass's tough seed head, thereby accelerating germination and seedling establishment. In contrast, gophers, Thomomys bottae, decrease establishment of this invader by selectively burying patches of goatgrass seedlings under mounds. Plants that survive these gopher disturbances produce seeds that are uninfected by Ulocladium atrum, which may further decrease the establishment of the next generation of goatgrass. A field survey indicated that goatgrass achieves dominance in areas with minimal gopher disturbance, but has limited establishment in pastures with high gopher activity, indicating that the landscape pattern of gopher activity influences patterns of goatgrass invasion by manipulating gopher-plant-fungal interactions.
