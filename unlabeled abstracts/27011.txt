Demography and management of the invasive plant species Hypericum perforatum. I. Using multi-level mixed-effects models for characterizing growth, survival and fecundity in a long-term data set
Details of the insects known to attack H. perforatum in its exotic range are given in Campbell, Briese & Delfosse (1995). They fall into two groups: those that are polyphagous native or accidentally introduced species, and a group of introduced, host-specific biocontrol agents. Since the 1930s, 12 biocontrol agents have been released in Australia, although only the beetle Chrysolina quadrigemina (Suffr.) is considered to have had any significant impacts on the weed. Chrysolina quadrigemina sporadically reduces the extent of infestations in years where defoliation by the beetle is high, but it cannot reduce populations of H. perforatum to acceptable levels by itself (Briese 1985). It is also of limited use in natural ecosystems because it is intolerant of shade such as that found under native Eucalyptus woodland. Currently under observation are a species of mite Aculus hyperici (Liro) and the root borer Agrilus hyperici (Creutzer). Populations of the mite have established widely and cause some reduction in plant biomass, while the root borer has failed to establish in adequate numbers in Australia (Briese 1997a). Hypericum perforatum is poisonous to livestock, causing photosensitization, loss of condition and ultimately death if animals continue to feed on it (Bourke 1997). Careful grazing management, however, is often successfully used to control the weed (Campbell, Briese & Delfosse 1995) and goats are considered to be more tolerant of H. perforatum grazing than other stock (R. Arnott, personal communication).
