Biological invasions in forest ecosystems: a global problem requiring international and multidisciplinary integration
The world's forests are crucial biological resources that provide a variety of ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling and provisioning of resources to society. But forests are particularly affected by biological invasions, with regions around the world experiencing invasions by species from virtually every kingdom. Many of these species have severely disrupted forest ecosystem processes, thereby interrupting the provisioning of ecosystem services that societies depend upon. The problem of biological invasion in forests has many facets, and a large diversity of scientific disciplines addresses these issues. To make progress in solving the problems forest invasions pose, developing interdisciplinary collaborations is crucial because the causes of invasions and many of the measures for prevention or management require expertise in biology, economics, and social sciences. The goal of this special issue is to compile a series of articles summarizing various biological, sociological, and policy subject areas associated with forest invasions from a global perspective. These papers were prepared by the task force, "Forests and Biological Invasions," organized by the International Union of Forest Research Organizations. Publication of this special issue is intended to advance the integration of scientific knowledge and development of solutions to this very serious and growing problem.
