Modelling the invasion of a Central American Mimosoid tree species (Leucaena leucocephala) in a tropical coastal region of Taiwan
Assessing the progress of alien plant invasion is pivotal for weed management. In this study, we develop a spatially explicit logistic regression imbedded cellular automaton (CA)-based species expansion model to estimate the invasion of a Central American Mimosoid tree Leucaena leucocephala (LELE) in a tropical coastal region of Taiwan. We delineated the LELE infested areas in 1988, 1997 and 2007 using the Satellite Pour L'observation de la Terre (SPOT), and refined the classifications using high spatial resolution aerial photographs or Formosat-2 satellite images (Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research, Taiwan). Dynamics of LELE by referring to 1988-1997 LELE spatial distributions were ingested into a logistic model to build transition rules for CA simulation. The results showed that the enhanced CA model can precisely (95% overall accuracy by comparing with the 2007 LELE distribution) model the population expansion of LELE. This study highlights the strength of this spatially explicit predictive model, and sheds the light on the management of alien invasive species management.
