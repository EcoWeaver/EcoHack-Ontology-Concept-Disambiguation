The germination success of Acacia longifolia subsp. longifolia (Fabaceae): a comparison between its native and exotic ranges
Acacia longifolia subsp. longifolia is native to South-eastern Australia and has naturalised in many regions across the globe, including in Portugal, Spain, and South Africa invading extensive areas. Prolific seed production and a long-lived seedbank are considered key factors that enhance its invasiveness. Yet, the effects of different factors on germination are still underexplored. Seeds were collected from Portuguese and Australian populations, and germination was evaluated under different temperature regimes, photoperiods, pH levels, salt stress, osmotic potential and burial depths. Findings show both populations share some similar patterns but also reveal important differences related to their germination. Higher temperatures induce increased germination rates while the photoperiod has no effect on germination. Both populations had quicker seed emergence under dark conditions. Seeds from both populations decrease germination rate under increasing salt-stress and show a wide range of pH tolerance, but Australians seeds are more tolerant to increase of both parameters. Seeds from the Portuguese population are bigger and germinated from deeper depths than the Australian. Our results may provide information to improve management of this species seedbank. Germination can prevent by, tillage or other interventions that help to increase burial depths; adding lime (to increase the soil alkalinity) can reduce its germination rate in both geographical ranges.
