Comment on "Climatic Niche Shifts Are Rare Among Terrestrial Plant Invaders"
Petitpierre et al . (Reports, 16 March 2012, p. 1344) conclude that niche shifts are rare for terrestrial plant invaders and that this justifies the use of correlative modeling to project species geographic ranges for biological invasions and climate change. We draw attention to the limitations of their conceptual assumptions and the importance of niche shifts excluded from their analyses.
