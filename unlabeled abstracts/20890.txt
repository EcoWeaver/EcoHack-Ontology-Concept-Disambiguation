A new coral species introduced into the Atlantic Ocean - Tubastraea micranthus (Ehrenberg 1834) (Cnidaria, Anthozoa, Scleractinia): An invasive threat?
Over the past 60-70 years, the invasive Indo-Pacific coral Tubastraea coccinea (Lesson 1830; Cnidaria, Scleractinia) has colonized the western tropical Atlantic Ocean -the Americas, the Antilles, northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM), and many of its 3,600 oil/gas platforms. It is now the single, most abundant coral on artificial substrata in the GOM, with hundreds of thousands of colonies on a single platform. Here, we report for the first time the observation of a closely related congener in the western Atlantic - the Indo-Pacific azooxanthellate Tubastraea micranthus (Ehrenberg 1834) - and suggest that it may pose a threat similar to T. coccinea. A total of 83 platforms, including deep-water, toppled, Rigs-to-Reefs structures, were surveyed in the northern Gulf of Mexico between 2000 and 2009, from Matagorda Island, Texas to Mobile, Alabama, USA, between the depths of 7 and 37 m, by SCUBA divers. Five platforms were surveyed by Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) to depths of up to 117 m. T. micranthus was found on only one platform - Grand Isle 93 (GI-93), off Port Fourchon, Louisiana, near the Mississippi River mouth, at the cross-roads of two major safety fairways/shipping lanes transited by large international commercial ships. The introduction appears to be recent, probably derived from the ballast water or hull of a vessel from the Indo-Pacific. If the growth and reproductive rates of T. micranthus, both sexual and asexual, are similar to those of T. coccinea, this species could dominate this region like its congener. It is not known whether this species is an opportunist/pioneer species, like T. coccinea, a trait protecting benthic communities from its dominance. The question of rapid-response eradication is raised.
