Comment on: Grazing disturbance promotes exotic annual grasses by degrading soil biocrust communities
Biological soil crusts (hereafter, biocrusts) are a critical component of many semiarid ecosystems because they seriously affect seed germination, soil stability, fertility, and hydrology (Belnap 2003). These factors are central to ecosystem recovery following soil-plant disturbances such as increased wildfire or livestock grazing. Livestock grazing is the primary land use of semiarid landscapes globally, and the impacts of hooved animals on both soils and plant community condition, including exotic plant invasions, have been recognized for over a century (Samson and Weyl 1918, Daubenmire 1940).
