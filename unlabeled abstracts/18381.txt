Prey capture and caste-specific payload capacities in the European paper wasp Polistes dominulus
Here, we present a detailed ethogram for the foraging behavior of the eusocial paper wasp, Polistes domi-nulus. The animal's foraging process can be sub-divided into four main stages: (1) approach, (2) attack, (3) butchering, and (4) balling. Although considerable behavioral variation exists within each stage, an analysis of more than 20 individual foraging bouts reveals a single ''common path'' leading from prey approach to its transportation back to the nest; eluci-dating this path and separating it into distinct stages is useful when identifying targets for future ethological studies. Of particular interest here is the balling phase, i.e., the prepara-tion of a bolus of flesh for transportation back to the colony. Using an experimental approach, we show that foundresses can carry significantly heavier payloads than workers, sug-gesting a foraging advantage during the initial stages of colony development. We also show that wasp body mass is significantly positively correlated with payload capacity in foundresses, a relationship not seen among workers or late reproductives. This correlation suggests a beneficial adapta-tion of foundresses for combating early season pressures associated with the foundation of a new colony.
