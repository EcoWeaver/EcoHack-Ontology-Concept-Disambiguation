Population genetics of goldspotted oak borer, Agrilus auroguttatus Schaeffer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae): investigating the origin of an invasive pest of native oaks in California
The goldspotted oak borer, Agrilus auroguttatus Schaeffer, is an invasive woodborer in California USA that is native to oak woodlands across southern Arizona USA. Developing a classical biological control program for this pest in southern California is a high priority due to the continuing ecological and economic damage caused by this insect since its recent introduction into the area. In an attempt to determine the area of origin for this invasive beetle, analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and ribosomal nuclear D2 domain of the 28S gene regions were undertaken and provided insight into the phylogeographic relationship between and within populations of A. auroguttatus in Arizona and California. The area of origin for the invasive population of goldspotted oak borer in California was not determined conclusively, although our molecular data suggests the Dragoon Mountains in Cochise Co., Arizona as a possible source for the California population of A. auroguttatus. Results also confirmed that individuals collected from populations across southern Arizona and California are all A. auroguttatus, and are not part of a cryptic species complex comprised of the morphologically similar A. coxalis. Future surveys for natural enemies of A. auroguttatus will focus on the Dragoon Mountains as a potential source for co-evolved enemies for use in a classical biological control program against this invasive woodborer in southern California.
