First records of an invasive bug in Europe : Halyomorpha halys Stal (Heteroptera : Pentatomidae), a new pest on woody ornamentals and fruit trees?
In 2007 five incidences of the brown marmorated stink bug Halyomorpha halys Stal 1855 (Hetero-ptera: Pentatomidae) were recorded from the area around the City of Zurich in Switzerland. While most records were of single individuals, in one case exotic ornamentals suffered from a mass attack. These are the first records of this invasive bug not just in Switzerland but also in Europe. This phyto-phagous species is native to East Asia and was introduced into the USA about a decade ago. It is con-sidered a pest both in its countries of origin and introduction, especially for horticultural crops such as stone fruit and pomes as well as for woody ornamentals. Moreover, it can become a nuisance in residential areas when it aggregates on buildings and in homes seeking shelter for overwintering. A brief literature review is given here of its biology, host plants, natural enemies and eco-nomic impact in East Asia and in the USA. The possible significance of this new potential pest in Central Europe is also assessed.
