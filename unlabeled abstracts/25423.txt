Alien marine macrophytes in Greece: a review
By October 2007, a total of 31 alien marine macrophytic species had been recorded on Greek coasts. Following a critical review of these findings, these species were classified as established (9 species), casual (8 species) and debatable (14 species). There were also 23 species found in the Greek marine flora that are excluded from the list of alien macroalgae. Brief remarks are provided for the debatable species. Based on the distribution of the alien species, four are considered as invasive, although their impact on the native vegetation has not yet been documented. A trend analysis revealed that most alien species (65% of current total) were found in the period 1971-2007. Shipping contributes to most alien macroalgal immigration (48%), followed by progressive immigration via the Suez Canal (33%), while aquaculture plays a minor role (16%), unlike the western Mediterranean Sea where aquaculture accounts for 73% of the macrophyte introductions.
