Life history and host range of the leaf blotcherEucosmophora schinusivora: a candidate for biological control ofSchinus terebinthifoliusin the USA
The host range of Eucosmophora schinusivora Davis & Wheeler (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) was studied to assess its suitability as a biological control agent of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (Anacardiaceae), a serious environmental and agricultural weed in the USA and elsewhere in the world. The life history of this insect species and its host range were determined in the laboratory with adult no-choice oviposition and larval development tests. This species has five instars, the first three are sap feeding miners and the last two are tissue feeding. Total development time was 31.7 days. To examine specificity of this species, ten plant species in Anacardiaceae were selected based on taxonomic relatedness to S. terebinthifolius, economic importance, and availability. In the laboratory, except for Anacardium occidentale and Cotinus obovatus, all of the tested species were accepted for oviposition with a marked preference for the weed S. terebinthifolius, Schinus molle, Rhus copallinum, R. sandwicensis, and Pistacia chinensis. Complete development, from egg to adult, was achieved only on S. terebinthifolius, S. molle, R. copallinum, P. chinensis, and M. toxiferum. In conclusion, E. schinusivora will not be considered for the biological control of S. terebinthifolius in the continental U.S. However, the utilization of this species in other infested areas such as Hawai'i and Australia should be considered.
