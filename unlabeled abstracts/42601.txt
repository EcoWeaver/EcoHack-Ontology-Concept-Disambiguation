Three new alien Chenopodiaceae species in the flora of Russia
Three new alien species of Chenopodiaceae s. str. (Amaranthaceae s. l.) are reported for the flora of Russia, the North American Chenopodiastrum simplex and Australian Dysphania carinata and D. pumilio. The identification of the specimens of Chenopodiastrum simplex from Moschny Island in the Leningrad Region (European Russia) was confirmed using both morphological and phylogenetic analyses. Morphologically, C. simplex is very similar to C. badachschanicum having the same fruit and seed characters. A single specimen of Dysphania carinata from Primorye Territory (the Russian Far East) was previously identified as Chenopodium pumilio ( Dysphania pumilio) incorrectly. Only recently, the latter species has been indeed found in Beslan town, Republic of North Ossetia - Alania (the North Caucasus). For each species, the possible degree of naturalization is discussed.
