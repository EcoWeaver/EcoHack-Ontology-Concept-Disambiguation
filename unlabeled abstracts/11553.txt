Equal diversity in disparate species assemblages: a comparison of native and exotic woodlands in California
The species richness of ecosystems can remain stable over time, despite changes in species composition and changes in the dominant plant species. While this pattern of stability is known to occur temporally, it has been examined poorly in a spatial context. To examine this spatially, the species richness, diversity and composition of native woodlands (of oak and bay trees) and exotic woodlands (of eucalypt trees) were compared in California. Species richness was nearly identical for understorey plants, leaf-litter invertebrates, amphibians and birds; only rodents had significantly fewer species in eucalypt sites. Species diversity patterns (using the Shannon-Wiener Index) were qualitatively identical to those for species richness, except for leaf-litter invertebrates, which were significantly more diverse in eucalypt sites during the spring. Species composition was different between sites, as evidenced by a principal components analysis, coefficients of similarity, and the relatively few species shared between native and eucalypt sites. Thus, the consistency in richness and diversity observed for most groups, in most seasons, occurred despite significant differences in species composition. These results are consistent with previous demonstrations of temporal stability, suggesting that species richness may often be stable, both temporally and spatially, despite changes in composition and regardless of the dominant vegetation.
