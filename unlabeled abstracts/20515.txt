Variability and grouping of leaf traits in multi-species reforestation (Leyte, Philippines)
Conventional reforestation in the tropics often results in stands with low tree species and functional diversities. A different approach to reforestation, the so-called rainforestation, has been developed in the Philippines. It emphasizes mixed stands and the preferential use of native species supplemented by fruit trees. In such stands, we studied several functional leaf traits (stomatal conductance for water vapour, leaf morphology and chemistry) with the objectives (1) of assessing the species-specific variation of leaf traits and in particular that of maximal leaf stomatal conductance (gsmax), (2) of determining relationships between gsmax and other tree variables, and (3) of assessing whether leaf traits group the species studied. Sixteen broad-leaved species were studied, using five individual trees per species and ten fully expanded sunlit leaves per individual tree. Species-specific gsmax differed fivefold (165-772mmolm-2s-1). Among studied leaf traits, only the carbon isotope ratio d13C exhibited a simple linear correlation with gsmax. A separate analysis for dipterocarp species indicated a strong negative relationship between gsmax and specific leaf area (SLA) (r2=0.96, P
