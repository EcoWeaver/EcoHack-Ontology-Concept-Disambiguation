Challenges of dehydration result in a behavioral shift in invasive toads
Invasion success is associated with behavioral and physiological adaptations of invasive species. For anuran species invading xeric habitats, the ability to find water is an important behavioral trait. Using a labyrinth experiment and toads (Sclerophrys gutturalis) dehydrated at different levels, we observed that individuals invading a hydric challenging habitat showed advantageous water-conservation behaviors (e.g., taking longer to engage in water-searching behavior and spent more time close to the water source after finding it) compared to toads from the native range. Transdermal treatment with corticosterone, a hormone that increases its plasma concentrations under dehydration, increased success of finding water in 100% hydrated animals. Our results indicate that, compared to the native population, invasive toads display water-conservation behaviors that might improve survival rates in a novel xeric environment and that experimental corticosterone elevation modulates this water-finding behavior.
