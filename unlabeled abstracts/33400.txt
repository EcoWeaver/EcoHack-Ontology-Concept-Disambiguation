Expansion of the invasive Pseudorasbora parva (Cyprinidae) in the Iberian Peninsula : first record in the Guadiana River basin
Pseudorasbora parva (Temminck & Schlegel, 1846) has become an invasive fish in many parts of Europe. In the Iberian Peninsula, until now, P. parva has been recorded only from the Ebro and Ter Rivers, NE Spain. The first record in the Guadiana River basin (SW Spain) of P. parva is reported. The origin of the population is presumably an accidental introduction from a local fish farm. P. parva represents a new threat to the native fish in the Guadiana River basin where other 12 exotic species are already present. An eradication programme should be performed to stop further dispersal in the Guadiana basin and other Iberian rivers.
