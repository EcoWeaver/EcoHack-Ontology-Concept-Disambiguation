The predatory behaviour of a tramp ant species in its native range.
Workers of the pest ant Paratrechina longicornis participate in a type of group hunting. Each individual forages with its long antennae wide open and moves quickly (6.3 cm/s) along an erratic path surrounded by nestmates behaving in the same way and within range of a recruiting pheromone. They detect prey by contact with successful workers singly capturing and retrieving small prey and seizing larger ones by an appendage. Then they recruit nestmates at short-range; all together they spread-eagle the prey and retrieve them whole.
