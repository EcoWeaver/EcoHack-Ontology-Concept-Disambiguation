Ecological Determinants of Wood-Rotting Fungal Diversity and First Report of Favolaschia calocera, an Invasive Species from India
The present investigation was carried out in Phek district, Nagaland, on seasonal basis for a period of 2 years from December 2014 to November 2016. A total of 56 wood-rotting fungi were identified. Among these, Favolaschia calocera R. Heim is reported for the first time from India. It belongs to the family Marasmiaceae. Highest number of wood-rotting fungi and the species abundance were recorded during summer (39 species and 53.45%, respectively). Maximum number of wood-rotting fungi was supported by logs (34 species). Based on decay stages of wood, decay stage III harbored the highest number of wood-rotting fungi (32 species). The number of species occurring on the sapwood and on bark was equal (23 each) and 10 were common to both. The pH and percentage moisture content of the hosts ranged from 2.88 to 6.57 and 10 to 58, respectively. Majority of wood-rotting fungi were collected from hosts growing under light-exposed condition (39 species) than those growing under shaded condition, whereas eight species were found growing under both the conditions. It was observed that species growing under shaded condition preferred later stages of wood decay (decay stages IV and V) and higher moisture content (above 30%), irrespective of the types and pH of the hosts. The present study provides baseline information on the ecology of wood-rotting fungal species.
