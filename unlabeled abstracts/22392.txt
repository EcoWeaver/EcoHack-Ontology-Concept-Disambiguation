Biological invasions and phenotypic evolution: a quantitative genetic perspective
Among the many different components of global environmental change, biological invasions represent the one with the most long-term ecological and evolutionary consequences, as effects are irreversible. Although the ecological impact of invasive species has been under great scrutiny, its evolutionary aspects and consequences have remained less explored. Once established, an important part of the success of an invasive species will depend on the presence of genetic variation in populations at the geographic boundaries upon which natural selection can act. This information is integrated in G, the matrix of additive genetic variances and covariances for a suite of traits. The G-matrix shows the restrictions and potentialities of adaptive evolution and, together with natural selection determine the direction and rate of phenotypic evolution. Here I propose that a geographic analysis of G in populations of the introduced and native range becomes essential to understand critical evolutionary issues associated with invasion success.
