Climate anomalies provide opportunities for large-scale mapping of non-native plant abundance in desert grasslands
Aim Native plant communities are susceptible to climate anomalies, which would favour the invasion of non-native species. However, climate anomalies may also provide opportunities for detecting non-native plants at a regional scale using remote sensing. Based on this mechanism, we propose a direct and effective remote sensing approach to map the abundance of South African Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees (Lehmann lovegrass), a highly invasive, non-native plant in the desert grasslands of southwestern North America.
