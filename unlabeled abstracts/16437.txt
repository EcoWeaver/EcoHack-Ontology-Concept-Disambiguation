Evaluation of a Movie Theater Advertisement Campaign to Promote Behaviors that Prevent Spread of Aquatic Invasive Species
One of the primary causes of the spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS) is boaters and anglers who move between bodies of water. Engaging with recreational boaters and anglers to encourage preventative behaviors is crucial for managing the spread of AIS. The use of cinema advertising for disseminating pro-environmental messages is a relatively novel and understudied outreach strategy. To explore this approach, an AIS-related public service announcement was placed in the preshow advertising at a movie theater in north central Wisconsin. Movie patrons were surveyed as they left the theater to determine demographic, AIS awareness, advertising exposure, and recall information. The results of this study suggest movie theater advertising is a potentially efficacious medium for pro-environmental outreach efforts.
