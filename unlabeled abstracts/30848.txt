First record of the invasive oriental shrimp Palaemon macrodactylus Rathbun, 1902 in France (Gironde Estuary)
During summer 2006, the first specimens of the oriental shrimp Palaemon macrodactylus Rathbun, 1902 were identified in the Gironde Estuary (France). These specimens, which included ovigerous females, are confirmed present throughout a large part of the estuary, in large numbers compared to the local resident shrimp Palaemon longirostris Milne Edwards, 1837. Native to Asia, P. macrodactylus was first introduced in California (USA) in the 1950s, before being detected recently within several European estuaries, e.g. the Guadalquivir Estuary (Spain) and the Orwell Estuary (England). According to these records, P. macrodactylus appears to be a strong invader, able to colonise a wide geographical range.
