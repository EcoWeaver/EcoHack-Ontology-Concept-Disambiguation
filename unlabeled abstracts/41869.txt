Environmental stress determines the colonization and impact of an endophytic fungus on invasive knotweed
AbstractThere is increasing evidence that microbes play a key role in some plant invasions. A diverse and widespread but little understood group of plant-associated microbes are the fungal root endophytes of the order Sebacinales. They are associated with exotic populations of invasive knotweed (Reynoutria ssp.) in Europe, but their effects on the invaders are unknown. We used the recently isolated Sebacinales root endophyte Serendipita herbamans to experimentally inoculate invasive knotweed and study root colonisation and effects on knotweed growth under different environmental conditions. We verified the inoculation success and fungal colonisation through immunofluorescence microscopy and qPCR. We found that S. herbamans strongly colonized invasive knotweed in low-nutrient and shade environments, but much less under drought or benign conditions. At low nutrients, the endophyte had a positive effect on plant growth, whereas the opposite was true under shaded conditions. Our study demonstrates that the root endophyte S. herbamans has the potential to colonize invasive knotweed fine roots and impact its growth, and it could thus also play a role in natural populations. Our results also show that effects of fungal endophytes on plants can be strongly environment-dependent, and may only be visible under stressful environmental conditions.
