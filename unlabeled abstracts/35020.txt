Scrutinizing the enemy release hypothesis: population effects of parasitoids on Harmonia axyridis and local host coccinellids in Brazil
The Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) has been a factor influencing the establishment of some exotic species worldwide. We tested if the ERH could be influencing populations of the exotic predator Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in Brazil. During two years, three local predatory coccinellid species and Harmonia axyridis were sampled in Brassica oleracea in six organic farms in the midwest of the country. Parasitoids were detected by rearing (emerged) and qPCR Melting Curve Analysis (unemerged). Host density-dependence and spillovers were used to evaluate coccinellid population effects of parasitism. Six parasitoid species were found, including two new records for Brazil. Although Harmonia axyridis harbored fewer parasitoid species, parasitism was not lower and parasitoid density-dependence was not weaker on it compared to the local species. Spillovers among hosts occurred both onto Harmonia axyridis and from it. The ERH was rejected for these parasitoids and, therefore, it did not contribute to the invasiveness of Harmonia axyridis in Brazil.
