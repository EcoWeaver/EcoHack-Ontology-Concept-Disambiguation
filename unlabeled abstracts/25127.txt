Effects of human presence on two social wasp species
1. The effects of human presence on the behavioural response and productivity of a native wasp species of North America (Polistes fuscatus) and an invasive wasp species (Polistes dominulus) were examined in a field experiment. Over a 3-month period, colonies of each species were exposed to human presence at either low (biweekly) or high (daily) levels. At 2-week intervals, wasp response to human presence was recorded for all colonies via an index, ranging from no response (0) to an attack (4). 2. The levels of human presence had no effect on wasp response or colony productivity but foundresses of both species increased their response level the closer a human was to the nest. In addition, foundresses of P. fuscatus became more aggressive over time, corresponding to after adult offspring emerged, whereas foundresses of P. dominulus did not change their response level after the emergence of offspring. 3. The adult offspring of P. dominulus responded to human presence at a level similar to that of the foundress, whereas adult offspring of P. fuscatus exhibited a lower response to human presence than that of the foundress. The more distinctive aposematic coloration of P. dominulus may play a role in the behavioural differences between species; it may be more effective in deterring predators, and with the result that leaving the nest to defend it is less often necessary. Accordingly, the less aggressive response to human presence by P. dominulus may contribute to its success as an introduced species in North America.
