Prevalence of Invasive Fall Army Worm Spodoptera Frugiperda (J E Smith) on Organic Maize in Sikkim
Fall army worm (FAW) Spodoptera frugiperda (J E Smith) has been observed invading the north eastern region of India during April 2019 in Mizoram and on maize crop of Namphing GPU, South Sikkim, during May 2019. The detailed survey in the maize growing areas of state revealed the presence of early to fourth instar larvae feeding on the leaves and whorls. The identification was confirmed by morphological characters and DNA barcoding with mtCO1. The study indicated range (8.8 to 71.4%) of FAW infestations on maize. During survey, microbial infection in few larvae, and predatory wasps and spiders as predators were found. This is the first record of FAW on organic maize of Sikkim.
