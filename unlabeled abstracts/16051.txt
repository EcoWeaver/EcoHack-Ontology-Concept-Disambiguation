Impact of changing flood regime on a lakeshore plant community: Long-term observations and individual-based simulation
Disturbance events shape plant communities depending on the disturbance regime as well as on the properties of the species constituting the community. We studied a lakeshore community at Lake Constance, a pre-alpine lake in Central Europe, where disturbance by flooding has a strong impact as the water level is almost not regulated by man. The lakeshore habitats are shaped by annual summer flooding during the vegetation period of plants, with seasonal course and magnitude of water-level fluctuations varying considerably between years. By a combination of field work and modelling we examined (1) whether flooding tolerance and interactions between individuals can explain zonation and species coexistence at lakeshore, (2) how strongly invasive species are affecting habitat specific species, and (3) whether changing flooding regimes due to potential climate changes will affect species composition.
