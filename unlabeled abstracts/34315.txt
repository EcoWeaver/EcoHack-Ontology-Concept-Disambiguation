New conservation opportunities: Using citizen science in monitoring non-native species in Neotropical region
The combination of highly equipped smartphones, with the increased use of social media, has offered a wide database. Given this, citizen science can be used to record and monitor non-native fish fauna, target new samples and collaborate with monitoring occurrences in new areas. We aimed to demonstrate the efficiency of social media in citizen science as a tool to cooperate with monitoring studies of non-native species. Consequently, we determined the occurrence points of S. brasiliensis in the Iguacu River basin, indicating sites of greatest occurrence and analyzing the impact of the invasion on the native fauna of the basin. Files and information available on the YouTube(r) and Facebook(r) media platforms were used as data, was carried out from April 2019 to April 2020. The results were 40 records, 22 videos obtained from Youtube, and seven videos and 11 photos from Facebook, the oldest record was from April 2013, while the largest number of posts was in 2016. Fish records available from online platforms can reveal the occurrence and progressive dispersion of species, in the context of biological invasions, these tools can be of great value in studies that aim to follow the progress of introduced species, contributing by helping to direct new sampling programs and corroborating the occurrence of species in new areas in conjunction with standard monitoring programs. Based on citizen science records, it was possible to update the range of occurrence of the non-native S. brasiliensis in the Iguacu River basin, cooperating with scientific knowledge. Innovative monitoring and control measures are necessary to deal with invasive species, with citizen science proving to be competent for determining the occurrence of species and showing promise in the entire field of ichthyology.
