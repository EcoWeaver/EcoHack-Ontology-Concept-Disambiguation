First account on the occurrence of selected invasive alien vertebrates in Greece
This is the first attempt to outline the occurrence of selected invasive alien vertebrates in Greece, since up to now, there are no " official " or scientific reports except from sporadic sightings and anecdotal stories. Records on the occurrence of: Lithobates catesbeianus, Trachemys scripta (T. s. elegans and T. s. scripta), Neovison vison, Myocastor coypus, Nyctereutes procyonoides and Ondatra zibethicus were requested through a pan-Hellenic survey. According to the results, the coypu (Myocastor coypus) appears to be the most widely distributed of all species, having conquered practically all wetlands of Western and Central Greece with populations exceeding, in most cases, 20 individuals each. On the contrary, there is merely one unconfirmed record of the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) while there were no sightings at all for the muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus). The American mink (Neovison vison) was recorded in the northwestern part of Greece. Regarding the alien herpetofauna, the bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) seems to be still confined in Crete where it was originally introduced, while the red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta) appears mostly in Crete, Attiki prefecture, and a few more places, showing most probably an underestimated distribution.
