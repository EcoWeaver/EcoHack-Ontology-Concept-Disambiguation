The Impact of Temperature on the Northern Distribution Limits of the Introduced Species Fallopia japonica and Impatiens glandulifera in North-West Europe
Climatic correlations have been established for the invasive Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed) and Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam). These two species represent examples of perennial and annual vegetation respectively. In accordance with the model predictions, the northern distribution limit of F. japonica was controlled by two climatic variables (length of growing season, measured in day-degrees, and minimum temperature) while for I. glandulifera only the length of the growing season was critical. Experimental verification of the results is crucial. Using predictions established by climatic correlations, maps have been produced forecasting the potential northward spread of both species on the basis of a 1.5degC and a 4.5degC rise in global mean surface air-temperature. For an increase of 1.5degC maps demonstrate a maximum northward spread of F. japonica from a latitude of 63deg to 68degN and for I. glandulifera from 64deg up to 69degN. A temperature increase of 4.5degC indicates a considerable potential for expansion in the range of F. japonica in Norway and Sweden but a distribution which was restricted along the E coast of Sweden and S Finland. I. glandulifera could colonize the whole of Fennoscandinavia. Predictions are made assuming no migrational lag and no soil "incompatibility'. -from Author
