Exponential population increase in the endangered Ouvea Parakeet (Eunymphicus uvaeensis) after community-based protection from nest poaching
The Ouvea Parakeet (Eunymphicus uvaeensis), endemic to Ouvea Island (Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia, south-west Pacific), is a rainforest bird that is dependent on tree cavities for nesting. It is threatened by deforestation, but also by competition for nest sites with introduced bees, harvesting for pets, and potentially predation by introduced species. Despite these threats, we show that the Ouvea Parakeet population increased exponentially from an estimated 617 (274-996) birds in 1993 to 2,090 (1,280-3,413) birds in 2009 (95% confidence interval). We explain this population increase by community-based protection measures that eliminated nest poaching. We recommend that these measures are maintained, remnant forest is protected, and the introduction of rats is prevented. KeywordsNest poaching-Public awareness-Recovery plan-Threats
