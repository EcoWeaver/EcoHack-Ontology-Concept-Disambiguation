The recovery of the lower montane cloud forest in the Mucujun watershed, Merida, Venezuela
High deforestation rates in tropical countries continue to reduce forest cover and thereby habitat quantity and quality. However, in some places the forest is recovering and expanding thus offsetting the biodiversity and ecosystem service losses. In order to characterize the forest recovery, land use and land cover (LUC) changes were analyzed using aerial photographs, taken between 1952 and 2009, of a peri-urban watershed in the Andes region of Venezuela. The qualities of the changes were assessed using landscape indices and hemeroby indicators. In that period the forest cover increased about 18%, mainly on abandoned pastures on steep slopes. At the same time the urban are expanded about 4% on valley bottoms, while pastures and crop fields were reduced about 20%. The results also showed that forest patches were aggregating whereas pastures were fragmenting. A reduction in direct human impacts on forests growing on abandoned pastures resulted in a slight recovery of the original lower mountain cloud forest structure and plant composition. But non-native species were found in all LUC categories. During the study period we documented not only forest recovery, but also urban area growth, intensified land use and invasions by non-native species all of which could hinder the recovery of abandoned land to original cloud forest.
