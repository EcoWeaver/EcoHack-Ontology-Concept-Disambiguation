Impact assessment of an invasive flatworm, Convoluta convoluta, in the Southern Gulf of Maine
Convoluta convoluta (Abildgaard 1806) is a small (2-3 mm long) acoellous turbellarian flatworm from Europe that has invaded the Gulf of Maine within the last 5 years. Although it has been reported in densities of up to 19 individuals/cm2, its ecological impact remains unknown. In its native habitat, it consumes harpacticoid copepods and primary settling mussels <0.5-mm shell length. This study estimated the impact of C. convoluta on juvenile blue mussel populations (Mytilus edulis Linnaeus 1758) around the Isles of Shoals in the southern Gulf of Maine, USA as well as looking at their distribution in their new habitat. We surveyed worm densities at sites of differing wave exposure over three substrates (hard substrates, bladed algae, filamentous algae) to quantify patterns of worm abundance. We found worms on all substrate types with their highest abundances occurring in areas of maximal sunlight exposure and minimal physical disturbance. We showed a definite pattern of consumption of mussels in the lab and found C. convoluta to consume up to 35% of primary settling mussels in the field, but only under certain conditions. Per capita impact on juvenile mussels was found to vary greatly in correlation with mussel recruitment rate and water temperature, but not with the consumption of harpacticoids. Our results also suggested that per capita interaction strength was reduced by intraspecific density-dependent competition and water temperature. The overall impact of C. convoluta on mussel populations in the southern Gulf of Maine is therefore estimated to be minimal.
