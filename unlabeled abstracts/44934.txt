Microbial control of exotic spiraling whitefly,<i>Aleurodicus dispersus</i>with entomopathogenic fungi on cassava under open field conditions
The entomopathogenic fungi Isaria fumosorosea, Lecanicillium lecanii, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae were tested for their efficacy for the management of invasive spiraling whitefly, Aleurodicus dispersus (Hemiptera, Aleyrodidae) during two seasons (2011-2012 and 2012-2013) on cassava (Manihot esculenta). The fungi, I. fumosorosea and L. lecanii exhibited promising levels of control (>70% mortality of A. dispersus population). Mortality of A. dispersus increased with increase in time in both seasons. Application of I. fumosorosea was highly pathogenic to A. dispersus in both the seasons compared to the other entomopathogenic fungi. Mortality of A. dispersus in both seasons indicated difference in efficacy between 3 and 15 days after treatment. Season influenced the effects of the fungi on A. dispersus population. There is potential for entomopathogenic fungi to manage A. dispersus on cassava.
