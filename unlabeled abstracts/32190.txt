Find invasive seaweed: An outdoor game to engage children in science activities that detect marine biological invasion
Invasive species threaten worldwide biodiversity. Success in facing this problem may be possible through the engagement of younger audiences. Here, a game was designed to teach children how to recognize invasive seaweed and to encourage them to participate in marine citizen science. The game was first tested in a pilot study, and then carried out in Salinas High School (Asturias, Spain). Game-based training consisted of an explanation of invasive species, followed by the 'Find invasive seaweed' game and was evaluated with tests before and after the activity. After training, students spent 3 months looking for invasive species. Four invasive species were detected in the study area. The results showed a positive impact on knowledge gains and significant differences in marine environmental awareness and conservation actions.
