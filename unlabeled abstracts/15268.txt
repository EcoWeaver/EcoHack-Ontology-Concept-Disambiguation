Ecological aspects, explosive range extension and impact of a mass invader, Corophium curvispinum Sars, 1895 (Crustacea: Amphipoda), in the Lower Rhine (The Netherlands).
A few years after it invaded, the amphipod Corophium curvispinum Sars appeared to be the most numerous macroinvertebrate species in the River Rhine. From 1987 to 1991 the densities of this species on the stones of groins in the Lower Rhine at a depth of 0.5 m increased from 2 to 200000 specimens per m2. In the Lower Rhine and its branches the densities of C. curvispinum increased with increasing current velocities and with increasing water depths. So far, a maximum population density of 750000 specimens per m2 has been found in the Lower Rhine, which is many times the densities recorded elsewhere. Population parameters, densities and distribution of C. curvispinum were studied in the Lower Rhine and its branches, using artificial substrates and sampling stones from groins. The success of this immigrant is related to its competitive strategy, which shows several aspects of a r-strategy. In addition, the heavily eutrophicated Lower Rhine provides abundant food (phytoplankton, suspended organic matter) for this opportunistic filter-feeder. The increased salinity and water temperatures in the Lower Rhine resulting from industrial discharges have contributed to the current success of this southern species originating in brackish waters. The very high densities of C. curvispinum might have an enormous impact on the river ecosystem by changing food webs.
