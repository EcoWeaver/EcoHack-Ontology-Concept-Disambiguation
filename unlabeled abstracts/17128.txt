The impact ofBroussonetia papyrifera(L.) vent. on community characteristics in the forest and forest-savannah transition ecosystems of Ghana
Following its introduction in the late 1960s, Broussonetia papyrifera L. Vent. Moraceae (paper mulberry) has emerged as a major exotic invasive species in Ghana's forest ecosystems. This study was carried out to assess the effects of B. papyrifera invasion on community composition in forest and forest-savannah transition ecosystems. Comparative and removal experiments were conducted in paired B. papyrifera invaded versus uninvaded plots. In the comparative assessment, species composition was found to be similar in both invaded and uninvaded plots. However, relative per cent cover of resident species and guilds including Chromolaena odorata, indigenous broadleaves and indigenous grasses were significantly lower in invaded plots. Seven months after B. papyrifera was experimentally removed from invaded stands, cover by indigenous broadleaves increased by 35%, as against only 5% in control plots at the forest site. However, at the transition site, the increase in per cent cover of indigenous broadleaves (18%) was not significantly different from control (2.5%) plots. We conclude that B. papyrifera has the capacity to reduce the abundance of indigenous broadleaf species, although its removal is more likely to favour regeneration in a forest than a forest-savannah transition ecosystem.
