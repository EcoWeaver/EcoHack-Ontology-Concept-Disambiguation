Brood parasitism by mites (Uropodidae) in an invasive population of the pest-ant Pheidole megacephala
We report that in Okinawa Island (southern Japan) the pupae of the invasive ant Pheidole megacephala were parasitized by an undescribed Uropodidae mite species. Our observations suggest that by sucking the hemolymph of the ant pupae during its own development, mites induce some conspicuous morphological changes and the death of parasitized P. megacephala pupae. Of the 75 collected nests, 69 (92%) were infested by the mite species. The prevalence of parasitism varied strongly among the worker and sexual castes, with the soldier and male pupae being the most attacked, followed by the minor and queen pupae. Our data represent the first case of such high parasitism in an invasive ant population.
