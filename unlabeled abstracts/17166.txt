A street tree survey for Canadian communities: Protocol and early results
This paper describes early results from a survey that was developed to allow rapid, yet reasonably accurate, estimates of street tree composition in Canadian communities. To carry out surveys, participants walk (or drive) a number of 0.5-km routes, identifying all trees within 10 m of the road edge. The number of survey routes in each community was determined such that tree densities could be estimated within reasonable error bounds: +/- 5 trees/km for common species and +/- 1 tree/km for uncommon species. Information from this initiative has already supported invasive species risk assessments and urban forest management activities.
