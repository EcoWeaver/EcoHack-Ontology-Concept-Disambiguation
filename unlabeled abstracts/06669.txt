Complete chloroplast genome sequences of Praxelis (Eupatorium catarium Veldkamp), an important invasive species
Praxelis (Eupatorium catarium Veldkamp) is a new hazardous invasive plant species that has caused serious economic losses and environmental damage in the Northern hemisphere tropical and subtropical regions. Although previous studies focused on detecting the biological characteristics of this plant to prevent its expansion, little effort has been made to understand the impact of Praxelis on the ecosystem in an evolutionary process. The genetic information of Praxelis is required for further phylogenetic identification and evolutionary studies. Here, we report the complete Praxelis chloroplast (cp) genome sequence. The Praxelis chloroplast genome is 151,410bp in length including a small single-copy region (18,547bp) and a large single-copy region (85,311bp) separated by a pair of inverted repeats (IRs; 23,776bp). The genome contains 85 unique and 18 duplicated genes in the IR region. The gene content and organization are similar to other Asteraceae tribe cp genomes. We also analyzed the whole cp genome sequence, repeat structure, codon usage, contraction of the IR and gene structure/organization features between native and invasive Asteraceae plants, in order to understand the evolution of organelle genomes between native and invasive Asteraceae. Comparative analysis identified the 14 markers containing greater than 2% parsimony-informative characters, indicating that they are potential informative markers for barcoding and phylogenetic analysis. Moreover, a sister relationship between Praxelis and seven other species in Asteraceae was found based on phylogenetic analysis of 28 protein-coding sequences. Complete cp genome information is useful for plant phylogenetic and evolutionary studies within this invasive species and also within the Asteraceae family.
