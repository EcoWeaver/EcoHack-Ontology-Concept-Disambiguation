Seed production and population density decline approaching the range-edge of Cirsium species
Summary * Patterns in population density and abundance, community composition, seed production and morphological traits were assessed across the UK geographical range of Cirsium acaule , Cirsium heterophyllum and Cirsium arvense based on the expectation that environmental favourability declines from core to periphery of a species range. * These traits were measured in natural populations along a latitudinal transect in the UK and using botanical survey data. *A significant decline in population density and seed production occurs approach- ing the range edges of C. acaule and C. heterophyllum . There is no latitudinal trend in these traits in the widespread C. arvense and no latitudinal pattern to variation in morphological traits or community composition in any of these species. * Although seed production is reduced at the range edge of C. acaule and C. het- erophyllum, peripheral populations of these species may persist through clonal reproduction. Low seed production may interact with reduced availability of favour- able habitat to limit range expansion in these species.
