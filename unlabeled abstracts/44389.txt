Continental-scale plant invasions reshuffle the soil microbiome of blue carbon ecosystems
Theory and experiments support that plant invasions largely impact aboveground biodiversity and function. Yet, much less is known on the influence of plant invasions on the structure and function of the soil microbiome of coastal wetlands, one of the largest major reservoirs of biodiversity and carbon on Earth. We studied the continental-scale invasion of Spartina alterniflora (SA) across 2,451 km of Chinese coastlines as our model-system, and found that SA invasion can largely influence the soil microbiome (across six depths from 0-100 cm), compared with the most common microhabitat found before invasion (mudflats, Mud). In detail, SA invasion was positively associated with bacterial richness, but also resulted in important biotic homogenization of bacterial communities, suggesting plant invasion can lead to important continental scale trade-offs in the soil microbiome. We found that plant invasion changed the community composition of soil bacterial communities across the soil profile. Moreover, the bacterial communities associated with SA invasions where less responsive to climatic changes than those in native Mud microhabitats, suggesting that these new microbial communities might become more dominant under climate change. Plant invasion also resulted in important reductions in the complexity and stability of microbial networks, decoupling the associations between microbes and carbon pools. Taken together, our results indicated that plant invasions can largely influence the microbiome of coastal wetlands at the scale of China, representing the first continental-scale example on how plant invasions can reshuffle the soil microbiome, with consequences for the myriad of functions that they support.
