Conservation Status of Five Headwater Stream Specialists in South Dakota
Native stream fish zoogeography has changed substantially across North America during the last century because habitat degradation, stream fragmentation and introductions of nonnative species have led to numerous extinctions, extirpations, and altered distributions. Insufficient information regarding imperiled species often results in reactive, rather than proactive, management, and knowledge of species status and ecology is critical in identifying conservation priorities. We used fish collection records and a habitat assessment to update the status of five fishes of conservation interest in South Dakota (Northern Redbelly Dace Chrosomus eos, Finescale Dace Chrosomus neogaeus, Northern Pearl Dace Margariscus nachtriebi, Blacknose Shiner Notropis heterolepis, and Plains Topminnow Fundulus sciadicus). We compiled records from previous collections within the White, Little White, and Keya Paha River Basins in South Dakota as well as adjoining and neighboring drainage basins in Nebraska. We also sampled fish and habitat at 42 stream reaches within the White, Little White, and Keya Paha river basins during 2010-2012, focusing on tributary streams. We detected all target species except for Finescale Dace. All species preferred tributary streams over larger rivers (third order or greater). All target species except Blacknose Shiner exhibited patchy distribution and abundance patterns, normally occurring at low relative abundance where present but occasionally detected at moderate to high relative abundance. Each target species was limited to landscapes with perennial, springfed streams that are not present in neighboring drainages. This study updates the distribution of conservation listed species, identifies landscape level habitat filters, and offers guidance for conservation and research efforts.
