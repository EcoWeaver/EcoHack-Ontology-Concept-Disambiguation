Commentary: Aedes albopictus and Aedes japonicus--two invasive mosquito species with different temperature niches in Europe
In this interesting and original study, the authors present an ensemble Machine Learning (ML) model for the prediction of the habitats' suitability, which is affected by the complex interactions between living conditions and survival-spreading climate factors. The research focuses in two of the most dangerous invasive mosquito species in Europe with the requirements' identification in temperature and rainfall conditions. Though it is an interesting approach, the ensemble ML model is not presented and discussed in sufficient detail and thus its performance and value as a tool for modeling the distribution of invasive species cannot be adequately evaluated.
