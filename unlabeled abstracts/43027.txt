Climate warming, but not Spartina alterniflora invasion, enhances wetland soil HONO and NOx emissions
Climate warming and invasive plant growth (plant invasion) may aggravate air pollution by affecting soil nitrogen (N) cycling and the emissions of reactive N gases, such as nitrous acid (HONO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). However, little is known about the response of soil NOy (HONO + NOx) emissions and microbial functional genes to the interaction of climate warming and plant invasion. Here, we found that experimental warming (approximately 1.5 degC), but not Spartina alterniflora invasion, increased NOy emissions (0-140 ng N m-2 s-1) of treated wetland soils by 4-10 fold. Warming also decreased soil archaeal and fungal richness and diversity, shifted their community structure (e.g., decreased the archaeal classes Thermoplasmata and Iainarchaeia, and increased the archaeal genus Candidatus Nitrosoarchaeum, and the fungal classes Saccharomycetes and Tritirachiomycetes), and decreased the overall abundance of soil N cycling genes. Structural equation modeling revealed that warming-associated changes in edaphic factors and the microbial N cycling potential are responsible for the observed increase in soil NOy emissions. Collectively, the results showed that climate warming accelerates soil N cycling by stimulating large soil HONO and NOx emissions, and influences air quality by contributing to atmospheric reactive N and ozone cycling.
