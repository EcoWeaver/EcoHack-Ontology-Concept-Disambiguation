MOLTOOLS: a workshop on "Molecular tools for monitoring marine invasive species"
The 2011-2014 European Community project VECTORS ("Vectors of Change in Oceans and Seas-Marine Life, Impact on Economic Sectors") was an integrated, multidisciplinary European project which aimed to improve our understanding of how environmental anthropogenic drivers are impacting European marine ecosystems now and in the future. VECTORS investigated how these changes may affect marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, the range of goods and services provided by the oceans, the resulting socio-economic impacts and some possible future scenarios for mitigation and adaptation.The VECTORS Work Package WP2.1 (Mechanisms of Change: Outbreaks and Invasives) was committed to identifying mechanisms of species outbreaks and invasions and introduction vectors as both symptoms and drivers of change in European marine ecosystems. VECTORS particularly focused on native outbreak-forming species (OFS) and invasive alien species (IAS) (Box 1) to deliver new information on (1) IAS and OFS distrib ...
