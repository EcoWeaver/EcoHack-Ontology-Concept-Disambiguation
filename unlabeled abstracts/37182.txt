Response of Native Species 10 Years After Rat Eradication on Anacapa Island, California
Measuring the response of native species to conservation actions is necessary to 27 inform continued improvement of conservation practices. This is particularly true for 28 eradications of invasive vertebrates from islands where up-front costs are high, actions 29 may be controversial, and there is potential for negative impacts to native ("non-target") 30 species. We summarize available data on the response of native species on Anacapa 31 Island, California, ten years after the eradication of invasive black rats (Rattus rattus). 32 Native marine taxa hypothesized to respond positively to rat eradication increased in 33 abundance (Scripps's murrelet Synthliboramphus scrippsi; International Union for 34 Conservation of Nature Vulnerable, and intertidal invertebrates). Two seabird species 35 likely extirpated by rats, ashy storm-petrel (Oceanodroma homochroa; International 36 Union for Conservation of Nature Endangered) and Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus 37 aleuticus), are now confirmed to breed on the island. Long-term negative effects from 38 non-target impacts are limited. Rufous-crowned sparrows (Aimophila ruficeps obscura) 39 are still present, although likely in lower abundance. The endemic Anacapa deer mouse 40 Peromyscus maniculatus anacapae population increased with no loss in heterozygosity, 41 but with reduced genetic differentiation on East Anacapa and the loss of some alleles 42 across the islets. Intertidal invertebrate cover increased while algal cover decreased. 43 These findings clarify the pervasive effects of invasive rats on a wide variety of taxa, the 44 short- and long-term impacts of eradication, and the ability of some island fauna to 45 passively recover following a carefully planned rat eradication project.
