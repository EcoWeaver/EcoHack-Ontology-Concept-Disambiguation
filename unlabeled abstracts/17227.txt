Reduced pollen viability and achene development in Solidago xniederederi Khek from Poland
Pollen and achene characters of natural interspecific hybrid Solidago xniederederi Khek were analyzed and compared with putative parental species S. virgaurea L. and S. canadensis L. to estimate the level of disturbances in generative reproduction resulting from its hybrid nature. Pollen viability (stainability) of Solidago xniederederi from one newly discovered locality in NE Poland was evidently reduced to ~65% in both viability tests (acetocarmine and Alexander). The diameter of viable pollen (median 21.11 um) fell between S. canadensis (median 19.52 um) and S. virgaurea (median 23.48 um). Both parental species produced normally developed achenes with high frequency (~90%) whereas in the hybrid, the seed set was dramatically low (6%). The results clearly indicated that sexual reproduction of hybridogenous taxon S. xniederederi is disturbed, and its potential impact as an invasive species depends mainly on vegetative propagation.
