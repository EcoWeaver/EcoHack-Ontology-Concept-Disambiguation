Graying, greening and fragmentation in the rapidly expanding Indian city of Bangalore
Urbanization in Asia exhibits some distinctive patterns of change that are not observed in other Western countries. The south Indian city of Bangalore is India's second fastest growing city, and has witnessed the large scale destruction of vegetation in recent years for urban development. This research uses satellite imagery to study changes in vegetation cover in Bangalore between 2000 and 2007. We find anomalous patterns of vegetation change. The core is relatively well protected due to high land prices and the presence of large public institutions due to its historical pattern of development as a military station, but is undergoing fragmentation. Peripheral areas are undergoing rapid urbanization, vegetation clearing and fragmentation. Although greening is taking place in the landscape surrounding the city limits, this appears to be short term, largely consists of fast growing water hungry exotic species, and presages further rapid and large scale development as the city expands even further. The findings presented here have important implications for policy and planning at the local, city and regional level. These suggest that an especial emphasis needs to be made on understanding the role and importance of vegetation in rapidly expanding cities, to achieve a healthy urban environment.
