The invasive Symphyotrichum lanceolatum (Willd.) G.L. Nesom complex in wet habitats in Serbia
A growing body of evidence suggests that invasive plants can affect the stability of the ecosystem?s key species and influence flows and transformations of matter and energy in ecosystems. Since Symphyotrichum lanceolatum complex is one of the highly invasive plants in Serbia and many European countries, this study set out to determine floristic richness, struc?ture, and differentiations among the wet sites near linear corridors and to investigate the significance and representation of S. lanceolatum in degraded wet habitats. Accordingly, floristic diversity and the presence of other invasive plants were investigated in 22 wetland habitats. Overall, a total number of 179 plant taxa was found. Results showed four coenological groups. According to the invasive species coverage index (D%), S.lanceolatum dominated in all stands. Overall, based on the results, this study strengthens the idea that wet habitats belong to the group of habitats that are most susceptible to plant invasion.
