Genetic variation of the mtDNA cyt b locus in graylings (Thymalus sp.: Thymalidae, Pisces) introduced into the Baydrag Gol River of the Valley of Lakes basin (Mongolia)
Based on sequence variation of the mtDNA cyt b gene, an analysis of graylings introduced from the Arctic Ocean basin (Selenga River basin) into one of the rivers of Central Asian inland basin (Baydrag Goal River of the Valley of Lakes basin) was carried out. Morphological and molecular genetic identification was performed, and it was established that the introduced species corresponded to the Baikal grayling. The relationships among Central Asian grayling species are discussed.
