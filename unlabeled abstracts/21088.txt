The Norwegian reference lake ecosystem, Ovre Heimdalsvatn
The subalpine lake, Ovre Heimdalsvatn and its catchment, situated in the mountains of southern Norway, has been the subject of extensive ecosystem studies over the last 50years covering a wide range of disciplines. The lake is located at 1,088m a.s.l., has an area of 0.78km2, a maximum depth of 13m, and a catchment area of 23.6km2. It lies more or less on the limit of the birch forest, while the catchment extends up over 1,800m a.s.l. and into the high alpine zone. The valley is little influenced by human activity and there is no permanent habitation, although the area is used for grazing of domestic livestock during summer. Otherwise the lake and its catchment have always been important for fish and game. The catchment also received major radionuclide fallout from the Chernobyl accident in 1986. The studies include Quaternary history, the development of algorithms for remote sensing of snow conditions, long-term changes in lake ice cover and temperature, the zooplankton and benthic communities, as well as the uptake of Chernobyl radionuclides and mercury by the biota. The consequences of the introduction of the European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) on the benthos, zooplankton and the brown trout (Salmo trutta) have also been investigated. The lake and its catchment are widely used in university teaching and thesis work. On account of the substantial knowledge base, Ovre Heimdalsvatn is well suited to long-term monitoring.
