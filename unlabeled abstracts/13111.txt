Do hybrid-origin polyploid amphibians occupy transgressive or intermediate ecological niches compared to their diploid ancestors?
Speciation can either proceed as gradual divergence, mostly in allopatry or parapatry, or by duplication of chromosome sets: polyploidization. Hybrid-origin or allopolyploidization is an important mechanism of hybrid speciation with strong, although often incomplete, postzygotic reproductive barriers between the polyploid hybrid and its diploid parents. Allopolyploids often present novel phenotypes that exceed the ranges of their ancestral lineages, leading to the hypothesis that niche shifts could be supportive of hybrid speciation. Although polyploidy is phylogenetically widespread in animals, ecological niches of diploid ancestral and derived allopolyploids have been rarely comparatively examined. Here, we do so for five species of Palaearctic green toads (Bufo viridis subgroup), involving three ploidy levels.
