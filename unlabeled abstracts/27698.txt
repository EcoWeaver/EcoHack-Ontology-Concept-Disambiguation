The Mountain Invasion Research Network (MIREN). Linking Local and Global Scales for Addressing an Ecological Consequence of Global Change
Many modern environmental problems span vastly different spatial scales, from the management of local ecosystems to understanding globally interconnected processes, and addressing them through international policy. MIREN tackles one such "glocal" (global/local) environmental problem - plant invasions in mountains - through a transdisciplinary, multi-scale learning process at the science-policy interface. The approach led to a new framing of invasions in mountains, and promoted innovation by engaging scientists and practitioners.
