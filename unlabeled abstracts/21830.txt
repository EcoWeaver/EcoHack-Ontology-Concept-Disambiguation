The outcome of the invasion of Florida lakes by Daphnia lumholtzi
Summary1. We examined 7-12 years of monthly to quarterly historical data from 15 lakes in FL, U.S.A. to determine the extent and outcome of invasion by the alien cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi Sars.2. The alien species was found in 10 of the 15 lakes, including Florida's three largest lakes: Okeechobee, George and Apopka. All the surveyed lakes had resident populations of the smaller native species Daphnia ambigua Scourfield.3. In most of the lakes, D. ambigua occurred seven to ninefold more often in plankton samples than D. lumholtzi, and at 10- to 100-fold higher maximal densities. One exception was a small lake in central Florida (Lake Jesup), where D. lumholtzi attained high densities on several occasions in the 10 years of sampling.4. In Lake Okeechobee, where data were of sufficient quality and quantity to perform statistical analyses, the results of canonical correlation analysis indicated that high densities of D. lumholtzi were correlated with lower concentrations of suspended solids, high algal biomass and higher temperature, whereas the opposite conditions were correlated with high densities of D. ambigua.5. Based on the majority of data, D. lumholtzi has successfully invaded many lakes in Florida, yet it has not become a substantive component of the zooplankton. Additional research is needed to determine whether resources, fish predation or some other factor is responsible for this outcome of invasion.
