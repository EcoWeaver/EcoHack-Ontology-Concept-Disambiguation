The role of international organisations in controlling invasive species and preserving biodiversity
Invasive alien species spread through the environment and threaten native biodiversity, assisted by the absence of natural enemies. Alien species may also carry pathogens, which can be transmitted to native species. About half of the known endangered species are under threat from invasive alien species. The Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2008 invited relevant international organisations to work together to fill the gap in the international regulatory framework on invasive alien species. The Convention also reaffirmed the need for capacity and expertise to deal with invasive alien species in many countries, especially in developing countries. In this paper, the authors review the findings of this project.
