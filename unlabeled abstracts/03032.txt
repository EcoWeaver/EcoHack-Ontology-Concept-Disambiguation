Emergence of Aedes koreicus (Diptera: Culicidae) in an urban area, Hungary, 2016.
In June 2016, three adult females of Aedes koreicus mosquitoes were trapped in the urban area of Pecs, Southwest Hungary. The introduction of this invasive mosquito species in this region, along with the recent detection in Germany, may indicate the capability of the species to spread across Europe. Along with Aedes albopictus and Aedes japonicus mosquitoes, this is the third invasive mosquito species occurred in Hungary.
