Could ecological release buffer suppression efforts for non-native lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park?
Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park, USA, has the longest ongoing suppression program for non-native lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in the western USA. Harvest data from the suppression program, along with data from an assessment program initiated in 2011, was used to estimate lake trout abundance and mortality rates. Abundance and biomass estimates were used to estimate stock-recruitment dynamics, which were inputs to a simulation model forecasting responses to continued suppression. Abundance increased during 1998-2012 when total annual mortality exceeded 0.59 and declined thereafter. The fishing mortality rate required to reduce abundance was 67% greater than predicted by models that used pre-recruit survival estimates from the lake trout's native range. Pre-recruit survival in Yellowstone Lake was estimated at 4-6 times greater than native range survival rates. Simulated abundance continued to decline if recent suppression efforts were maintained. High pre-recruit survival in Yellowstone Lake likely illustrates ecological release for an invasive species in an ecosystem containing few predators or competitors and demonstrates the potential pitfalls of assuming equal demographic rates for native and non-native populations.
