Climate change may reduce the spread of non-native species
Invasive species are considered a major threat to ecosystem functioning and native biodiversity. Their negative impacts on ecosystems and the provisioning of ecosystem services have been widely documented. South Africa faces one of the most significant challenges from invasive species globally, and the South African government spent an estimated US $100 million to mitigate impacts of non-native species between 1995 and 2000 alone. Here, we modeled the current climatic niche of 162 non-native trees and shrubs within South Africa and explored potential shifts in their distribution with projected climate change. Our results indicate that over half of these species will experience a decrease in their suitable climate over the next decades, although not uniformly so and ranges are predicted to expand into some regions. We also compared recent vs. historical introductions and showed similar patterns, indicating that possible violation of equilibrium assumptions in our distribution models likely does not strongly influence our findings. We suggest that climate change may therefore provide a window of opportunity for more effective invasive species control within South Africa, but that large range shifts are likely for many non-natives in the future, and new invasive threats might emerge.
