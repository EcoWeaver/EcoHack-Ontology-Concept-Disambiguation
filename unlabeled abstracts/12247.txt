State investment in science and entrepreneurship for environmental change in Queensland, 1912-16: The story of Cactus Estates Ltd
AbstractGovernments across the globe use public-private partnerships to foster entrepreneurship while limiting their risk. ThePrickly Pear Destruction Act 1912enabled the Queensland government to enter contracts with private entities for land heavily covered with prickly pear (OpuntiaandNopaleaspecies). The story of Cactus Estates Ltd, the first negotiation under the Act, provides an opportunity to analyse this response to local ecologies changed by nineteenth-century plant transfers. Most scholarship on the invasion of prickly pear focuses on the science of entomology due to the spectacular success of the introduction ofCactoblastis cactorumin 1926. This article examines an earlier period in the history of applied science in Queensland. The Queensland government, along with scientific and business communities, pursued poisons for controlling the density of plant growth as the preferred mechanism for eliminating plants. Cactus Estates Ltd experimented with arsenic-based poisons for this purpose. An examination of Cactus Estates Ltd provides evidence of the state's willingness to produce a multifaceted approach to dealing with invasive species in Australia in the early twentieth century.
