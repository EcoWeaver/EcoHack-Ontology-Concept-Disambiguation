Native parasitoid complex of the invasive fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) from Northern India
Biological control of invasive fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is important in Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Surveys were conducted to determine the native parasitoid complex and to assess parasitism rates of FAW in its newly invaded areas. Overall, 80.46% larval mortality by the natural enemy complex was observed. Chelonus nr. blackburni (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was the predominant parasitoid in the study area causing 49.24% larval mortality followed by Chelonus formosanus. This study reports the native parasitoid complex of FAW from North Indian conditions as well as the first report of Temelucha sp. (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) parasitizing FAW from Indian geographical boundaries.
