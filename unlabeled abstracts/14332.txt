Effects of timing of prescribed fire on the demography of an invasive plant, spotted knapweed Centaurea maculosa
We constructed stage-based (Lefkovitch 1965) transition matrices for populations in each treatment at each site for each year (2001-02 and 2002-03). Despite differences in site productivity and initial abundance of C. maculosa, site was never a significant predictive factor of growth rates (for 2001-02 transitions, F3,32 = 1*6, P= 0*22; for 2002-03 transitions, F2,24 = 0*42, P= 0*66), so we averaged across sites for all analyses presented here. We also calculated summary matrices for each treatment across both years by weighting each transition by its frequency in the population. These summary matrices better represent the dynamics over the 2 years of observations. We used five stages in the model: seed bank (1), first-year juveniles (2), non-reproductive adults (3), small reproductive adults (4), and large reproductive adults (5) (Fig. 1). Survival, growth and regression (transition to a smaller stage class) were calculated by following the fates of tagged individuals. Reproduction was represented as the number of first-year juveniles appearing every year (minus the small number of juveniles appearing in the seed exclosure cages in 2002, which we used to measure transitions from the seed bank). Transitions were calculated from seed production fractions (e.g. a plant that produced 10% of the total seeds in a plot was assumed to account for 10% of the total first-year juveniles per plot). Contributions to the seed bank were calculated based on total seed production minus the seedlings that germinated. This is probably an overestimation of contributions to the seed bank, as we did not account for seed predation or other sources of seed death. Contributions from the seed bank were calculated from germination in our seed-exclosure cages. We assumed a 50% survival rate of seeds in the seed bank from year to year because we were unable to assess directly effects of fire on survival of seeds in the seed bank.
