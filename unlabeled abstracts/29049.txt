Developing innovative methods to face aquatic invasions in Europe: the Aquainvad-ED project
Aquatic Invasive Alien Species (AIAS) are increasing due to the synergistic effects of climate change and habitat destruction. AIAS can heavily impact biodiversity and human health, causing a loss of ecosystem services; therefore, their control and management have now become a priority, particularly in the light of the new EU regulation 1143/2014 on invasive alien species. The main research goal of the Innovative Training Network Marie Sklodowska-Curie Aquainvad-ED is to exploit the application of innovative tools and the power of citizen science for early detection, control and management of AIAS. Eight early stage researchers are involved in Aquainvad-ED, engaged in four main research themes: (1) development and application of novel methods for early detection of AIAS; (2) identification of vectors of introduction and pathways of dispersal; (3) impacts of freshwater and marine invaders; and (4) risk assessment and control of AIAS. In order to develop multidisciplinary approaches to address these issues, the fellows are working within an international consortium (UK, Spain, Italy) composed of scientists and conservation practitioners from three universities (Swansea University, Universidad de Oviedo, Universita degli Studi di Firenze), one technological institute (AZTI), two governmental agencies (Natural Resources Wales and Cardiff Harbour Authority), one NGO (Wye & Usk Foundation) and five SMEs working in fundamental and applied aspects of AIAS (Neoalgae, Natural Applications, NEMO, Ecohydros, and Itinera C.E.R.T.A).
