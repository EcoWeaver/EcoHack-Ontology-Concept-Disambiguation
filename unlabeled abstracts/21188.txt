Introgression between native and prehistorically naturalized (archaeophytic) wild pear (Pyrus spp.) populations in Northern Tohoku, Northeast Japan
Hybridization between native and cultivated species is a concern in conservation biology. However, detecting such hybridization and distinguishing true natives from prehistorically naturalized species based on phenotypic characteristics is difficult. Here, we report on introgression between native and prehistorically introduced pear (Pyrus) species in Northern Tohoku (northern end of Honshu Island), Japan. We analyzed 20microsatellites in 226 wild, seemingly wild, or cultivated materials. Phenetic analysis showed that wild Japanese populations of P. ussuriensis var. ussuriensis in Northern Tohoku, previously considered true natives based on morphology and phytogeography, differed from those in continental Asia, confirming their nativeness. However, Bayesian inference of population structures showed that Japanese P. ussuriensis was genetically admixed with two genetic clusters: true native P. ussuriensis var. ussuriensis and prehistorically introduced P. pyrifolia. Even in the Kitakami Mountains, where true native populations of var. ussuriensis are believed to persist, most wild trees were at least somewhat admixed. Prehistorically introduced then naturalized plants are treated as natives in Japan's conservation management, and some are considered endangered. However, introgression of prehistorically naturalized P. pyrifolia into threatened native P. ussuriensis var. ussuriensis has occurred. This paper examines the implications for conservation management.
