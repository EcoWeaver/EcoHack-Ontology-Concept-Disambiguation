Evidence of naturalisation of the invasive jaguar cichlid Parachromis managuensis (Gunther, 1867), in Queensland, Australia
The introduction and spread of non-native species poses a significant threat to the health of freshwater ecosystems, and has recently been identified as the single biggest danger to threatened species survival in Australia. Notwithstanding, the importation, trade and keeping of exotic and potentially invasive freshwater fishes in Australia is significant, resulting in greater propagule pressure and higher risk for deliberate or incidental release into native waterways. The jaguar cichlid (Parachromis managuensis) is an invasive cichlid that has established non-native populations in many countries throughout the world. In December 2014, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in Queensland was notified of an incursion of jaguar cichlids in a stormwater retention dam in the Pioneer River Catchment, Mackay, Queensland. Rotenone was applied to the dam in January 2015, and around 200 jaguar cichlid specimens at various life history stages were destroyed. Follow up surveys into mid-2015 did not detect the presence of any jaguar cichlid in the dam or in nearby creeks. In September 2017, the Department was notified of a wild capture of a mature jaguar cichlid in Fursden Creek, 1.5 km from the original incursion site. Follow up surveys in 2018/19 have also detected jaguar cichlid juveniles in surrounding tributaries, indicating successful establishment and naturalisation of the species in Australia for the first time.
