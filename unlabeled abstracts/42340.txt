A data driven method for prioritizing invasive species to aid policy and management
Natural resource managers overseeing large regions are often challenged by an overwhelmingly long list of invasive species to prioritize for management and surveys. Often, managers determine priorities through subjective experience and not regional data, contributing to a lack of objectivity, consistency, and transparency. Using the invasion curve as a guiding principle, we developed a data-driven process to guide expert input in creating regionally specific invasive species lists based on management priorities. The invasive species tiers framework uses a standardized set of definitions, data from locational databases and invasiveness assessments, and expert review to categorize highly invasive species present in and surrounding the target regions. The analysis process was evaluated and improved by feedback from the structured network of invasive species managers in New York State. Results of the invasive species tiers process for eight management regions and at the state-scale were made publicly available, and demonstrated variation in invasive species diversity across the management landscape. The approach developed here can be replicated in and scaled to other regions of the U.S. or other countries with comparable data, and it can provide a common management language to better coordinate invasive species management efforts.
