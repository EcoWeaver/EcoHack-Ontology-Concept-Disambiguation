Using host plant relationships to help determine origins of the invasive Erythrina gall wasp, Quadrastichus erythrinae Kim (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae)
The Erythrina gall wasp has recently invaded a wide swath of Asian and Pacific countries, causing severe damage to several species of Erythrina trees. It poses an imminent threat to native Erythrina species in Latin America, Asia, Australia and the Pacific. While an African origin of the pest is presumed, it's exact home on the continent remains unknown. We examined host plant relationships of the wasp using 71 of the world's species of Erythrina that are planted in the botanical gardens of Hawaii. Observational and experimental data indicate that species endemic to Africa are more resistant to the wasp than those from other continents. Complete absence of galling on all Erythrina native to Benin, Burundi, Congo, Gambia, Lesoto, Rwanda, and Somalia make those countries highly unlikely to be the origin of the wasp. Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe were also shown to be unlikely sources. We present susceptibility indices of all 71 Erythrina species, including a number of economically useful trees, and we provide a warning for several species of conservation concern.
