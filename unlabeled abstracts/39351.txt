Influence of Floristic Structure, Vegetation Density and Nutrient Content on the Occurrence and Abundance of Invasive Species in Aquatic Communities
The paper analyses the influence of floristic structure, vegetation density and nutrient content on the occurrence and abundance of invasive species in aquatic vegetation communities in canal network in Serbia. The results of Shannon-Weaver index of diversity, index of evenness, Steinhaus index of floristic similarity, correlations between the identified plant species with invasive species and PCA analysis showed that nutrient content has a decisive role in the occurrence of invasive species in aquatic vegetation communities. Despite high diversity, uniformity and density of the stands, they were not efficient in preventing the occurrence of invasive species when the values of nutrient content in water (total phosphorus, NH+4 and NO-3) were increased. In further research, it would be interesting to determine the impact of other factors which affect the integrity of these communities and thus increase their invasibility.
