Parasitic infections of two invasive fish species, the Caucasian dwarf goby and the Amur sleeper, in Hungary
In recent years and decades, two new fish species, the Caucasian dwarf goby (Knipowitschia caucasica) and the Amur sleeper (Perccottus glenii) have become members of the Hungarian fish fauna. In a 14-month study on the parasite fauna of these species, the authors detected 11 parasite species in the Caucasian dwarf goby and 17 species in the Amur sleeper. All parasites found in dwarf goby belong to species commonly occurring also in native Hungarian fishes, but three species (Goussia obstinata, Gyrodactylus perccotti and Nippotaenia mogurndae) collected from the Amur sleeper are introduced species new for the Hungarian fauna.
