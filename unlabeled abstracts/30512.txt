Sex Ratio Variation of Bischofia javanica Bl. (Euphorbiaceae) between Native Habitat, Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands), and Invaded Habitat, Ogasawara (Bonin Islands)
The sex ratios of Bischofia javanica, a dioecious tree species, were studied in populations native to the island of Okinawa and in populations that invaded the island of Ogasawara. The sex ratios of all (six) populations in Okinawa were not significantly different from 1 : 1, but all (five) populations in Ogasawara were significantly biased (P < 0.05). Sex ratio was significantly male biased in all size classes (size classes determined by diameter at breast height; DBH) in Ogasawara, and the degree of male bias was significantly larger in smaller size classes than in larger size classes. This indicates that the earlier reproduction of males and their higher flowering frequency cause male bias in the invaded habitat. However, these factors could not explain the difference of population sex ratios between the two islands. The conditions on the island of Ogasawara had a significant effect on DBH. The influences of sex on DBH depended heavily on this island. This result indicates that differences in environmental conditions, such as climate and soils, and biological conditions, such as competitors and herbivores, affect the growth rate of B. javanica. These factors could be related to the significant difference of sex ratios between the two islands.
