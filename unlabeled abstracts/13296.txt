Ecological niche modelling confirms potential north-east range expansion of the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) in the USA
The distribution of the nine banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), the only species in the family Dasypodidae found in the USA, has expanded greatly since the species was first recorded in southern Texas in 1849. Currently, the range of D. novemcinctus includes 15 states in the USA. Previous studies on the geographical expansion of this species, based on physiological experiments and distribution surveys, revealed a possible western moisture limit, a northern temperature limit, and potential north-eastward range expansion in the USA. We applied an ecological niche modelling approach and produced a potential distribution map of D. novemcinctus with comparable western (102 degW) and northern (40 degN) limits, and confirmed the possibility of further north-east range expansion to climatically suitable areas in the USA.
