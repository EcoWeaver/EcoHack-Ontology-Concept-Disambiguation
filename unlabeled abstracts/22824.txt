Allelopathic potential of two invasive alien Ludwigia spp
The allelopathic potential of two invasive alien Ludwigia [Onagraceae: L. peploides (Kunth) Raven and L. grandiflora (Michaux) Greuter and Burdet], that have developed quasi-monotypic stands in many aquatic ecosystems in France, was investigated. Since allelopathy involves the release of compounds into the environment, the water of monospecific experimental cultures was directly tested against two target species: Lactuca sativa L., the standard cultivar for bioassays, and Nasturtium officinale R. Brown, a resistant and widespread native hydrophyte. The treatment was carried out at the three main phases of development of both Ludwigia in February, May and August. For each experiment, the germination, mortality and culture yield percentages, the seedling growth (radicle and hypocotyl elongation) and the health of 15-day-old-seedlings were measured. The water of each Ludwigia tank induced: (1) a decrease in germination for watercress in August (control: 68.6%, L. peploides: 48.6%, L. grandiflora: 61.1%); (2) an increase in mortality in May only for watercress (control: 3.4%, L. peploides: 13.5%, L. grandiflora: 12%) and in August for both target species (up to 22.3% vs. 3% for lettuce and 27% vs. 12.5% for watercress); (3) a disturbance of seedling elongation for lettuce in all seasons; and (4) a seedling chlorosis of both target species, particularly in May and August. This study showed that L. peploides and L. grandiflora possess an allelopathic activity that influences the water quality throughout the year. Combined with the various competitive attributes, allelopathy may contribute to the great success of these two invasive Ludwigia in Europe. In threatened wetland communities of the Mediterranean area, in particular, allelopathy might have an important impact by diminishing the seedling survival of the most vulnerable species.
