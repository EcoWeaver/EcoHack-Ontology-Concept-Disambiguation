Exotic oniscideans (Crustacea: Isopoda) in coastal salt marshes: first record of the families Halophilosciidae and Platyarthridae in Continental Chile
We report two new exotic introduced isopods in Chile: Halophiloscia couchii of the family Halophilosciidae and Niambia capensis of the family Platyarthridae. This report provides first evidence of the presence of these species in the Southeastern Pacific. These species were found in several salt marshes and beaches spanning nearly 2000 km of the Chilean coast. With the data reported here, the percentage of exotic oniscidean isopods in Chile is 28%.
