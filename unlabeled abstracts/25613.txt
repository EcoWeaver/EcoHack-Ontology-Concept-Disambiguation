Grazing of the invasive alga Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides by the common periwinkle Littorina littorea: Effects of thallus size, age and condition
We examined the potential of herbivory by the common periwinkle Littorina littorea to limit recruitment and vegetative re-growth of the invasive green alga Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides in a series of manipulative field experiments in tidepools on a wave-exposed rocky shore in Nova Scotia, Canada. Snails were excluded or included from circular plots (14 to 20 cm diameter) with cages to compare growth and survival of C. fragile against procedural (partial cages) or natural (uncaged) control plots. Our results show that L. littorea may restrict growth and survival of C. fragile by grazing new recruits (
