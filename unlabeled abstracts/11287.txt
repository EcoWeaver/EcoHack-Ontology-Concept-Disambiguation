The influence of invasive fire ants on survival, space use, and patterns of natural selection in juvenile lizards
Invasive species have altered natural com- munities and exposed native species to new selective pressures. These pressures are particularly acute when invasive species are predators of natives. The invasive red imported fire ant has expanded its range signifi- cantly in the southeast United States and has become an important predator of native species that share similar habitat preferences, like the prairie lizard, Sceloporus consobrinus. Recent studies indicate that lizards that have coexisted for a long period of time with fire ants have responded both plastically and adaptively to this invasion. However, despite consid- erable work, few ''controlled'' experiments have been conducted to explore the influence of fire ants on vertebrates in natural populations. In this study we released hatchling lizards on two experimental islands that differed in fire ant density to investigate the influence of fire ants on lizard survival, habitat/space use, and patterns of phenotypic selection. We demon- strate that fire ant presence significantly explains patterns of lizard survival among populations and over small spatial scales within populations. As a conse- quence of survival patterns or avoidance behavior, lizard habitat use was significantly altered in the presence of fire ants in high density. Finally, we found strong signatures of natural selection on lizard body size and body condition, but the patterns of selection did not appear to be influenced by variation in fire ant density. This study highlights the direct influence of predatory fire ants on hatchling lizard mortality and habitat use. These effects can have important demo- graphic and population-level consequences.
