Social diversity and ecological complexity: how an invasive tree could affect diverse agents in the land of the tiger
A bioeconomic model is used to study the effect of Prosopis juliflora, an exotic tree, on diverse agents in Ranthambhore National Park. Tigers prey on wild herbivores, cattle, and goats that compete with each other to feed on green biomass, i.e. leaves and grass. There are four agents: goat owner, cattle owner, wood gatherer, and park manager. It is shown that there is an inherent trade-off between the number of tigers and village livestock that are grazing. Prosopis juliflora makes management of this trade-off more difficult. The four agents have different interests in the park, and a different ranking of the four scenarios that are simulated.
