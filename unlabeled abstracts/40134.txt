Composition of native and alien invasive species in soil seed banks of five different physiognomies in Akure Forest Reserve, Ondo State, Nigeria
The study investigated the composition of native and alien invasive species in soil seed banks of five different vegetation physiognomies in Akure Forest Reserve Ondo State, Nigeria. This was done with a view to determining and providing an insight into the population dynamics of alien, invasive species for subsequent prediction of potential plant population of the extant population. Five distinct sites (Natural forest, Teak plantation, Taungya system, Taungya + Teak + Gmelina and Teak + Gmelina + Pinus Plantation) designated as A, B, C, D and E were selected in the Forest Reserve. Two plots 25 m x 25 m each were selected for sampling in each of the five distinct physiognomies. Five replicates soil samples were randomly collected at 0-15 cm soil depth in dry and rainy seasons in each site and they were subjected to seedlings emergence for six months to determine the density and species composition (natives or aliens and percentage contribution) of the seed bank. The results of the seedling emergence revealed that the seed bank was dominated by herbaceous stems and also the proportion of aliens to natives was low. Analysis of variance revealed that there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in the density of both the aliens and native species in sites A, B and C indicating similarities in the seed bank density of the aliens and natives in the three sites while in sites D and E, there was a significant difference (P<0.05) indicating dissimilarity in the seed bank density of the aliens and natives in the two sites.Keywords: Plant Ecology, Forest, Seedling Emergence, Seed Bank, Alien Species, Conservation.
