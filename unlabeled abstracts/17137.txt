Identification and potential origin of invasive clawed frogsXenopus(Anura: Pipidae) in Sicily based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
African clawed frogs of the widespread polytypic species Xenopus laevis Daudin, 1802 (ranging large parts of sub-Saharan Africa) have been spreading since the 1940s, and have established reproductive populations in Europe, Asia and the Americas, where they can have negative impact as competitors of native amphibians and as disease vectors for chytridomycosis or ranaviruses. Here we use two mitochondrial (cytochrome b, 16S rDNA) and one nuclear (RAG 1: Recombination Associated Gene 1) DNA markers to infer the potential origin of invasive clawed frogs from Sicily that represent the largest invasive population in Europe. Identical mtDNA haplotypes match with those of Xenopus laevis, and Sicilian clawed frogs very probably belong to a lineage from the Cape Region of South Africa, most likely originating from a laboratory stock.Nuclear data support this conclusion. Identical mtDNA sequences (cyt b, 16S) of frogs sampled across their range in Sicily suggest the occurrence of a single source population and a potential bottleneck at their release, but faster evolving multilocus nuclear data (microsatellites, SNPs) on the population genetics would be important in the future to better support this hypothesis.
