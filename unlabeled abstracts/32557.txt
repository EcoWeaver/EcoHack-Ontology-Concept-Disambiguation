First Report of Powdery Mildew Caused by Golovinomyces asterum var. solidaginis on Invasive Weed Solidago gigantea in Korea
Solidago gigantea Aiton (syn. S. serotina Aiton), known as giant goldenrod, is native to North America and has been invasive in Europe and Asia. In Korea, this plant was accidentally introduced around the 1960s and has become widely naturalized by replacing indigenous plants and disrupting the native ecosystem (3). In October 2012, hundreds of giant goldenrod plants growing wild in riverine areas and roadsides were found affected by a powdery mildew in Busan, Korea. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Korea University Herbarium (KUS). Symptoms first appeared as circular to irregular white patches, which subsequently showed abundant hyphal growth on both sides of the leaves. Appressoria on the mycelium were nipple-shaped to moderately lobed. Conidiophores measured 120 to 240 x 10 to 12.5 mm, were arising laterally from hyphal mother cells, and produced 2 to 6 immature conidia in chains with a sinuate outline, followed by 2 to 3 cells. Foot-cells in conidiophores were 42 to 70 mm long and characterized ...
