An invasive crab alters interaction webs in a marine community
Over the last decade, the non-native, filter-feeding crab Petrolisthes armatus invaded oyster reefs of the South Atlantic Bight at densities of thousands m-2. Mesocosm and field experiments demonstrated that P. armatus at ~10-75% of mean summer densities: (1) suppressed growth of small oysters, biomass of benthic microalgae, and recruitment of native mud crabs, (2) enhanced oyster, mussel, and total bivalve recruitment, macroalgal cover, and survivorship of predatory oyster drills, but (3) did not affect native taxonomic richness. Laboratory feeding assays, field tethering experiments, and population changes in field and mesocosm experiments suggest that P. armatus is a preferred prey for native mud crabs and other consumers, thus relieving predation on native species and enhancing recruitment or survival of bivalves and oyster drills. In contrast, the invasive crab can consume crustacean larvae and via this feeding may suppress recruitment of native mud crabs. Our findings should be conservative given the low densities of P. armatus seeded into experimental plots and our inability to run longer-term experiments due to controls rapidly being colonized by non-native crabs recruiting from the plankton. Invasive crabs commonly impact native communities via predation, but community impacts of this invasive crab may be as much due to its role as a preferred prey of native consumers as to its predation on native prey. Given that oysters are foundation species for shallow reefs in the South Atlantic Bight, the long-term effects of this invasion could be considerable.
