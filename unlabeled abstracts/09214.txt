Effects of Introduced Bullfrogs and Smallmouth Bass on Microhabitat Use, Growth, and Survival of Native Red-Legged Frogs (Rana aurora)
We examined the direct and indirect effects of two introduced species, the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui), on th microhabitat use, growth, development, and survival of larval and metamorphic red-legged frogs (Rana aurora). In field enclosure experiments, tadpoles of R. aurora altered their microhabitat use in the presence of both species. The shift in microhabitat use by R. aurora corresponded to increased activity in adult R. catesbeiana. Time to metamorphosis increased and mass at metamorphosis decreased when R. aurora tadpoles were exposed to either larval or adult R. catesbeiana. In contrast, smallmouth bass alone had little effect on the growth and development of R. aurora. In all experiments, survivorship of R. aurora was significantly affected only when R. aurora were exposed to the combined effects of bullfrog larvae and adults or bullfrog larvae and smallmouth bass. Thus, the interaction between stages (larval-adult) or species (bullfrog-smallmouth bass) produced indirect effects that were greater than when each factor was considered separately.
