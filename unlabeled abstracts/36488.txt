Distribution of the Invasive Species Ailanthus altissima (P. Mill.) Swingle Along the Danube River Banks on the Territory of Novi Sad
Summary As an invasive species, Ailanthus altissima (P.Mill) Swingle can pose a serious threat to biodiversity and ecosystems. The purpose of this research is to determine the distribution of A. altissima along the Danube river bank in the urban and ruderal areas of Novi Sad during the period 2017-2018. The level of weediness was determined using the European Weed Research Society (EWRS) method based on the investigated species count per 1 m2 (in 10 repetitions). A total of 7 localities with a widespread population of the species were identified and examined. The largest number of A. altissima individuals featured tree heights of up to 1 m, followed by trees of up to 10 m in height, whereas older trees exceeding 10 m in height accounted for the smallest number of individuals. The species examined was found to be predominant on chernozem and alluvial soils.
