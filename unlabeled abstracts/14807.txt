Molecular characterization of two non-native species of Dactylogyrus (Monogenea: Dactylogyridae) recovered from introduced hosts in India
Freshwater fish from the Guwahati in River Brahmaputra, Assam, India were screened for infection with Monogenea. The recovered parasites were diagnosed by PCR and sequencing the 18S and 28S rDNA subunit regions. Comparison of the obtained nucleotide sequences with sequences in GenBank identified the specimens as Dactylogyrus extensus Mueller and Van Cleave, 1932 and D. lamellatus Achmerow, 1952, recovered from Cyprinus carpio and Ctenopharyngodon idella (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae) respectively. The obtained sequences differed by only 2-3 nucleotides from the sequences deposited in GenBank. The presence of D. extensus and D. lamellatus in India can result from the introductions of their respective host carrying their parasites with them.
