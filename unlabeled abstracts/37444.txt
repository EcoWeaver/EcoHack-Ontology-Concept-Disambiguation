The edible tissues of the major European population of the invasive Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) in the Elbe River, Germany, as a valuable and safe complement in essential elements to the human diet
The Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) is an invasive species in Europe. This study aimed to determine the levels of Al, As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn in the muscles and hepatopancreas of female and male and in the gonads of females caught in the Elbe River (Germany), relative to water and sediment levels, using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Elemental levels were compared with the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI). The results showed that females had significantly higher muscle levels of Cr and Zn than the males, and males had significantly higher hepatopancreas levels of Cd, Se, and Co. Generally, the hepatopancreas had significantly higher levels of most elements than the gonads and muscles. Levels of Cu, Fe, and Zn exceeded the Recommended Dietary Allowances. The levels of all the elements were below the Tolerable Upper Intake Level, and Tolerable Daily Intakes for Pb, Cd, Cr, Co, and As were not exceeded. In conclusion, the edible parts of the crabs can be an excellent supplement to the human diet, and the intake of 100 g portions a day will not exceed DRI for the studied elements.
