Long term dynamics of Rosa multiflora in a successional system
Long term studies of invasion dynamics are critical in developing a more complete understanding of the factors that influence species spread. To address this issue, the dynamics of the non-native invasive plant, Rosa multiflora, were examined using a 40-year record of successional change. The roles of biotic and abiotic factors in regulating R.multiflora invasion were also assessed. The invasion showed an initial 9-year time lag, followed by a 20-year period of population expansion and an ultimate decline as succession progressed. During all phases of R.multiflora's invasion, there was continuous turnover within plots. Rainfall during the previous season was found to increase R.multiflora colonization during population expansion while tree species inhibited the invader's growth. During expansion and decline of R.multiflora, common associated species were often positively or negatively correlated with changes in R.multiflora cover. Though early population dynamics were regulated by propagule pressure, the major influence on R.multiflora late in succession was canopy closure. Although the invasion of this species was largely self-limiting in this system, the species is likely to persist within late successional systems and may require management intervention.
