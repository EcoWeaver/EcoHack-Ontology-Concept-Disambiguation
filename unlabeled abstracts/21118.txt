Flight Performance of Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) on a Flight Mill and in Free Flight
Computer-monitored flight mills were used to record the flight performance of the emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire. Flight performance of fed and unfed, and mated and unmated beetles of both sexes were recorded and compared. Mated females flew further per day and longer than unmated females or males. Mated females that were allowed to feed between flight periods flew an average of 1.3 km/day for four days; 10% flew more than 7 km/day. Measurements of free-flight speed using a mirror and a high-speed camera were used to calibrate the flight mill results, permitting absolute estimates of flight performance to be made. Free-flight speeds were approximately three times the speeds recorded by the flight mills. The median corrected distance flown by mated females was >3 km with 20% flying >10 km and 1% flying >20 km. The flight performance of mated females suggests a considerable capacity for range expansion by this invasive species. The implications for quarantine and control are discussed.
