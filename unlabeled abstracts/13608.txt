Greenhouses: hotspots in the invasive network for alien species
Though special nodes play an important role in spreading invasive species, most attempts have focused on modeling the invasive pathway. Few invasion hotspots, such as botanic gardens and greenhouses, as well as their roles in introducing alien species, have been investigated. There are some investigations about the importance of botanic gardens in the biological invasion process, but few centers on the same role that greenhouses play. This study pays more attention on the intermediate role of greenhouses in spreading alien species which can escape into neighboring habitats without appropriate supervision and management. The pest risk analysis and IPM should take greenhouses as a hotspot of invasive network, and more information on invasive species of greenhouse must be recorded and shared.
