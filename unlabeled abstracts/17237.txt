Spatio-temporal variation in seed predation by a native weevil in the invasive Prunus serotina
Invasive species may escape the enemies from their native range ('enemy release'), but they can also acquire new enemies in their introduced range, which will affect the invasion process. For the invasive tree species Prunus serotina, seed predation by the native weevil Furcipus rectirostris has been reported in forests in its introduced range. In this study, we quantified how common the infestation of P. serotina seeds by F. rectirostris is in a 4000 km2 area in northern Belgium. Seeds were sampled on P. serotina trees in different habitats and in two years, i.e., with low and high P. serotina fruit production. Infestation was found throughout the study region, in 43 and 62% of the sampled trees in the two years of the study; the maximum infestation levels of infested seed samples were 50 and 69%. Overall, predation occurred in 4.4 and 10.8% of the sampled seeds. The level of infestation differed between habitats and years, and the number of fruits per raceme was inversely related to the infestation level. Notwithstanding the rather high incidence of F. rectirostris infestation in our study, the impact on P. serotina's invasiveness might remain low seeing the overall high seed production and dispersal capacity of the species.
