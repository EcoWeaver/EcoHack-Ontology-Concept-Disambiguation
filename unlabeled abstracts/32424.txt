Warming alone increased exotic snail reproduction and together with eutrophication influenced snail growth in native wetlands but did not impact plants
Warming and eutrophication can have varying effects on exotic species performance and their interactions. These effects can vary with trophic level, but are rarely investigated simultaneously on exotic species from multiple trophic levels. To address this, we manipulated temperature, nutrients, and plant origin (native vs. exotic) in snail invaded wetland communities. Warming increased exotic apple snail (Pomacea maculata) reproduction (4-fold increase in egg mass) and also number of egg clutches produced while warming slowed exotic snail growth, suggesting a trade-off between reproduction and growth in exotic snails influenced by warming and nutrients. However, exotic snail size varied with warming and nutrients. Additionally, warming reduced native plant mass with no effect on exotic plants while nutrients had greater positive effects on exotic plants biomass. In combination warming and nutrient enrichment will likely increase exotic snail growth, while nutrient enrichment alone will contribute to exotic plant dominance. In conclusion, the individual and interactive effects of warming and eutrophication vary with the trophic level of exotic species with trade-offs in exotic herbivores depending on environmental conditions, making it difficult to predict effects of multiple anthropogenic factors on co-occurring exotic plants and their effects on native communities.
