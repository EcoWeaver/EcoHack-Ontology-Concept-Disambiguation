Tissue invasion of laboratory-reared Biomphalaria glabrata by a harpacticoid copepod
Copepods were observed in the tissues of 3 of 23 Biomphalaria glabrata snails examined histologically. All were heavily encapsulated by hemocytes and were dead. The copepods are most likely members of the order Harpacticoida, based on external morphology. This tissue invasion appears to be accidental rather than symbiotic or predatory, but could be a cause of observed mortality in laboratory snail colonies.
