Vodni mekkysi Sazavy a vybranych pritoku se zamerenim na ohrozene a nepuvodni druhy [Aquatic molluscs of the Sazava River and its selected tributaries with a focus on threatened and non-native species]
This paper presents the results of a malacological survey of the Sazava River and its tributaries conducted over the last 20 years. The Sazava River (Czech Republic, Central and Eastern Bohemia) is one of the major tributaries of the Vltava River. Altogether 45 species of aquatic molluscs were found at 221 sites located at the Sazava River and its tributaries. More than 60% of recorded species of the Sazava River and its tributaries are common and widespread. The population of critically endangered Margaritifera margaritifera in the Jankovsky potok is near extinction. Other threatened bivalves Pseudanodonta complanata, Unio crassus and Sphaerium rivicola were recorded in the Sazava River. Populations of U. crassus were also found in several tributaries (Blanice, Hejlovka, Martinicky potok) while in the Sazavka Brook and the Zelivka River only a few individuals were found. Gyraulus acronicus, a rare gastropod in the Czech Republic, was recorded in the Blanice River and several dam reservoirs. Four non-native species (Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Physa acuta, Gyraulus parvus, Dreissena polymorpha) were found in the monitored streams and reservoirs but usually in a relatively small number of localities. Most of these were located in the lower section of the Sazava River, Svihov dam reservoir and some tributaries.
