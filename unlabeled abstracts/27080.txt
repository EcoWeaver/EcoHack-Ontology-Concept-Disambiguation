Do exaptations facilitate mutualistic associations between invasive and native species?
As invasive species are key threats to ecosystem structure and function, it is essential to understand the factors underlying their success. Enigmatically, mutualistic organisms are often successful in colonizing novel environments even though they commonly persist only through intricate relationships with other species. Mutualistic ants, for example, protect aphids from natural enemies while collecting carbohydrate-rich honeydew. To facilitate this interaction, ants have evolved aggressive responses to aphid alarm pheromone emissions. As invasive and native mutualists have not evolved together, however, it is unclear if this form of cross-species communication exists between these two parties thereby facilitating these novel interactions. We address this hypothesis by assessing whether the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, responds to native poplar aphid, Chaitophorus populicola, alarm signals. Here, we show that interspecific signalling does exist in this newly established mutualistic interaction. Argentine ant workers exhibit increased aggression and double the number of visits to an aphid colony after an aphid alarm signal is emitted. We suggest that pre-adaptations may facilitate the emergence of mutualistic associations between many invasive and native species.
