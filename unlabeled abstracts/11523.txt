Laboratory study of effects of temperature and salinity on survival and larval development of a population of Rhithropanopeus harrisii from the Mondego River estuary, Portugal
Rhithropanopeus harrisii (Gould) is an introduced species in the estuary of the Mondego River (Portugal): it was first recorded from the Iberian Peninsula in 1989. The larval development of this population was studied under laboratory conditions at different temperatures and salinities, and showed a larval development pattern very similar to that reported for American estuarine populations of this species. Larval development was negatively correlated with temperature. Time to megalopa varied between 7 and 35 d; the first crab (C1) was reached after a maximum of 11 to 43 d. Larval development was optimum at 25degC and 15%0S. Larval survival was maximum at 10, 15 and 20%0S at all three temperatures studied (20, 25 and 30degC). The percentage of abnormal megalopae increased with increasing salinity to a maximum (100%) at 30%0S; incidence of abnormality was not affected by temperature.
