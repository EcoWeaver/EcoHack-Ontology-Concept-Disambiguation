Effects of Brassica nigra and plant-fungi interactions on the arthropod community of Deinandra fasciculata
While invasive plants are widely studied for their effects on native plants, we questioned how plant invasions affect higher trophic levels. We investigated the effects of the invasive plant, Brassica nigra on the multi-trophic arthropod community residing on the native California annual Deinandra fasciculata. In a common garden experiment, we planted D. fasciculata without B. nigra or with one of 45 B. nigra half-sib genetic families. We in turn crossed this B. nigra treatment with the suppression of soil fungi to both test for effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on arthropods, and elucidate the mechanisms of B. nigra's below ground effects. B. nigra had no effect on D. fasciculata traits (biomass, inflorescence number, root colonization by AMF), arthropod community composition or predator density, but increased herbivore density. While B. nigra families varied 18-fold in size, there was no genetic variation for effects on D. fasciculata or its arthropods. Soil fungi suppression had no effect on D. fasciculata traits, herbivore density or herbivore community composition, but increased predator density and altered predator community composition. While the exact mechanisms of B. nigra effects are unclear, they do not appear to have been mediated by altered plant performance or reductions in root colonization by AMF. Our experiment shows that invasive plants such as B. nigra may affect higher trophic levels even when they do not measurably affect native plant performance.
