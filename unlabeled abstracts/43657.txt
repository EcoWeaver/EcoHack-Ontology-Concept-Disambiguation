The effect of wilting or soaking on the nutritive value of two invasive weed species in Nepal
Goats are an important component of the livelihoods of resource poor livestock keepers (RPLK) in Nepal. A major constraint is the poor health (and low economic value) of goats in the early part of the wet season, and this is partly brought about by the shortage of available forage in the dry season. Two invasive weeds ( Eupatorium adenophorum , EA, and Chromolaena odorata , CO) now grow throughout Nepal. The plants grow year round, and so could be used as a source of forage, but their voluntary intake and perceived nutritive value by goats is low. If an appropriate means of treating EA and CO could be developed, their nutritive value may increase. EA and CO could then be included in the forage harvested for goats. The objective of this experiment was therefore to determine the effect on the nutritive value of EA and CO of either wilting or soaking these plants.
