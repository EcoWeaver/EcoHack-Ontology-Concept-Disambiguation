Status, distribution and conservation of two Madagascar bird species endemic to Lake Alaotra: Delacour's grebe Tachybaptus rufolavatus and Madagascar pochard Aythya innotata
Lake Alaotra constitutes the biggest lake in Madagascar and holds, almost exclusively, the range of two species of endemic bird, the Madagascar pochard Aythya innotata and Delacour's grebe Tachybaptus rufolavatus, both classified as endangered species. The Madagascar pochard had not been seen since 1971, and Delacour's grebe not since 1962. A survey made during September 1989-March 1990 did not find any evidence of these two species, thus they should be considered on the brink of extinction. However, an adult male Madagascar pochard was caught alive on Lake Alaotra in August 1991 and is currently held in captivity. An investigation of museum collections revealed that these two species are rare in collections and have almost all come from Lake Alaotra. The transformation of the natural habitat of Lake Alaotra for agricultural production, the practice of burning in the heart of aquatic vegetation, pressure of hunting and poaching, and the introduction of exotic species of fish and plants, provide explanations for the disappearance of these two birds. Recommendations to help protect the two species are proposed.
