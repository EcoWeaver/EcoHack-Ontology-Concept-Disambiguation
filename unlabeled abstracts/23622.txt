Restoring degraded arid Mediterranean areas with exotic tree species: Influence of an age sequence of Acacia salicina on soil and vegetation dynamics
Acacia salicina Lindl. is an Australian leguminous tree widely planted outside its original distribution as a multi-purpose species, and successfully establishes on degraded areas. The objective of this study was to determine how an age sequence of 3, 5, 9 and 13-year-old A. salicina plantations affected soil properties and flora diversity of an arid Mediterranean steppe. Soil samples were taken from the upper 10 cm of soil under tree canopies and in the associated open spaces. The results showed that tree establishment and development enhanced soil contents of total C, total N, available P and exchangeable K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+. These trends increased significantly with increasing plantation age. At the same time A. salicina facilitated the colonization and development of understory vegetation. Indeed, the number of plant species, the total plant cover, the perennial species density, the plant biomass and the diversity all attained higher values under tree canopies and increased with increasing plantation age. The soil dynamic under 13-year-old A. salicina plantations reflected two phases in the restoration sequence, characterized by nominal changes during tree establishment (0-5 years) and showing marked and rapid changes associated with the start of canopy closure (5-13 years). A. salicina establishment could be an effective and applicable measure to restore soil and vegetation and control desertification in the Mediterranean arid steppes.
