Expansion of the invasive Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) into Allegheny River tributaries: LeBoeuf and French Creeks in Pennsylvania
The Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is an invasive fish species currently found in all five of the Laurentian Great Lakes of the United States. Round gobies have previously been restricted to the Lake Erie watershed of Pennsylvania, however, in fall of 2014, they were discovered in portions of the upper Allegheny River watershed, specifically Lake LeBoeuf and LeBoeuf Creek. This introduction was likely via bait bucket transfer. This paper confirms additional records of Round Gobies, including age zero fish and males in breeding colors, in LeBoeuf Creek as well as in the main stem of French Creek, tributaries to the Allegheny River.
