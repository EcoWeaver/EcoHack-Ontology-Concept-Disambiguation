Global phylogenetics of Diuraphis noxia (Hemiptera: Aphididae), an invasive aphid species: evidence for multiple invasions into North America.
The Russian wheat aphid, Diruaphis noxia (Kudjumov) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is globally one of the most devastating pests of bread wheat, Tritium aestivum L., durum wheat, Triticum turgidum L., and barley, Hordeum vulgare L. Several sources of D. noxia resistance have been incorporated in commercial wheat and barley genotypes, but up to eight virulent biotypes, defined based on their ability to damage different wheat and barley genotypes, now occur across the western United States since the first appearance of D. noxia in North America in 1986. Critical to the study of D. noxia and other invasive species is an understanding of the number and origin of invasions that have occurred, as well as the rate or potential of postinvasion adaptation and geographic range expansion. The goal of this study was to determine whether D. noxia biotypes are by-products of a single invasion or multiple invasions into North America. We used the genome-wide technique of amplified fragment length polymorphisms, in combination with 22 collections of D. noxia from around the world, to assess this question, as well as patterns of genetic divergence. We found multiple lines of evidence that there have been at least two D. noxia invasions of different origin into North America, each resulting in subsequent postinvasion diversification that has since yielded multiple biotypes.
