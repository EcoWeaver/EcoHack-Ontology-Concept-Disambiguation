Rapid invasion of Indo-Pacific lionfishes Pterois volitans (Linnaeus, 1758) and P. miles (Bennett, 1828) in Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, Gulf of Mexico, documented in multiple data sets
Non-native red lionfish Pterois volitans (Linnaeus, 1758) and devil firefish Pterois miles (Bennett, 1828) have become established on continental shelf areas throughout the western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. Lionfish were first observed in the Gulf of Mexico in 2009, and sighted at Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) in 2011. We document the first appearance of lionfish and sighting frequency in FGBNMS using fish surveys from long-term monitoring data, diver sighting and removal data, and observations from Remotely Operated Vehicle surveys. Our results quantify and identify trends in lionfish density, biomass, and sighting frequency within the national marine sanctuary. Lionfish populations demonstrated different patterns among the three banks of FGBNMS. While lionfish have shown a steadily increasing trend at East Flower Garden Bank and West Flower Garden Bank from 2011 to 2014, populations decreased at Stetson Bank following the initial invasion. Because lionfish populations are projected to increase throughout the Gulf of Mexico, the continuation of long-term monitoring and volunteer diver programs with the combined analyses from multiple data sets similar to those used in this study are vital in early warning, detection, and documentation of invasive species and time-sensitive management issues.
