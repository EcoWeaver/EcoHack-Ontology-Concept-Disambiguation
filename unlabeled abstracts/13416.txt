Xylem vessel traits predict the leaf phenology of native and non-native understorey species of temperate deciduous forests
1.Non-native understory woody species have been shown to extend leaf display and inhabit vacant phenological niches in early spring and late autumn when growing with native counterparts in temperate deciduous forests across the world. Despite the potential competitive advantages, extended leaf duration also subjects non-native species to possible hydraulic risks associated with maintaining leaves during the periods of increased frost probability. It remains unclear how non-native species are able to maintain xylem function within this context.
