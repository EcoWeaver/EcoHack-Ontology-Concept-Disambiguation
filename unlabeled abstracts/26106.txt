Differential resistance to extended copper exposure in four introduced bryozoans
Resistance to copper by some fouling species may have the 2-fold effect of both facilitating the introduction of nonindigenous species via the painted hulls of vessels, and providing these species with a competitive advantage in ports or estuaries already exposed to anthropogenically elevated copper concentrations. This study tested the tolerance of 4 introduced bryozoans, Bugula neritina, Watersipora subtorquata, Schizoporella errata and Tricellaria occidentalis, to a range of Cu concentrations (0, 10, 50, 100 and 500 mu g l(-1)). Larval attachment after 24 h was not found to be a reliable indicator of post-inetamorphic survival. Recruits of all species survived in 0 and 10 mu g l(-1) Cu for 20 d, with only Bugula neritina and Watersipora subtorquata recruits surviving exposure to 50 and 100 mu g l(-1) Cu. B. neritina and W. subtorquata colonies exhibited reduced post-metamorphic growth in 50 mu g l(-1) Cu compared to controls, with no growth observed in 100 mu g l(-1) Cu. Growth for S, errata and T occidentalis was higher at 0 mu g l(-1) than 10 mu g l(-1) Cu. Post-exposure growth of surviving colonies was assessed by transplanting colonies to the field. W subtorquata colonies exposed to 50 mu g l(-1) Cu were the only colonies to show decreased survival and growth post Cu-exposure, Overall, B. neritina and W subtorquata showed the greatest tolerance to Cu. These findings have important implications for the management, control and assessment of invasion potential of these invasive marine hull-fouling species.
