HARMONIA AXYRIDIS (PALLAS, 1773) (COLEOPTERA: COCCINELLIDAE) IN MOSCOW CITY AND YALTA CITY: ITS COMPETITION WITH NATIVE SPECIES OF COCCINELLIDS AND THE INFLUENCE OF PARASITOIDS ON ITS NUMBER
The Asian ladybird Harmonia axyridis is an invasive species that is rapidly spreading around the world. Occupying new territories, H. axyridis often causes a decrease in the biodiversity of native species of coccinellids, competing with them for food resources. A comparison of H. axyridis with six species of ladybirds was made in terms of the ratio of the number of individuals and the degree of infestation with parasitoids. In Moscow city, the most widespread species of ladybirds was Adalia bipunctata (67.1%), H. axyridis ranks second (16.5%). The total infestation of H. axyridis pupae with parasitoids is 1.8% in Moscow city and 12.2% in Yalta city. Infestation with parasitoids of other ladybird species in Moscow city is much higher: from 11.0% to 36.4%. Thus, parasitoids effectively regulate the number of native ladybird species, but have an insignificant effect on the number of the invasive species H. axyridis .
