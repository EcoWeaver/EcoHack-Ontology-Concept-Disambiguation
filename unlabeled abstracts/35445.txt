Character Displacement and Habitat Shift in a Native Cisco in Southeastern Lake Michigan: Evidence for Competition?
The decline of several planktivorous fishes in Lake Michigan following the invasion of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) has often been attributed to competition for zooplankton. But shifts in resource use or trophic morphology by native fishes have not been well documented. In the 19 years following the increase of alewife, gill rakers of a native cisco, bloater (Coregonus hoyi), from southeastern Lake Michigan were significantly reduced both in number (by 2.1) and length (by 15%). In addition, bloaters now shift to bottom habitats and benthic prey as much as 2 years earlier in their life history than before alewife became abundant. Though the causal factors for these shifts are difficult to document, the idea that they are due to selection for benthic foraging efficiency in response to alewife competition is favored by the existing data.
