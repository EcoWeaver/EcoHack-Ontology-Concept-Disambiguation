Synergistic effect of insect herbivory and plant parasitism on the performance of the invasive treeSchinus terebinthifolius
Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (Anacardiaceae) is an introduced tree from South America that has invaded many ecosystems throughout central and south Florida, USA. Exploratory surveys in the plant's native range identified several potential biocontrol agents, including the leaflet rolling moth, Episimus unguiculus Clarke (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). The larval stages of E. unguiculus tie together the plant leaflets while feeding and can completely defoliate small plants. The native love vine, Cassytha filiformis L. (Lauraceae), has been found parasitizing S. terebinthifolius in Florida. Natural processes such as plant parasitism may be one of the components of an integrated approach for S. terebinthifolius management in Florida. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the combined effects of insect herbivory and plant parasitism on the performance of S. terebinthifolius. A factorial design experiment was conducted in the greenhouse to determine the effect of C. filiformis parasitism and E. unguiculus feeding damage on the growth and biomass of S. terebinthifolius. Results showed that plant parameters, including leaflet biomass, growth rate, and flower production, were negatively affected by plant parasitism and insect herbivory. Moreover, the decrease in S. terebinthifolius performance was greater when these two factors were combined, indicative of a synergistic relationship. In addition, the combined effect of C. filiformis and E. unguiculus suppressed plant performance for at least 2 months after the moths were removed. Therefore, increased control of S. terebinthifolius stands may be achieved in those areas where C. filiformis is present in Florida (e.g., pinelands, hammock forests) if the biocontrol agent E. unguiculus is approved for release.
