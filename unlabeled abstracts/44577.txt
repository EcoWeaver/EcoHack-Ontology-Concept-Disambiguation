Insecticidal Activities of the Leaf Extract of the Invasive Alien Plant, Chromolaena odorata (L.) (Asteraceae) Against Macrotermes species (Termites)
Several studies have demonstrated the biological efficacy of leaf, stem and root powders or extracts of Chromolaena odorata (L.) King and Robinson against insect pests but those that are focused on the biological efficacy of aqueous leaf extracts against Macrotermes species are scanty. Current management of termites with synthetic insecticides is being discouraged due to human and environmental hazards. Therefore, the insecticidal effectiveness of aqueous leaf extract C. odorata against Macrotermes species was investigated. Five concentrations (0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0% (w/v)) of the aqueous extract of C. odorata plant were evaluated for repellency and toxicity on the worker caste of Macrotermes species following standard procedures. The filter paper impregnation technique was used for the bioassay. Percentage repellency was monitored for 30 minutes and mortality recorded at 12, 24 and 36 hours post exposure. The leaf extract of C. odorata significantly repelled 95% of Macrotermes species at the highest concentration of 10% (w/v) after 30 minutes post treatment exposure. Mortality of Macrotermes species was independent of treatment concentration, but dependent on duration of exposure. All treatment concentrations of aqueous leaf extract of C. odorata caused significant mortality against Macrotermes species ranging between 94% and 98% compared to the control; indicating very great potential for adoption and use in the management of Macrotermes species.
