Profiling insular vertebrates prone to biological invasions: What makes them vulnerable?
Invasive alien species (IAS) are a major threat to insular vertebrates, although the ecological characteristics that make insular communities vulnerable to IAS are poorly understood. After describing the ecological strategies of 6015 insular amphibians, birds, lizards, and mammals, we assessed the functional and ecological features of vertebrates exposed to IAS. We found that at least 50% of insular amphibian functional richness was hosted by IAS-threatened amphibians and up to 29% for birds. Moreover, all IAS-threatened groups except birds harbored a higher functional richness than species groups threatened by other threats. Disentangling the ecological strategies threatened by IAS, compared to those associated with other threats, we showed that birds, lizards, and mammals were more likely to be terrestrial foragers and amphibians to have larval development. By contrast, large-bodied species and habitat specialists were universally threatened. By considering the functional aspect of threatened insular diversity, our work improves our understanding of global IAS impacts. This new dimension proves essential for undertaking relevant and effective conservation actions. Invasive alien species (IAS) are a major threat to insular vertebrates. Using the ecological strategies of 6015 insular amphibians, birds, lizards and mammals, we assessed the functional and ecological features of vertebrates exposed to IAS. We found that among all insular endemic terrestrial vertebrates those threatened by IAS host a high amount of functional richness. Moreover, we showed that such species harbor specific features of vulnerability to biological invasions in addition to general features of vulnerability to global threats.
