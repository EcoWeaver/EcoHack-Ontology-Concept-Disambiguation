Marine pests in paradise: capacity building, awareness raising and preliminary introduced species port survey results in the Republic of Palau
Introduced marine species can have a large impact upon small countries that are reliant on marine tourism. Non-governmental organisations, such as the World Conservation Union (IUCN), are working with technical experts to implement capacity building and awareness programs that transfers introduced marine species knowledge to countries in need of aid. The Republic of Palau is reliant on tourism and as such is pro-actively engaging in this process to ensure that it has the necessary skills to determine and manage its introduced marine species pathways and vectors. The IUCN with the aid of technical experts implemented a four day training workshop that provided both theoretical and practical field experience with introduced marine species port surveys. An outcome of this exercise was the detection of 11 introduced marine species, the training of 10 Palau agencies and two international organisations, and recommendations for future implementation that will aid Palau to address the problem of introduced marine species within their borders.
