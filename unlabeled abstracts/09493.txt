Isolation and characterization of nine microsatellite markers for Brachypodium sylvaticum (Huds.) Beauv., a recently invasive grass species in Oregon.
The patterns of genetic diversity caused by rapid range expansions following recent colonizations are best observed using highly polymorphic genetic markers. We characterized nine microsatellite markers for Brachypodium sylvaticum, a bunchgrass invasive in the Northwestern United States and native to Eurasia. Loci exhibited from two to 10 alleles, and generally had high F(IS) values. These loci will help identify sources of new populations in the region, and they will be useful for studying patterns of genetic diversity during rapid range expansions.
