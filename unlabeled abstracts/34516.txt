Vegetation Changes as a Result of Invasion of Forest on Krasnozem by Phytophthora cinnamomi
Disease caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi was studied for 5 years in native and planted forest growing on krasnozem in the northern foothills of the Great Dividing Range at Narbethong, 100 km northwest of Melbourne. Changes in species composition were recorded for three sites carrying mature dry sclerophyll forest of Eucalyptus obliqua and Eucalyptus radiata, young plantations of E. obliqua, and young plantations of Pinus radiata. The mature ecualypts were diseased in 1974 and now are gradually dying. The young E. obliqua showed greater resistance than the older trees to the pathogen but infected trees were characterized by lower height, small leaves with reduced water potential, and an increased susceptibility to the leaf spot fungus Aulographina eucalypti. Susceptible understorey species such as Tetratheca ciliata and Epacris impressa died, but seedling regeneration of these has since occurred on one site. No species has disappeared from all three sites but T. ciliata and Daviesia latifolia almost disappeared from site 2, and the total number of plants was reduced. Species such as Leptospermum juniperinum and Platylobium formosum developed fluctuating cycles of chlorosis and die-back followed by either recovery or death. Resistant plants such as sedges, grasses and Acacia dealbata invaded the diseased forest. During the first year of the investigation 13% of the 4-year-old Pinus radiata died, but this particular site was well drained, warmer and drier than the others and the surviving pines later grew vigorously and crowded out other species. Symptoms are no longer evident on this site. The future status of the mature forest and the probable effects of disease on the young E. obliqua plantation are discussed.
