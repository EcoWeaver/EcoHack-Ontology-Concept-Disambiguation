Spatial patterns of epifaunal communities in San Francisco Bay eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds
Epifaunal invertebrate species, such as amphipods and isopods, have been shown to play key but varying roles in the functioning of seagrass habitats. In this study, we characterized patterns in the poorly known epifaunal communities in eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds in San Francisco Bay as a first step in understanding the individual and collective importance of these species, while testing predictions on spatial patterns derived from previous studies in other regions. Surveys conducted at five beds across multiple time periods (April, June, August and October 2007) showed that San Francisco Bay eelgrass beds varied strongly in epifaunal community composition, total, and relative abundance, and that abundance differed markedly among time periods. In contrast to findings by others, morphologically complex flowering shoots frequently harbored greater numbers of epifauna (>2x and up to 10x more individuals) than vegetative shoots, but not different species assemblages. Similar to previous studies, several abiotic factors did not explain patterns in distribution and abundance among beds. The proportion of introduced species was very high (>90% of all individuals), a finding unique among seagrass epifaunal studies to date. Defining numerical patterns in epifaunal communities will inform related efforts to understand effects of epifaunal species and assemblages on eelgrass growth dynamics, seed production, and higher order trophic interactions over space and time.
