Seasonal distribution of the invasive snail, Bithynia tentaculata, within infested waterbodies in Minnesota, USA, including waterfowl migration
The introduction of the invasive faucet snail (Bithynia tentaculata) and its associated trematodes, Cyathocotyle bushiensis, Sphaeridiotrema spp., and Leyogonimus polyoon, has resulted in recurring waterfowl die-offs during spring and fall migration in the Great Lakes Region, especially of Lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and American coots (Fulica americana). Here we evaluated faucet snail habitat use and abundance in infested waterbodies in northcentral Minnesota (USA) during spring, summer, and fall of 2011-2013. We collected snail samples, along with data on abiotic and biotic variables, at 12 snail-infested waterbodies. We used Generalized Estimating Equations to develop models that explain variability in the distribution and abundance of snails within waterbodies. Models containing water depth consistently received considerable support in waterbodies where depth varied substantially; however the specific shape of these relationships varied among waterbodies. Snails used a wide range of depths, but were more likely to be present in deep portions (~6 m) of large lakes in all seasons. We found seasonal differences in the location of rafts of migrating scaup, with use of areas closer to shore in the spring, and use of areas shallower than those used most by faucet snails. Patterns in snail distribution likely influenced the availability of snails for consumption by migrating waterfowl; differences in portions of large lakes used by migratory waterfowl as stopover sites and by faucet snails may reduce exposure of migrating waterfowl to trematodes in infested lakes. However, some spatio-temporal overlap between snails and scaup occurs and explains the continuing loss of waterfowl to trematodiasis.
