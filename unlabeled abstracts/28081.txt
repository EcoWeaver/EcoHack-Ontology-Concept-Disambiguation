Trophic niche partitioning between two native and two exotic carnivores in SW Portugal
During past centuries, the increases of human mobility and activities (e.g. agriculture, aquaculture, recreation and transportation) have caused the introduction of species to different geographic areas (Sutherland 1998, Kolar and Lodge 2001). Species are termed as exotic or non-native when they have not evolved in a given geographic area, and have been accidentally introduced or brought for a specific purpose (Sutherland 1998). Exotic species success is usu-ally measured by the extinction of native species and the potential to alter the environment or pose serious threats to human health (Primack 1998). Smallwood (1994) has shown that birds and mammals site invasibility in Califor-nian habitats is directly related to the degree of human dis-turbance at a site when exotics arrive, with native mam-mals' richer areas being less prompt for exotic success. The common genet Genetta genetta and the Egyptian mongoose Herpestes ichneumon are two species of African mesocarnivores, introduced in the Iberian Peninsula (Dob-son 1998). The earliest remains of common genet in Europe date to the Middle Ages (Dobson 1998) and the first records of Egyptian mongoose are from the latest 1800s (Delibes 1982). Presently, the common genet is distributed through-out the Iberian Peninsula and south of France (Livet and Roeder 1987, Calzada 2002), whereas the Egyptian mon-goose is limited to the SW of the Iberian Peninsula (De-libes 1982, Borralho et al. 1996, Palomares 2002).
