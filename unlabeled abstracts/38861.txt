Spreading and Distribution of Lactuca scariola, Invasive Alien Plant, by Habitat Types in Korea
This study was carried out to investigate the distribution and habitat types of prickly lettuce, Lactuca scariola of Europe origin for supplying the basic data of management plan. It showed fairly nation-wide distribution although excessive growth was rather limited in the wild. Its habitat types were divided into four types like open fields, roadsides, seashores and riversides. Species diversity examined by species rank-dominance curve tended to increase over riverside > seashores > open fields > roadsides. As a result of analyzing life form, therophytes were more than 50%, means that the habitats of L. scariola were disturbed by human activities etc. Urbanization Index was analyzed 9.1% in roadsides, 7.4% in seashores, 5.8% in open fields and riversides. It has high spread potential with a large number of wind-flying seed per plant. It was evaluated that prickly lettuce was mainly spread along the newly constructed road, expressway and invaded the original ecosystem in the cultivated land as weeds. But it has played a role as a pioneer species in open fields. It is recommended to remove where it has considerable impact on the native plant species of conservation value.
