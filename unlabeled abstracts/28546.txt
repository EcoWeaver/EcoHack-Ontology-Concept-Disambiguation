Modeling Management Options for Controlling the Invasive Zebra Mussel in a Mediterranean Reservoir
The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is among the most invasive organisms worldwide, with well-documented economic and ecological impacts. In Spain, it was first detected in the Riba-roja Reservoir (Ebro River) in the summer of 2001. Although it has been suggested that mussel density determines its invasiveness and impact, there are few studies on what factors are responsible for population dynamics (i.e.; variations over space and time). The model used here was able to reproduce all population dynamics previously described in the literature; therefore, it was used to predict future mussel population trends within the Riba-roja Reservoir and test the usefulness of water-level fluctuations as a mussel management tool. Carrying capacity was based on total phosphorus concentration and was found to control peak density. Consequently, if the decrease in phosphorus observed in the basin remains at its present level, an increase in mussel density is not expected. A decrease in the water level (simulated through an increment in mortality rates) had a significant effect on mussel dynamics. Population response was related to mussel density, age-class composition, and its reproductive cycle. Population response capability was reduced outside of the spawning season and effects were higher when two water releases were combined, one before the spawning season and a second after the next spawning season. Model predictions at a local scale may be helpful in developing adequate control plans by both predicting future species trends and forecasting management effects.
