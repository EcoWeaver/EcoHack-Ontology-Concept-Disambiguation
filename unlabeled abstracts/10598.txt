Laboratory selection of chlorpyrifos resistance in an Invasive Pest, Phenacoccus solenopsis (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae): Cross-resistance, stability and fitness cost
The cotton mealybug,Phenacoccus solenopsisis an important polyphagous sucking pest of ornamentals, horticultural andfiber crops worldwide. SomeP. solenopsispopulations have developed insecticide resistance. This study evaluated cross-resistance, stability of insecticide resistance and life history traits affected by chlorpyrifos resistance inP. solenopsis. After nine generations selected with chlorpyrifos,P. solenopsisexhibited a 539.76-fold resistance level compared to an unselected population (UNSEL Pop). Chlorpyrifos selected population (Chlor-SEL Pop) displayed moderate cross-resistance to profenofos, nitenpyram and high cross-resistance to lambdacyhalothrin. Biological parameters ofP. Solenopsiswere affected by chlorpyrifos resistance. The Chlor-SEL Pop had a significant reduction infitness (relativefitness = 0.10), along with significant decreases in pupal weight, fecundity, egg hatching %, intrinsic rate of natural population increase, biotic potential, and mean relative growth rate. It is concluded that selection with chlorpyrifos had marked effect on resistance development inP. solenopsis and upon removal of selection pressure chlorpyrifos resistance declined significantly indicating unstable resistance. Development of resistance led to highfitness costs for the chlorpyrifos-selected strain. Thesefindings should be helpful for better and more successful resistance management ofP. solenopsis.
