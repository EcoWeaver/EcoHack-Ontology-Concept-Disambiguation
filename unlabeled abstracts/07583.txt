Antioxidant response of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica when epiphytized by the invasive macroalgae Lophocladia lallemandii.
The aim was to evaluate the antioxidant defences and the occurrence of oxidative damage in Posidonia oceanica under a stress situation due to the epiphytism of the invasive macroalgae Lophocladia lallemandii. P. oceanica leaves were collected in the absence (control station) and in the presence of the epiphytic algae L. lallemandii and the antioxidant enzyme activities, markers of oxidative damage, and hydrogen peroxide production were determined. Antioxidant enzyme--catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase--activities were significantly higher in Posidonia epiphytized by L. lallemandii. Malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl derivates, and glutathione levels were also higher in L. lallemandii epiphytized P. oceanica leaves compared to control samples. The production of hydrogen peroxide was also significantly increased when Posidonia was epiphytized by L. lallemandii. The invasion of P. oceanica meadows by L. lallemandii appeared to induce oxidative stress in the seagrass as evidenced by increased levels of oxidative stress markers and antioxidant defences.
