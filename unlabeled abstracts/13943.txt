Land cover of individual catchments was principally sand dunes and scrub, plantation forest, pasture, or a mixture of plantation forest and pasture. Sampling was concentrated in the sedge beds, submerged macrophytes and surface sediment layers of the littoral zone. Sixty-eight invertebrate taxa were recorded, 11-30 per lake. Relative abundance of major faunal groups differed considerably among lakes but a core group of common species was found in three quarters of them. Neither community composition, nor various measures of species richness were related significantly to catchment land cover classes. A feature of the lake fauna was the occurrence of three introduced species of Gastropoda and eight self-introduced insect species, including five dragonflies. One of the latter, Hemicordulia australiae, was found in all lakes and made up 3% of all invertebrates collected.
