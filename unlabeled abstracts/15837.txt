Age and body size in four introduced populations of the American bullfrog, Lithobates catesbeianus (Ranidae)
The American bullfrog, native to the eastern half of North America including southern Quebec, is considered one of the most invasive species in the world. It has been introduced in America, Asia and Europe, mainly for food purposes. A study on the age and body size of this species was carried out on individuals obtained from four introduced populations (one from Western Canada and three from France), using the skeletochronological method. Adults did not differ between sexes in mean body size or mean age, with the exception of one population in France where males were younger than females. Several differences in the mean age and body size were observed, with the individuals from the population in Canada exhibiting the highest values for both sexes. The scarcity of studies in the native range prevents the comparison of introduced versus native populations, and we focus on comparisons between introduced populations.
