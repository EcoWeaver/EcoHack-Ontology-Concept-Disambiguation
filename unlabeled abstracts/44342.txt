Impacts of the biological invasion by Ricinus communis L. on the native biota of the Atlantic Forest, Aracaju, Sergipe State, Brazil
The existence of environmental disturbances is an important facilitating factor to the establishment of biological invasions (BI). Biological invasions are considered the second biggest threat to the planet's biodiversity, behind only anthropic actions such as deforestation and habitat fragmentation. Thus, all environments are subjected to biological invasions, including Conservation Units (CU). The objective of the work was to evaluate the impacts of the exotic invasive Ricinus communis L. on the native biota of the Morro do Urubu Environmental Protection Area, Aracaju, Sergipe State, Brazil. Plots were allocated in places invaded by exotic invasive and in non-invaded places. Within the sample units, the number of individuals of each species present was counted. With these data, the statistics of the present study were performed. In the plots plotted on the non-invaded sites, 28 species were found. In the plots plotted on the invaded sites, only three species were sampled, among them the exotic invader studied, which showed to be the most abundant taxon in the area. In total, 75 individuals were counted in the invaded sites, of which 72 were from R. communis. In the non-invaded sites, 210 individuals. The average number of species was statistically higher in the plots where the exotic invader was removed, while from the second reading and remained until the eighth reading, the same happened for the average number of individuals. The results of this study showed the impacts caused by invasive exotic Ricinus communis on the composition, richness, diversity and resilience of an invaded Atlantic Forest area.
