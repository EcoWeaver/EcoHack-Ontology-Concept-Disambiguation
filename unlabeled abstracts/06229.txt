Cadmium bioaccumulates after acute exposure but has no effect on locomotion or shelter-seeking behaviour in the invasive green shore crab (Carcinus maenas)
Cadmium (Cd 2+) is a non-essential metal ubiquitous in the environment due to industrial processes. However, little is known regarding the ability of Cd 2+ to impact the behaviour of aquatic animals in receiving environments. Green shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) were exposed to waterborne Cd 2+ [control (no Cd 2+), low (0.30 mmol/L), medium (3.3 mmol/L) and high (63 mmol/L)], for 24 h, then, crabs were placed in an open field and shelter test to determine potential changes in loco-motion and preference for shelter. Tissues (gill, haemolymph, stomatogastric ganglion) were taken for bioaccumulation analysis of Cd 2+ and ion content. Behavioural testing was recorded with a motion-tracking software system and showed no impact of Cd 2+ on any variable in either of the tests used. All three tissues accumulated Cd 2+ in a concentration-dependent manner. Crabs exposed to low Cd 2+ showed a small but significant decrease in haemolymph Ca 2+ , however, this effect was not present at higher Cd 2+ exposures. Overall, the results indicate that short-term Cd 2+ exposure, and the resulting Cd 2+ accumulation, had no effect on locomotor and anxiety-related behaviour of green shore crabs.
