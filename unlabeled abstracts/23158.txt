Comparison of life history traits between invasive and native populations of purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) using nonlinear mixed effects model
We compared growth patterns of invasive and native populations of purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) while varying water and nutrient levels. We examined three life-history traits (height, number of branches, and the size of largest leaf) during the growth period adopting a nonlinear mixed effects model. Invasive populations were found to be slower in shoot elongation but grew to be taller than native populations. Invasive populations produced more branches than natives only in the high water, high nutrient treatment. Invasive populations had a similar increase in the size of the largest leaf compared to natives, but ultimately produced a greater size of largest leaf than natives. Invasive populations were found to display a greater vegetative expansion, but this was not strongly affected by our treatments.
