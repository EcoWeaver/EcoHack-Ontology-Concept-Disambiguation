Distribution and long-term temporal patterns of four invasive colonial ascidians in the Gulf of Maine
Invasive ascidians are a growing concern for ecologists and natural resource managers, yet few studies have documented their short- and long-term temporal patterns of abundance. This study focuses on the invasion of the Gulf of Maine by the colonial ascidians Botryllus schlosseri, Botrylloides violaceus, Diplosoma listerianum and Didemnum sp. A. We examined the time of arrival and potential vectors for these four invasive ascidians using survey data (collected from 1969 onwards) and literature documentation. We also compared the dominance and seasonal patterns of abundance of these species using data from two identical panel studies; one conducted from 1979 to 1980, the other from 2003 to 2005. Didemnum and Botrylloides were most likely first introduced into the Damariscotta River, Maine in the early 1970's through oyster aquaculture while Botryllus and Diplosoma were probably transported by commercial and recreational vessels. The overall abundance of colonial ascidians has increased since 1979 and 1980. Botryllus was the only invasive colonial ascidian present during the 1979 to 1980 study and accounted for an average of 6.16% cover on panels. From 2003 to 2005, the more recently arrived colonial ascidians Botrylloides and Didemnum accounted for 7.38% and 2.08% cover respectively, while Botryllus covered only 1.16%. Our results reveal a shift in seasonal abundance between 1979 to 1980 and 2003 to 2004. In 1979 and 1980, colonial ascidians had the highest percent cover in fall and winter while in 2003 and 2005 they had highest percent cover in summer and fall. Seasonal patterns of space occupation by colonial ascidians were correlated with seasonal changes in seawater temperature.
