A revisit to the diffusive logistic model with free boundary condition
This short paper revisits a free boundary problem which is used to describe the spreading of a new or invasive species. Our main goal is to understand how the underlying long-time dynamical behaviors response to the initial data. To this end, we parameterize the initial function as u0 = do *, where d is regarded as a variable parameter and o * is a given function. Our main result suggests that when the diffusion rate is small, the species can persist in the long run (called spreading) for any s > 0; while if the diffusion rate is large, the species will go to extinction finally (called vanishing) for small d > 0. Maybe of more interest is that for some intermediate diffusion rates, there appears a sharp threshold value d * (0, 8) such that vanishing happens provided 0 < s = d * and spreading happens provided s > d *. This result can be seen as an improvement of Theorem 1.2 in [8].
