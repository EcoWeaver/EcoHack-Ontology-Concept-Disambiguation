Body size evolution in insular vertebrates: generality of the island rule
Aim My goals here are to (1) assess the generality of the island rule - the graded trend from gigantism in small species to dwarfism in larger species - for mammals and other terrestrial vertebrates on islands and island-like ecosystems; (2) explore some related patterns of body size variation in insular vertebrates, in particular variation in body size as a function of island area and isolation; (3) offer causal explanations for these patterns; and (4) identify promising areas for future studies on body size evolution in insular vertebrates.
