Evolution of resistance to satyrization through reproductive character displacement in populations of invasive dengue vectors
Recently, the highly invasive Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, rapidly displaced resident populations of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti in the southeastern United States and in Bermuda. Although multiple mechanisms of competitive displacement have been hypothesized, recent evidence of cross-insemination between these species in nature and the sterilizing effects of male accessory gland products asymmetrically favoring A . albopictus in interspecific matings support a role for satyrization (a form of reproductive interference) to explain the rapid displacements. Because of the drastic reproductive loss of A . aegypti females satyrized by A . albopictus males, we predicted selection for prezygotic isolation in populations of A . aegypti sympatric with A . albopictus . Exposures in cages demonstrated that female A . aegypti from populations in Florida sympatric with A . albopictus for the past 20 y were significantly less likely than nearby allopatric populations to mate with heterospecific males. Cross-inseminations of A . albopictus females by A . aegypti males were significantly less common, supporting the one-way direction of displacements observed in nature. Our results indicate rapid sexual selection leading to reproductive character displacement and the potential for satyr-resistant A . aegypti to recover from competitive displacements. These results have implications for increased risks of dengue transmission where these vector species meet worldwide.
