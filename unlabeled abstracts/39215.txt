The effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration on the biological control of invasive aquatic weeds
There has been a rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, from pre-industrial values of 280 ppm to more than 400 ppm currently, and this is expected to double by the end of the 21st century. Studies have shown that plants grown at elevated CO2 concentrations have increased growth rates and invest more in carbon-based defences. This has important implications for the management of invasive alien plants, especially using biological control which is mostly dependent on herbivorous insects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on the biological control of four invasive aquatic weeds (Azolla filiculoides, Salvinia molesta, Pistia stratiotes and Myriophyllum aquaticum). These species are currently under successful control by their respective biological control agents (Stenopelmus rufinasus, Cyrtobagous salviniae, Neohydronomus affinis, and Lysathia sp.) in South Africa. The plant species were grown in a two factorial design experiment, where atmospheric CO2 concentrations were set at ambient (400 ppm) or elevated (800 ppm), and plants were either subjected to or not subjected to herbivory by their target biological control agents. There was an overall increase in biomass production and C:N across all species at elevated CO2, both in the absence and presence of biological control, although C:N of M. aquaticum and biomass of A. filiculoides with herbivory were not constant with this trend. Insect feeding damage was reduced by elevated CO2, except for S. molesta. Thus, we can expect that plants will respond differently to CO2 increase, but the general trend suggests that these species will become more challenging to manage through biological control in future.
