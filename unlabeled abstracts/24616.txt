Diel interactions between prey behaviour and feeding in an invasive fish, the round goby, in a North American river
1. We studied the diet of the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) on a diel basis in the Flint River, a warmwater stream in Michigan, U.S.A. Diet and available prey samples were collected seven times over a 24 h period in four consecutive months. The section of river studied lacked zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), the primary prey of adult round gobies elsewhere in the Great Lakes region. 2. Diet changed on a diel basis with hydropsychid caddisfly and chironomid larvae predominating during the day, chironomid pupae dominating in the evening and heptageniid mayflies dominating at night. Simultaneous study of macroinvertebrate drift suggested that caddisfly and chironomid larvae were most likely picked from submerged rocks, chironomid pupae were most likely taken during their emergent ascent and mayflies were either captured from the drift or picked from rocks. 3. The Flint River lacks a diverse darter (Family: Percidae) and sculpin (Family: Cottidae) fauna and it appears that the round goby has occupied a generalised darter/sculpin niche. Our results indicate that round gobies have the potential to invade successfully riverine systems, particularly those lacking a diverse benthic fish assemblage.
