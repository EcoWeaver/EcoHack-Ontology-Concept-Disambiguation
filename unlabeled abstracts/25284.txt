Examining the colonization process of exotic species varying in competitive abilities using a cellular automaton model
Current threats of invasive species have significant implications for ecological systems. Given their potential impacts, invasive species have been the subject of extensive empirical and theoretical studies. However, these studies have tended to focus on species that produce highly visible ecological and economic impacts. In our study, we take a step back from focusing on these high-impact invasive species, and examine the general colonization (invasion) process of exotic species that have various "competitive abilities" against the native species. Using a two-species cellular automaton model, we demonstrate that: (1) a threshold level of competitive ability is required for the exotic species to successfully establish in a new landscape and (2) an exotic species with superior competitive ability does not necessarily become dominant in a landscape (alternatively, a species that has inferior competitive ability may successfully colonize a new system). Our findings have significant implications for the study of species invasions and also provide clues to how species assemble in ecological communities.
