Genotypic diversity of Wolbachia pipientis in native and invasive Harmonia axyridis Pall., 1773 (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) populations
The distribution and variability of reproductive symbiotic Wolbachia pipientis bacteria were studied in seven native and six invasive H. axyridis populations. Wolbachia-infected individuals were found in two invasive and two native populations. We demonstrated for the first time an infection of invasive H. axyridis populations with Wolbachia. Two new molecular forms of Wolbachia were detected by a system of multilocus typing. The supergroup A Wolbachia was found for the first time in H. axyridis. The detected genotypic diversity of Wolbachia indicates repeated and independent infection events in the evolutionary past of H. axyridis.
