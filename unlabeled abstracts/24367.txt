Effects of Prebaiting on Small Mammal Trapping Success in a Morrow's Honeysuckle-Dominated Area
Researchers have obtained mixed results in studies that use prebaiting to enhance small mammal trapping success. In 2004-2005 we tested the effects of prebaiting on small mammal trapping success in an exotic and invasive shrub community, Morrow's honeysuckle (Lonicera morrowii), using 4 80 x 120-m live trapping grids at Fort Necessity National Battlefield in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, USA. We randomly assigned traps to 1 of 3 trapping methods: we prebaited one-third of the traps 2 nights (n = 3,508 trap-nights), one-third one night (n = 3,492 trap-nights), and one-third had no prebaiting (n = 3,509 trap-nights). We compared small mammal richness, diversity, and relative abundance (no. captures/100 trap-nights) of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus; n = 462 captures), meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus; n = 89 captures), meadow jumping mice (Zapus hudsonius; n = 221 captures), masked shrews (Sorex cinereus; n = 87 captures), and shorttail shrews (Blarina brevicauda; n = 78 captures) among prebaited traps and non-prebaited traps. On the first day of trapping, as well as all 4 days combined, richness, diversity, and relative abundance for all species were similar among traps that we had prebaited for 2 nights, one night, and zero nights (P = 0.856). Moreover, total number of captures was similar among prebaiting treatments (P = 0.197). These results suggest that prebaiting does not enhance trapping success for small mammals in a landscape dominated by a dense, exotic shrub. We recommend that managers do not employ prebaiting in areas with similar small mammal species composition in an attempt to increase trapping success, as we did not record a difference in trapping success in prebaited traps compared to non-prebaited traps.
