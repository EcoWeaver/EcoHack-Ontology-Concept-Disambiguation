Can bite force be used as a basis for niche separation between native peccaries and introduced feral pigs in the Brazilian Pantanal?
The white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), collared pec-cary (Pecari tajacu) and introduced feral pig (Sus scrofa) occur sympatrically in the Brazilian Pantanal. The feral pig was introduced to the region approximately 200 years ago, whereas the peccaries are native to the region. The white-lipped peccary and collared peccary occur sym-patrically over a large part of their geographical range (Sowls 1997). Bite force has been suggested as a basis for niche differentiation between the two species of pec-caries in the Peruvian rainforest (Kiltie 1982). Both species of peccaries are efficient seed predators because their powerful bite force enables them to crack seeds, whereas small seeds or very hard seeds are swallowed whole or spat out (Kiltie 1981b, Bodmer 1991, Beck 2005, Keuroghlian and Eaton 2008). Using skull measurements and a lever model of jaw action, Kiltie (1982) found that the maximum potential bite force of the col-lared peccary was less than that of the white-lipped pec-cary and suggested that the white-lipped peccary consumes harder seeds that the collared peccary cannot crack. Field observations and trials in confinement seem to confirm this (Kiltie 1982). In another study Bodmer (1991) found hard seeds within 91% of white-lipped pec-cary stomachs and within 43% of collared peccary stomachs. Separation of diet based on the hardness of at least one species of palm seed was also reported in the northern Brazilian Amazon (Fragoso 1999). Finally, in the Atlantic forest white-lipped peccaries consumed and pre-dated the hard palmito fruits Euterpe edulis and collared peccaries did not (Keuroghlian and Eaton 2008).
