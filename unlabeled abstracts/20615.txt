SNP diversity in introduced populations of the invasive Gambusia holbrooki
Abstract - We used a targeted gene approach to amplify genomic fragments to characterise single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in introduced European populations of the invasive mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki. Patterns of diversity within and among European populations of G. holbrooki and American collections of G. holbrooki and Gambusia affinis reveal unexpected high diversities within European populations. This ascertainment bias is one of the major challenges in the development of SNP markers for monitoring species involved in worldwide introductions. Pattern of diversity among European populations confirmed diverse introductions, as suggested by earlier mtDNA studies. However, SNPs showed larger differentiation between populations than had been previously detected with mtDNA sequencing. Five major population groups were identified: central France, southern Iberian, northern Iberian, Eastern Europe and Mediterranean French Rivers.
