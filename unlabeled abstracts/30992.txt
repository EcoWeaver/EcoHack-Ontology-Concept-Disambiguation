The introduced bivalve Limnoperna fortunei boosts Microcystis growth in Salto Grande reservoir (Argentina): evidence from mesocosm experiments
In order to assess the effects of the introduced bivalve Limnoperna fortunei on water-column properties of Salto Grande reservoir, experiments were conducted using six 400 L mesocosms: 2 with 100 mussels, 2 with 300 mussels, and 2 controls (without mussels). At 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days we measured nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations, counted and identified the phytoplankton, and estimated the density, size, and number of cells of the colonies of Microcystis spp. Cumulative periphyton growth and total accumulated sediments were assessed in all enclosures at the end of the experiment. Throughout the experiment, in the controls ammonia and phosphates dropped to near zero, whereas in the mesocosms with L. fortunei they increased two- to tenfold. Nitrates decreased in all mesocosms. In the presence of the mussel, chlorophyll a and algal cells dropped until day 3 increasing thereafter, whereas in the controls they increased from day 0. Periphyton growth and sediment accumulation were significantly higher in the mesocosms with mussels that in the controls. Cell density, proportion of colonial cells and colony size of Microcystis spp. increased in all enclosures, but these increases were dramatically (and very significantly) higher in enclosures with 100 and, especially, with 300 mussels, than in the controls. Our results indicate that L. fortunei modifies nutrient concentrations and proportions, and promotes aggregation of solitary Microcystis spp. cells into colonies; both these effects can favor blooms of this often noxious cyanobacteria.
