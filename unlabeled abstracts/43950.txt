Increased spatial dominance in high nitrogen, saturated soil due to clonal architecture plasticity of the invasive wetland plant, Phalaris arundinacea
Clonality as a plant growth strategy has been a successful adaptation contributing to clonal plants being the dominant vegetation in many ecosystems and has been implicated as a significant factor contributing to invasiveness. The objective of this study was to determine if Phalaris arundinacea, an invasive wetland plant, modifies its clonal growth behavior when grown in high resource conditions. When grown in ideal conditions (high soil-N and moisture), we hypothesized that along with an increase in tiller production and robustness (biomass per tiller), P. arundinacea would increase the spatial spread of tiller placement (distance from parent and daughters). To test this we conducted a greenhouse study in which we grew P. arundinacea seedlings under two soil-N levels (no nitrate addition or 40 g N m-2 year-1) at two soil moisture levels (dry or saturated) for 10 weeks and recorded the placement (angle and distance from the parent plant) of each tiller produced. Total aboveground and belowground biomass, shoot/root ratio, and biomass per tiller were measured at the conclusion of the experiment. Plants grown in saturated conditions produced significantly more tillers that were more widely dispersed. Surprisingly, soil-N did not significantly affect most characteristics of spatial pattern, though soil-N did affect biomass production, shoot/root ratio, and biomass per tiller. These results indicate soil moisture and soil-N affect different aspects of the clonal growth behavior of P. arundinacea in the early stage of colonization. This new information provides a mechanism to explain how P. arundinacea aggressively competes for space in wetland habitats.
