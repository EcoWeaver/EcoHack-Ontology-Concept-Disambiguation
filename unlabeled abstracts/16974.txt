First record of the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774) (Bivalvia, Cyrenidae) in Northern Ireland
Since its first detection on the island of Ireland in April 2010, the invasive Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774) has been confirmed present at five sites within the Republic of Ireland (RoI). In March 2016, specimens of C. fluminea were first discovered in Northern Ireland (NI) within the River Foyle, which delineates the border between RoI and NI. In a subsequent survey in June 2016 an established population was confirmed to be present within the River Foyle, where densities of clams attained 384 individuals m-2. This highly invasive species can potentially represent a significant threat to freshwater environments. Therefore, increased biosecurity awareness and enforcement of existing legislation is needed to prevent further spread.
