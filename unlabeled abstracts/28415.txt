The impact of an invasive weed Tradescantia fluminensis on native forest regeneration
Light availability is clearly important in determining the extent of Tradescantia infestation (Kelly & Skipworth 1984; Maule et al. 1995; this study). The dramatic decrease in the species richness and abundance of native seedlings can be attributed to an increase in Tradescantia biomass and a consequent decrease in light availability. The disparity in seedling abundance and species richness between Tradescantia-affected and non-affected habitats was not explicable by a consistent difference in seed supply either from the seed rain or the seed bank. The differences in seed rain between two Tradescantia plots and the remaining plots at Denton's Bush was driven by species uncommon (i.e. Melicytus ramiflorus and Rhopalostylis sapida) or absent (i.e. Melicytus micranthus) as seedlings. Moreover, the seed rain of the species common as seedlings was greater into Tradescantia compared with non-Tradescantia plots, with the exception of Laurelia novae-zelandiae and Macropiper excelsum at Rangitawa Bush. Alectryon excelsus presents a striking case, for it was the main contributor to seed rain into Tradescantia plots, but seedling recruitment was less than 1% of seed rain. Conversely, Alectryon excelsus ranked 10th in seed rain abundance for non-Tradescantia plots, and seedling recruitment was 33% of seed rain. It is difficult, however, to assess the generality of these results as extreme spatial and temporal heterogeneity typically characterize seed rain and seed bank data (Enright & Cameron 1988; Burrows 1994; Sem & Enright 1996).
