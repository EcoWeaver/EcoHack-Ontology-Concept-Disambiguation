Invasive dreissenid mussels and round gobies: a benthic pathway for the trophic transfer of microcystin.
In this preliminary study, we identify two pathways through which invasive dreissenid mussels can transfer microcystin to higher trophic levels: either directly, through consumption by benthivorous fish such as the round goby; or indirectly, through their biodeposits which are an important food source for benthic invertebrates. Our results suggest that dreissenid mussels represent a potentially important benthic pathway for the food web transfer of microcystin. Environ Toxicol Chem (c) 2013 SETAC.
