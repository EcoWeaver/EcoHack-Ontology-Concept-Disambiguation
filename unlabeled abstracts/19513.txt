Effects of vegetation cutting on the invasive plant Coreopsis lanceolata vary with vegetation type
The invasive plant Coreopsis lanceolata has established itself among various native vegetation types in Japan, but comparative studies of control effects among multiple vegetation types invaded by this plant are few. In the present study, experiments involving vegetation cutting at different frequencies were carried out on three vegetation types: Zoysia japonica dominant type (Zj), C. lanceolata dominant type (Cl) and Miscanthus sinensis dominant type (Ms). Responses of C. lanceolata to changes in cutting frequency varied with vegetation type. In Zj, the abundance of C. lanceolata increased when cutting was performed once or not at all, but tended to decrease when it was performed twice or thrice. In Cl, cutting once increased C. lanceolata, but this species was reduced when other cutting frequencies were employed. In Ms, C. lanceolata increased linearly with cutting frequency. The number of inflorescences of C. lanceolata in the plots was negatively correlated with cutting frequency in Zj and Cl. In Ms, the flowering of C. lanceolata was sometimes observed when cutting was performed only once. The most effective way to suppress C. lanceolata was not necessarily the best way to recover the natives. In Zj, cutting once positively influenced the abundances of native herbs, while cutting thrice or not at all tended to decrease them. In Cl and Ms, cutting thrice reduced the abundances of native herbs, while other cutting frequencies tended to increase them. To control invasive plants and restore the invaded vegetation effectively, the management approach should be changed flexibly in response to vegetation type, and careful monitoring of both invasive and native plants is desirable.
