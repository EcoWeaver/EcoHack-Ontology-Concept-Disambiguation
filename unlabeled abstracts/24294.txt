Reciprocal Relationships Between Exotic Rusty Crayfish, Macrophytes, and Lepomis Species in Northern Wisconsin Lakes
The non-native rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) has invaded many lakes of northern Wisconsin, profoundly changing littoral zones in the process. There are other lakes that have been invaded, but do not exhibit these changes. We hypothesized that endogenous feedbacks could form involving rusty crayfish, the macrophytes they destroy, and Lepomis species whose abundance is positively related to macrophyte abundance and also consume juvenile crayfish. We assessed this proposal with long-term data from one lake, a regional comparative study, and a case study of Lepomis predation on crayfish. Through time and across lakes, abundances of rusty crayfish, littoral macrophytes and species of the genus Lepomis were related in a fashion that indicated a set of feedbacks that regulate the abundance of all three. Intense predation on juvenile crayfish by abundant Lepomis is capable of maintaining some crayfish populations at low abundance. Thus, some lakes display profound ecological changes where crayfish achieve high abundance, and others sustain crayfish at low abundance. Consequently, lakes invaded by rusty crayfish may take on the appearance of alternative ecological regimes. Direct experimentation is necessary to determine if, and under what conditions, a lake can exist in either regime.
