Taxonomic identity of invasive rabbits in Cuba: first record of Eastern Cottontail, Sylvilagus floridanus (Mammalia: Lagomorpha)
In islands of the West Indian zoogeographical region, rabbits are not native, and wild populations are the result of introductions. Oryctolagus cuniculus is the only lagomorph listed among the introduced mammals of the Cuban archipelago. We analyzed specimens of wild rabbits and we report the occurrence of Sylvilagus floridanus for the first time in Cuba. Capture data suggest that their distribution is currently limited to the west-central region of the island. However, the niche models showed high climatic suitability throughout the majority of Cuba, suggesting a high expansion probability.
