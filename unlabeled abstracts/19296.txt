The effect of competition among three salmonids on dominance and growth during the juvenile life stage
Although non-native species can sometimes threaten the value of ecosystem services, their presence can contribute to the benefits derived from the environment. In the Great Lakes, non-native brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) support substantial recreational fisheries. With current efforts underway to restore once-native Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to Lake Ontario, there is some concern that Atlantic salmon will impede non-native contributions to the recreational fishery because Atlantic salmon exhibit niche overlap with brown trout and rainbow trout, particularly during the juvenile life stage. We therefore examined competition and growth of juvenile Atlantic salmon, brown trout and rainbow trout in semi-natural streams. We found that brown trout were the most dominant and had the greatest growth rate regardless of what other species were present. Rainbow trout were more dominant than Atlantic salmon and consumed the most food of the three species. However, in the presence of brown trout, rainbow trout fed less frequently and exhibited negative growth as compared to when the rainbow trout were present with only Atlantic salmon. These data suggest that, outside of density-dependent effects, Atlantic salmon will not impact stream production of brown trout and rainbow trout.
