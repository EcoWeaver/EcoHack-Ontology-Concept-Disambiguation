Alien algae Undaria pinnatifida causes habitat loss for rocky reef fishes in north Patagonia
Since the introduction of Undaria into Nuevo Gulf, Argentina, around 1992, this alien seaweed has now colonized different sites over 700km of coast, forming dense seasonal forests in waters from 0 to 15 meters in depth. In the spring it is common for plants of Undaria to break away from the substrate and be transported by sea currents. As Undaria gets stuck onto reefs it has the potential to reduce habitat quality for reef fish by physically obstructing refuges. This study aims to assess the impact of Undaria on the abundance of four species of rocky-reef fishes by an observational experiment. Fish abundance on reefs with and without Undaria was estimated by underwater visual census methods. Sites were classified according to their topographical relief, as this was expected to influence the effect of Undaria on the abundance of reef fishes. Fish abundance decreased markedly in low-relief reefs that had been covered by Undaria. In contrast, the drifting Undaria had no effect on the abundance of any of the fish species considered in high-relief reefs, where it tends to cover only the lowest-lying areas, leaving much of the refuges for fish unaffected. In conclusion, the presence of Undaria off the coast of Argentina results in transitory habitat loss for reef fishes inhabiting low-relief reefs during late spring and early summer. Although we do not know how much of a threat this habitat loss represents for the conservation of reef fish populations of northern Patagonia, the documented local impact of Undaria within the gulfs is strong and may affect a number of recreational and commercial activities which are centered on the reefs and their fish assemblages.
