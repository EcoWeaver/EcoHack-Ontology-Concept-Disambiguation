Grey squirrels in central Italy: a new threat for endemic red squirrel subspecies
A new population of the invasive American Eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) has recently settled in central Italy from an accidental release in Perugia, Umbria in the early 2000s. The grey squirrel is known to compete with and exclude native red squirrels (S. vulgaris) in the British Isles and Northern Italy, so it represents a potentially important new conservation threat to the red squirrel subspecies of south and central Italy, S. vulgaris italicus and S. v. meridionalis, which are endemic to peninsular Italy. The grey squirrel population range in Perugia is currently expanding at a rate of about 0.29 km/year (SD 0.19), slower than grey squirrel invasions elsewhere in Europe. Nuclear DNA analysed at 12 different microsatellite loci revealed that the grey squirrels in Perugia have extremely low genetic diversity, consistent with a small founder size. Genetic assignment tests indicate that the Perugia population was founded by translocations from an established population in Piedmont, Italy. No genetic substructure is evident yet in the Perugia population. These results together have serious consequences for the management of the grey squirrel invasion in Perugia and the conservation of the red squirrel subspecies: the Perugia grey squirrel population should be eradicated if politically feasible; otherwise new releases of grey squirrels, especially from sources other than the Piedmont population, should be prevented because such introductions could increase genetic diversity, thereby potentially increasing population range expansion rate to the much higher levels seen for more diverse grey squirrel populations elsewhere in Europe.
