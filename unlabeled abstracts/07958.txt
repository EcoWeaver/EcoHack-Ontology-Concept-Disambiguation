The Importance of Tracking Introduced Species: New Records of Athetine Rove Beetles from South Atlantic Inaccessible Island (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae, Aleocharinae)
Two species of athetine rove beetles are recorded from Inaccessible Island, in the Tristan da Cunha group of islands in the South Atlantic for the first time. One species, Halobrecta flavipes Thomson, represents a new introduction possibly from the Palearctic region, and the other species, Atheta (Xenota) pseudoinsulana Klimaszewski, new species, is of an undetermined origin. The latter belongs to the Laticollis group of species that are broadly distributed and are known to occur in the Palearctic, Nearctic, Afrotropical, and Oriental regions as well as some Atlantic Islands. The lectotype is designated for Homalota dilutipennis Motschulsky [= Atheta dilutipennis (Motschulsky)].
