Prevalence of Salmonella in green anoles (Anolis Carolinensis), an invasive alien species in Naha and Tomishiro Cities, Okinawa Main Island, Japan
Here, we investigated the prevalence of Salmonellaenterica, with and without resistance to 17 common antimicrobial agents, in 706 green anoles (Anolis carolinensis) that were collected in Naha and Tomishiro Cities, Okinawa Main Island, Japan, between 2009 and 2014. Salmonella strains, including S. enterica Weltevreden and Enteritidis serovars, were identified in the large intestinal content samples extracted from 15 (2.1%) of the analyzed green anoles. No antimicrobial resistance was detected. Thus, the present study demonstrates that although the prevalence of Salmonella and the risk of its transmission from the green anoles to humans or other animals on Okinawa Main Island are relatively low, the green anole population nevertheless represents a potential source of Salmonella infection that could affect human health in this region.
