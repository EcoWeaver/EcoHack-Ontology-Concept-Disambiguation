Growth of blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, in the Yumurtalik Cove, Turkey: a molt process approach
Abstract The blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) is native to the western Atlantic, but is an invasive species in the Mediterranean. This study examined the dynamics of growth in an invasive population of blue crab in the Yumurtalik Cove, Turkey (North Eastern Mediterranean). Growth was quantified using a discontinuous growth model, a molt process model. Crab growth histories were observed for individual crabs held in field enclosures in summer 2010 and 2011. Carapace widths ranged from 14.13 to 80.07 mm. A mean growth per molt of 120.6% increase in carapace width was observed. Chronological inter-molt periods ranging between 3 days and 67 days were observed. The average IMP was 16 days in Yumurtalik Cove. The mean physiological IMP was 270+-163 degree-days, ranging from 72-781 degree-days.
