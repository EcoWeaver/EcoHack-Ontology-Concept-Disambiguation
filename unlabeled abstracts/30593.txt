Age and growth of invasive round goby Neogobius melanostomus from middle Danube
Age and growth of the invasive population of round goby Neogobius melanostomus from the Slovak stretch of River Danube was examined. The samples (n=1130) were collected soon after the invasion was recorded (2004-2005), and later, when the population was already established (2008-2010). Invasive round goby in newly-occupied areas were found to reach smaller body size (15-153 mm standard length) compared to native populations. Age from 0+ to 4+, determined from scales, was recorded in both sexes. Annulus formed in April-May, which varied with age. Growth of freshly established gobies was negative allometric, suggesting increased allocation of their sources to reproduction, which corresponds to less specialized life-history. However, positive allometric growth found in longer established individuals suggests a shift in allocation towards somatic growth, which corresponds to more specialized life-history typical for native populations. None of the three parameters predicted by the theory of alternative ontogenies and invasive potential met the expectations, though two parameters, i.e. growth rate and age at maturation remain equivocal. This can be explained by too short of a time span that has elapsed from the beginning of invasion, or by ecological disturbances that have broken up otherwise stable environment in the habitat studied.
