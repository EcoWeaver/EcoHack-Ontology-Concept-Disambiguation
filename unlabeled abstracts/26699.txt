LONG-TERM CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF INTERTIDAL ASSEMBLAGES AFTER INVASION BY SARGASSUM MUTICUM (PHAEOPHYTA)1
The macroalgal assemblages at the low intertidal zone were studied at three localities on the north coast of Spain between 1977 and 2002. Two of these localities were invaded at the end of the 1980s by the brown seaweed Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt (Phaeophyta, Sargassaceae), whereas the third locality remained free of the invader. In 2002, distinct algal assemblages were noticed in invaded and noninvaded localities. No major changes were detected in the noninvaded locality. Apart from the obvious presence of S. muticum, the changes observed in the invaded localities included a significant reduction in abundance of the previous dominant species (the red alga Gelidium spinosum (S. G. Gmelin) P. C. Silva) as well as an increased number of species and diversity, increased primary productivity, and variations in the seasonal abundance patterns of some species. We speculate that the arrival of S. muticum had a negative effect on the dominant native G. spinosum, probably related to competition for light. This resulted in indirect positive effects on other species of the assemblage (such as Bifurcaria bifurcata R. Ross). Other small epiphytic opportunistic species might also have been benefited from the presence of S. muticum, because the invader has a rich associated epiphytic assemblage.
