Alien fish and crayfish species in Hellenic freshwaters and aquaculture
The diversity of ichthyofauna in the Hellenic freshwaters is highlighted by the presence of 161 species. This actually represents 27.8% of the total fish species recorded in the European freshwaters, including both native and introduced, suggesting that Greece represents a 'hot spot' for biodiversity. The introduction of alien species for restocking, aquarium trade and aquaculture was responsible for deliberate or accidental releases of alien specimens in the open waters and in some cases for establishing populations. On the other hand, commercially valuable alien species (for example salmonids, cyprinids and lately sturgeons) generated significant income to individuals, companies and to the national economy. The current work aims to review the situation regarding the presence of alien fish and crayfish species in the Hellenic freshwaters and particularly in aquaculture and to stress out issues concerning their aquaculture potential.
