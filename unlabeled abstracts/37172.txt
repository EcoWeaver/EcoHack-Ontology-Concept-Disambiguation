Watersnakes Prey on Invasive Fishes in an Urban Canal in Southern Florida
Canals in southern Florida are populated by a variety of invasive fish species, but interactions between these invasive fishes and native species are poorly understood. Watersnakes are documented predators of fishes and are well studied in many portions of their range; however, few studies have addressed their ecology and life history in the expansive southern Florida canal system. I captured individuals of 2 watersnake species in a canal in a residential southern Florida neighborhood to determine which fish species were preyed upon. I recovered 4 prey items, all of which were invasive fishes.
