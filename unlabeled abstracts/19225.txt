Alien invasive neophytes of the Southeastern part of the Pannonian Plain
Abstract Floristic diversity in the Pannonian Plain is the result of mosaic habitat composition, characterized by steppes, saline meadows, and lowland forests along major rivers. In the last few centuries, the flora has become enriched by species introduced by human activities, such as colonization and industrialization. Presently it consists of nearly 1800 species. As a result of 30 years of field research as well as herbarium and literature searches, a list of invasive alien neophytes has been compiled and is presented here. The list includes 152 species, classified as either naturalized, casual, or unknown. One of the species is listed in Red Book of Serbian Flora. Eighty species are naturalized, and 61 are casual species. The majority of the introduced flora originates from North America (66) and the Old World (43). Most alien invasive species of the Southeastern part of the Pannonian Plain, were introduced accidentally by seed material or deliberately by nursery saplings. The annual and perennial herbaceous plants, which flower in the summer and summer-autumn periods, are represented in the greatest numbers. The alien flora was further analyzed with respect to taxonomy, life forms, pollination, and seed dispersal mode. The greatest number of alien species appears in anthropogenic and semi-natural habitats (59). In natural habitats, 45 invasive taxa were recorded, representing a conservation threat to biodiversity.
