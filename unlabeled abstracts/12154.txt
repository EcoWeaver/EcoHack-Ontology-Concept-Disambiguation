Exploitation spider predators in corn in biological control of invasive species Diabrotica virgifera LC (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)
Population level from the adults of Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (1868), a serious pest of corn, may be reduced by exploitation of predator spiders existing in corn crops. About 20 years after their introduction in Romania, acreage treated for adults of this pest was substantially reduced by using different non-chemical methods. One of these methods is classical biological method using natural enemies, especially predator spiders. Few studies have tackled in this direction, in many cases without success. In our study, developed over two years (2014, 2015), we considered abundant species of spiders predators in the west of the country (Timis county). Researches were held both in the natural life of spiders and laboratory, in 4 cages and 4 terrariums specially arranged. They were seen preying only spiders who weave cloth (Araneae: Argiopinae, Araneidae, Theridiidae) and those who are hiding in the silks of directly attacking prey (Thomisidae). Thus were revealed following species: Argiope bruennichi S., Araneus diadematus C., Xysticus kochi T., Xysticus cristatus C. and Theridion cinereum T. The most aggressive proved to be spiders of the genus Argiope and Xysticus who consumed between 6.8 and 7.5 Diabrotica beetles, weekly, in their living habitat. No beetles have been consumed by spiders in the laboratory. Future, consideration of the protection and exploitation of crop predator spiders can be a way to reduce polluting methods using in pest control.
