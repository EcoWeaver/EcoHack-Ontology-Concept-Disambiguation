Invasive Plant Species of the Wide Area of the Town of Lukavac as a Threat to Biodiversity
Invasive plant species are foreign species that usually have a negative impact to the native flora and vegetation, human health, or that cause damage to agriculture and the economy. Therefore, the spread of invasive species is one of the biggest problems in nature protection. The aim of the work is to determine the invasive plant species in the wider area of the city of Lukavac, to analyze the life forms and the geographical origin. The research was done during the summer months of 2021. This paper presents the results of research on invasive plant species in the wider area of the town of Lukavac, which is located in the northeastern part of Bosnia and Herzegovina and administratively belongs to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Tuzla Canton. Total 12 invasive species from 8 families and 12 genera were recorded. The largest number of species belongs to the Asteraceae family, while the other families are represented by one species. Among life forms, therophytes (58, 33%) and phanerophytes (25%) dominate. Geophytes and hemicryptophytes are represented by only one plant species. Recorded invasive plant species come from North America (75%) and Asia (25%).
