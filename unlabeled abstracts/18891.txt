Development of microsatellite markers for the yellow-legged Asian hornet, Vespa velutina, a major threat for European bees
We report the characterization of fifteen microsatellite markers in Vespa velutina, an invasive hornet from Asia that has been unintentionally introduced in France before 2005. It is expanding rapidly, covering one third of the French territory and northern Spain, and causes severe losses to honeybee colonies. An enrichment protocol was used to isolate microsatellite loci, and polymorphism was explored in an invasive population from France and in a population from the native mainland location in China. These markers showed a number of alleles per locus and per population ranging from 1 to 11, and expected heterozygosities ranging from 0.151 to 0.891. These polymorphic markers will be useful to identify the source of the invading population and to discover the invasion pathways.
