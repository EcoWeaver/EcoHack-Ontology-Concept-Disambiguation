Assessing the residual effects of Carpobrotus edulis invasion, implications for restoration
We examined whether the residual effects on soil caused by the invasion of Carpobrotus edulis, common iceplant, would inhibit the reestablishment of a native plant species. Carpobrotus edulis interacts both directly by suppressing the growth and establishment of other plants and indirectly by altering soil chemistry. We tested whether the residual effects of C. edulis resulted in lowered germination, survival, growth, and reproduction of Gilia millefoliata, a rare dune annual. We compared G. millefoliata planted in plots previously occupied by C. edulis to G. millefoliata planted in plots that previously had native vegetation. Each plot received three treatments: seed, transplant, and unplanted, and were censused every three weeks until senescence. Carpobrotus edulis had strong negative effects on the germination, survival, growth, and reproduction of G. millefoliata. C. edulis lowers soil pH and increases organic content due to the recalcitrance of tissue to decomposition, which may have evolved as a mechanism to facilitate recolonization and invasion.
