The Potential Role of Stream Habitat Restoration in Facilitating Salmonid Invasions: A Habitat-Hydraulic Modeling Approach
Many successful invasions have taken place in systems where harmful disturbance has changed habitat conditions. However, less attention has been paid to the role of habitat restoration, which modifies habitats and thus also has the potential to facilitate invasions. We examined whether in-stream habitat restorations have the potential to either facilitate or resist invasion by two widely introduced non-native stream salmonids, Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchill and Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, in Finland. A physical habitat simulation system was used to calculate whether the habitat area for the target species increased or decreased following the restorations. For comparison, we also reported results for four native stream fish species. The simulations showed that the restored streams provided the highest amount of usable habitat area for the native species, particularly for Salmo salar L. and Gottus gobio L. However, it was interesting to note that the restorations significantly increased habitat quality for the two non-native species, especially at low flows. Nevertheless, the non-native species had the lowest amount of usable habitat area overall. The modeling results indicated that not only habitat destruction but also habitat restoration could contribute to the spread of non-native species. Fisheries and wildlife managers should be aware of the possibility, when restoring habitats in order to preserve native ecosystems, that non-native species could manage to gain a foothold in restored habitats and use them as population sources for further spread. Knowing the widespread negative effect of non-native species, this risk should not be underestimated.
