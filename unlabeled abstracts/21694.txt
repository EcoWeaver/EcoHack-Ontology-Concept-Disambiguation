A New elm Leafmining Sawfly (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) from Russia
Fenusa absens, n. sp., is described from Novosibirsk, Russia. It was reared from leaf mines in Siberian elm, Ulmus pumila L. Placement of this species in Fenusa Leach is discussed, and comparison is made to other species of elm leafmining sawflies. Because Ulmus pumila is not native to the Novosibirsk region, it is possible that Fenusa absens is an introduced species in the area.
