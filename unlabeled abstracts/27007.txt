Establishment of self-sustaining populations of non-native fish species in the River Trent and Warwickshire Avon, UK, indicated by the presence of 0+ fish
This study investigated the reproduction of non-native fish species, inferred from the presence of 0+ fish, in three English lowland rivers over an 8 year period. Evidence of self-sustaining populations was found for three non-native fish species, namely zander Sander lucioperca (in the River Trent and Warwickshire Avon), bitterling Rhodeus amarus (in the Trent) and carp Cyprinus carpio (in the Trent and Avon). Notwithstanding, such fishes are currently rare, accounting for <1% of the 0+ fish communities of these two rivers, and no non-native species were recorded from the Yorkshire Ouse. It is possible, however, that improvements in water quality and habitat, together with the potential effects of climate change, may facilitate consolidation and expansion of their populations, as well as those of other non-native fish species already present or introduced in the future. This could have repercussions for the ecology and management of non-native fishes in the UK.
