The known unknowns--managing the invasion risk from biofuels
Research highlights > While biofuel crops may help solve our energy crisis, they pose a risk for our natural and agricultural ecosystems. > Successful high impact invasions are low probability, but high impact, irreversible events. > The past 15 years has seen the emergence of tools and frameworks for the assessment of plants for potential weediness. > These tools achieve impressive accuracy, seemingly in the face of ecological theory. > There is a number of measures that will help to manage the invasion risk of biofuels plants.
