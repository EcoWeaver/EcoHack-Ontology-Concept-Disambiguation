Bioinvasion in Antarctic Ecosystems
Antarctic ecosystems are considered to be pristine ecosystems; however, increasing global temperature and a considerable increase in human activities pertaining to scientific investigations and tourism are major issues that need an immediate address by global scientific communities. This review encompasses around the present and future threats to Antarctic ecosystems due to bioinvasion highlighting the conservation value of native Antarctic species vis-a-vis the impacts of invasive species on native organisms. The initiatives for prevention of bio-invasion in Antarctic ecosystems have also been summarised.
