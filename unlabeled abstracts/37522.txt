Pine invasion decreases density and changes native tree communities in woodland Cerrado
Background: Invasive plants can negatively impact native communities, but the majority of the effects of these invasions have been demonstrated only for temperate ecosystems. Tropical ecosystems, including the Cerrado, a biodiversity hotspot, are known to be invaded by numerous non-native species, but studies of their impacts are largely lacking. Aims: Our research aimed at quantifying how Pinus spp. presence and density affected Cerrado plant communities. Methods: We sampled areas invaded and non-invaded by Pinus spp. to determine if pine invasion affected native tree richness, diversity, evenness, and density. We also evaluated if community composition differed between invaded and non-invaded sites. Results: We found invaded plots had lower native tree densities than non-invaded plots and that Pinus spp. invasions changed native tree communities by reducing native species abundances. Conclusion: Invasive pines had negative impacts on the native Cerrado tree community by reducing native plant density and changing species abundances. Reduced density and abundance at early invasion stages can result in reduction in biodiversity in the long term.
