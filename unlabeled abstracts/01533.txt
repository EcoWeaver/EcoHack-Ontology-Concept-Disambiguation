Chemical Warfare Among Invaders: A Detoxification Interaction Facilitates an Ant Invasion
Know Your Enemy Fire ants accidentally introduced to North America from their native range in Argentina have been hugely invasive and difficult to eradicate and caused both environmental and economic damage. Recently, another accidentally introduced Argentine ant, the tawny crazy ant, appears to be displacing the fire ants. How? LeBrun et al. (p. 1014 , published online 13 February; see the Perspective by Kaspari and Weiser ) show that tawny crazy ants have a chemical and behavioral response to the toxic bite of fire ants that vastly reduces their mortality during confrontations and that allows the tawny crazy ants to outcompete their rivals.
