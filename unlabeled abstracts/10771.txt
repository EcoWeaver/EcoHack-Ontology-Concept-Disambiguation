Biological invasions of nature reserves: A search for generalisations
Each one of the 24 nature reserves in the preceding case studies has received introduced species of plants and vertebrates (and invertebrates where the data exist). Some of these have become invasive, although the probability that an island nature reserve is invaded is greater than a savanna or dry woodland. Arid lands and Mediterranean-type reserves showed a negative relationship between the proportion of species that are introduced and the reserve's area. Examples demonstrate that after a period of about 1000 years it is difficult to distinguish between native and introduced species.Invasive species affect both the structure and function of an ecosystem. Management priority has to be given both to invasive species that threaten endemic species with extinction and to species that have a strong landscape effect. The cost of controlling invasive species can utilise a large proportion of a reserve manager's recurrent budget. Tourism poses dangers for reserves since there is a positive correlation between visitation rate and the number of introduced species.The most important generalisation is that all nature reserves, except those in Antarctica, appear to have invasive species. Managers face the problem of how best to conserve ecological variety.
