Invasion of mesic mountain fynbos by Pinus radiata
Pinus radiata, an important plantation species in South Africa, also invades mountain fynbos in the S and SW Cape Province and is a threat to the conservation of this vegetation type. Invasion began almost immediately after the first release of seeds from an adjacent plantation. Initial colonizers established at distances of up to 3 km from the seed source. Populations increased rapidly after a fire and resultant stands were dominated by cohorts that established during the immediate post-fire phase. Where fire had been excluded, population growth was slower and less dense, uneven-aged stands resulted. -from Authors
