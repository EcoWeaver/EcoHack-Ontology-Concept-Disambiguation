Population structure, condition, and reproduction characteristics of native monkey goby, Neogobius fluviatilis (Actinopterygii: Perciformes Gobiidae), in the Bulgarian Danube
The monkey goby Neogobius fluviatilis (Pallas, 1814) is a moderately large goby (up to 195 mm total length) with a short life span of 5-6 years, reaching sexual matu-rity in its second-or third year of life (Placha et al. 2010). Males exhibit territorial nesting behaviour and parental care (Grabowska 2005, Grabowska et al. 2009). The length of spawning season varies from just two months (March-April) in Turkey (Sasi and Berber 2010) to very protracted spawning (April to August) in the Volga and Danube deltas (Pinchuk et al. 2003). The monkey goby is natively distributed throughout the Ponto-Caspian region (Neilson and Stepien 2011), inhabit-ing both inland freshwater habitats and saline waters. Their range expansion from a formerly static natural distribution was first observed during the 1960s (Banarescu 1970), and quite recently this fish reached the Slovakian section of the Danube River (Polacik et al. 2008). In 2008, the presence of monkey goby was confirmed on the German Rhine at the port of Duisburg (Stemmer 2008), and in 2009 in the Dutch Rhine (van Kessel et al. 2009), probably having migrated downstream. As there has been no published record of monkey goby between Austria and the German upper Rhine (joined by the Rhine-Main-Danube canal), the occurrence at Duisburg almost certainly represents an introduction via shipping, either in ballast water or sand/gravel as cargo. The species has also extended its range through the second invasion pathway i.e., the Dnieper-Pripyat-Bug-Vistula river system (Neilson and Stepien 2011), causing the expansion of this species into Poland (Kostrzewa et al. 2004, Grabowska et al. 2009). Comparison of native and non-native invasive popula-tions can provide better insights into the biological or environmental factors that contribute to range extension in such species (Neilson and Stepien 2011).
