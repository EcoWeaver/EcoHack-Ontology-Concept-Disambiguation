New data on an exotic Nippotaenia mogurndae (Cestoda), newly introduced to Europe
Abstract Data on prevalence and current distribution of the cestode Nippotaenia mogurndae Yamaguti and Miyata, 1940 (Nippotaeniidea) in Slovakia, are provided. A total of 163 fish from 8 localities of different types in the Tisa River basin were infected with N. mogurndae. The mean intensity of infection was 1.8 with a maximum of 5 tapeworms. The expansion of the distribution of the cestode corresponds well with the spreading of its host, the invasive fish Amur sleeper Perccottus glenii Dybowski, 1877. The Spearmann correlation coefficient was used to test the relationship between the intensity of infection and standard length of the fish (r = 0.36; n = 163; P < 0.05), condition coefficient of the fish (r = 0.22; n = 115; P < 0.05) and season (r = -0.37; n = 355; P < 0.05). A significant correlation was confirmed for each pair of variables. There is a statistically significant difference between the prevalence of the cestode in two functional size groups (t = 3.28; n = 163; P < 0.05). The prevalence of the cestode increased with the standard length of fish. The potential risk of further expansion of N. mogurndae to other countries is discussed.
