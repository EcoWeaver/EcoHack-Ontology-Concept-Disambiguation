Identification of the Copepod Intermediate Host of the Introduced Broad Fish Tapeworm, Diphyllobothrium latum, in Southern Chile
The broad fish tapeworm, Diphyllobothrium latum, is an exotic species in both Chile and Argentina, and until now, its copepod host has remained unknown in South American waters. The objective of this study was to identify calanoid copepod species that may be intermediate hosts for D. latum in Lake Panguipulli, Chile. In this lake, the highest levels of infection by this tapeworm occur in the introduced rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Of the 2 calanoid copepods found in Lake Panguipulli, Diaptomus diabolicus and Boeckella gracilipes, only D. diabolicus became infected on experimental exposure to coracidia. Prevalence (mean intensity) of experimental infection in adult copepods was 73.2% (2.8 procercoids per host). Diaptomus diabolicus has been demonstrated to be a new intermediate host; this is the first record of a copepod host for D. latum in South America.
