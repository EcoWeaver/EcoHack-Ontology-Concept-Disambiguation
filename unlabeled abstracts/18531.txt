Alien invertebrates transported accidentally to the Polish Antarctic Station in cargo and on fresh foods
AbstractDuring three austral summer seasons cargo, expeditioner clothes and equipment of the Polish Antarctic Expedition were examined for the presence of alien propagules. De- tailed inspections were undertaken at the station buildings, searching for any invertebrates. During each austral summer fresh fruits and vegetables were also inspected. A total of 359 invertebrates and their remains were found in cargo transported to Arctowski Station, or caught in the station's facilities. The majority of samples were classified as cultivation pests (26%), food pests (43%), wood-destroying pests (4%), domestic insects and arachnids (15%). Through supply of the research station a wide range of alien organisms can be acci- dentally transported and ultimately introduced to the Antarctic. This study has clearly dem- onstrated that almost all cargo items can be a potential vector for alien organisms. Species from a broad range of biological groups can be transported to the Antarctic and remain in a viable state.
