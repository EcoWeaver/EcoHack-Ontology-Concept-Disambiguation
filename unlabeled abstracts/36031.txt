Impacts of the invasive species Caulerpa cylindracea Sonder, 1845 on the algae flora of the west coast of Algeria
The assessment of the impacts of the expansion of the invasive species on taxonomic diversity, the abundance and dominance of groups of algae, the presence and/or absence of species of ecological interest that may or may not be indicative of water quality well mentioned, through the installation of a 20 x 20 cm quadrat representing the minimum area. The observation stations were visited monthly, during a repetitive three-year cycle, during the spring, summer and autumn seasons, periods of maximum growth and development of the algal flora and the results suggest the following facts. The invasive alga Caulerpa cylindracea Sonder, 1845 tends to colonise disturbed ecosystems reflecting a reduction in native algal diversity; in fact, we note a drastic impoverishment of the invaded algal community, represented by a limited number of Macrophyte algae accompanying the invasive taxon in phytosociological surveys and a Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index (H') and Equitability reduced by 4.49 and 0.77 n the heavily affected station. The number of macroalgal species accompanying the invasive species has dropped by 52% in Salamandre. In addition, the multidimensional analysis, represented by the Hierarchical Ascendant Clustering applied to this case, confirms our results.
