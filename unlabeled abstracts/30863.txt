Speciation: Founder Events and Their Effects on X-Linked and Autosomal Genes
We analyze the role that random genetic drift and founder events might play in speciation and the evolution of reproductive isolation by examining the relative probabilities that X-linked and autosomal genes affecting reproductive isolation will be involved in a drift-mediated peak shift. X chromosomes are more likely than autosomes to be affected by drift. However, the smaller effective population size and increased drift variance of X-linked genes are exactly offset by their lower, within-population, equilibrium genetic variance at mutation-selection balance. Thus, the among-deme variance of X-linked genes is equivalent to that of autosomal genes. However, the third and higher moments of the distribution of gene frequencies among populations do differentially affect the relative probabilities of peak shifts by founder event processes, such that traits controlled by a single additive X-linked gene are more likely to shift than with a similar autosomal gene. Genes affecting only one sex are more likely to undergo peak shifts than genes affecting both sexes because of higher gene frequencies at mutation-selection balance. Sex specificity may make genes affecting fertility more likely to undergo peak shifts than genes affecting viability. We conclude that the hypothesis of speciation by drift-mediated peak shifts requires special assumptions concerning the genetic conditions that obtain before as opposed to after a founder event and depend on the nature of genetic variation for reproductive isolation.
