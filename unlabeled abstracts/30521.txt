Current distribution of invasive feral pigs in Brazil: economic impacts and ecological uncertainty
Invasion of feral pigs worldwide is a concern to both biodiversity and human well being. Its harmful effects on ecosystems require control or eradication plans. In Brazil, there were three waves of invasions, and in the past 20 years, we watched an unprecedented invasion of feral pigs. They were progressively released to the wild after the commercial appeal around exotic pig business proved to be unprofitable. Here we present an up to date map of the distribution of feral pig in Brazil, revealing the magnitude of invasion. Federal plan to control feral pig populations arise in different occasions along last 20 years, and the most recent one (IN 03/2013) was in fact intended to protect macro-economic interests, rather than biodiversity or local economies. Relying in the action of hunters to protect biodiversity from the noxious species, the new control policy presents challenges and opportunities to be considered by decision makers.
