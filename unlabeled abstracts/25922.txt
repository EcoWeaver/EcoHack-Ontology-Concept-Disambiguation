Population genetics of the invasive water weed Elodea canadensis in Finnish waterways
Invasions of exotic species often involve a rapid evolutionary change in the introduced populations. Elodea canadensis is an invasive aquatic weed native to North America. Our aims were to reveal the evolutionary consequences of invasion to the population genetic structure of the presumably clonal E. canadensis in Finland and to test the hypothesis that the whole Finnish population originates from the first introduction of the species. We used ten polymorphic microsatellite markers to analyze the genetic characteristics of seven introduced E. canadensis populations in Finland. Despite the species' totally asexual mode of reproduction in Finland, two to five alleles per locus were detected in Finnish populations, and the expected heterozygosities varied between 0.19 and 0.37. The majority of variation was found within populations. Except for one, all pairwise values of population differentiation (F ST) were significant, indicating restricted gene flow among the Finnish populations. In addition, a Bayesian analysis of population structure revealed the presence of regional population structuring. Genetic analyses indicate that E. canadensis could have been introduced to Finland multiple times. However, the amount of genetic variation and regional clustering detected could also be explained by post-establishment evolution, and based on this study it is not possible to exclude one introduction event followed by rapid evolution. We also tested the usability of the microsatellite markers for native North American samples in order to compare the within-population genetic characteristics of introduced and native populations. However, in native populations only four microsatellite markers amplified reliably, indicating sequence variation within primer-binding regions and, thus, genetic differentiation among populations of E. canadensis.
