A novel nudivirus infecting the invasive demon shrimp Dikerogammarus haemobaphes (Amphipoda)
The Nudiviridae are a family of large double-stranded DNA viruses that infect the cells of the gut in invertebrates, including insects and crustaceans. The phylogenetic range of the family has recently been enhanced via the description of viruses infecting penaeid shrimp, crangonid shrimp, homarid lobsters and portunid crabs. Here we extend this by presenting the genome of another nudivirus infecting the amphipod Dikerogammarus haemobaphes. The virus, which infects cells of the host hepatopancreas, has a circular genome of 119,754 bp in length, and encodes a predicted 106 open reading frames. This novel virus encodes all the conserved nudiviral genes (sharing 57 gene homologues with other crustacean-infecting nudiviruses) but appears to lack the p6.9 gene. phylogenetic analysis revealed that this virus branches before the other crustacean-infecting nudiviruses and shares low levels of gene/protein similarity to the Gammanudivirus genus. Comparison of gene synteny from known crustacean-infecting nudiviruses reveals conservation between Homarus gammarus nudivirus and Penaeus monodon nudivirus; however, three genomic rearrangements in this novel amphipod virus appear to break the gene synteny between this and the ones infecting lobsters and penaeid shrimp. We explore the evolutionary history and systematics of this novel virus, suggesting that it be included in the novel Epsilonnudivirus genus (Nudiviridae).
