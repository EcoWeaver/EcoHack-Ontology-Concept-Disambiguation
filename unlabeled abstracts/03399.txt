Interspecific larval competition between invasive Aedes japonicus and native Aedes triseriatus (Diptera: Culicidae) and adult longevity
The Asian rock pool mosquito Aedes japonicus (Theobald) inhabits natural and artificial container habitats, some of which are occupied by the native treehole mosquitoAedes triseriatus (Say), a vector of LaCrosse encephalitis virus. A laboratory experiment was used to evaluate the effects of nutrient limitation and interspecific interactions between these species. The goal was to address two related hypotheses. First, interspecific interactions between these species show competitive asymmetry with the invasive mosquito Ae. japonicus being favored over Ae. triseriatus. Second, competitive stress at the larval stage alters adult longevity. There was minimal evidence for competitive asymmetry between these two species. Mosquito and population performance showed clear negative density-dependent effects with similar effects of intra- and interspecific interactions. Only Ae. japonicus development time showed competitive asymmetry over Ae. triseriatus, providing weak support for the first hypothesis. For both species, competition resulted in lower adult longevity compared with low competition, providing support for the second hypothesis. These results suggest both species are similarly affected by intra- and interspecific competition and underscore the importance of the effects of larval competition that continue into adulthood and alter parameters important to transmission of vector-borne diseases.
