Neophytes in Pannonian hardwood floodplain forests - History, present situation and trends
Invasions of neophyte plant species are considered as one of the major threats to the diversity of natural ecosystems including floodplain forests. Pressure from human activities has increased rapidly during last few decades, therefore we suppose that the penetration of neophytes into forest habitats is greater nowadays than it was in the past. The aims of our study were: to find out if there is a significant increase in the number of neophyte species and their cover in the hardwood floodplain forests in the Pannonian region over time; to compare the occurrence of neophytes in Slovak and Hungarian datasets in different periods; and to explain the relationship between ecological factors and species richness of native vegetation, and the level of invasion of hardwood floodplain forests.
