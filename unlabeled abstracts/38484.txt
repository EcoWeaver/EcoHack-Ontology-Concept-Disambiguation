Does lake eutrophication support biological invasions in rivers? A study on Dreissena polymorpha (Bivalvia) in lake-river ecotones
The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) has all traits required to effectively colonize the aquatic environment and consequently reduce the diversity of native bivalves. We hypothesized that the zebra mussel chooses lake outlets characterized by medium current velocity and good food conditions. Here, we analyzed differences between bivalve abundances in lake outlets with varying environmental conditions such as the Carlson Index (trophy status), depth, width, current velocity, bed vegetation coverage, and type of bottom substrate. The results showed that the zebra mussel inhabits outlets that provide food (high trophy outlets) and have a mineral bed and a medium current velocity (ca. 0.2-0.3 m/s). The following main factors seem to be favorable for colonizing such outlets: (1) easy access to high amounts of food due to the increased density of the suspension drifting from the lake and (2) easy transport of the zebra mussel larvae from the lake to the downstream. The zebra mussel larvae drifting with the current may colonize the downstream. An increase in lake trophy may indirectly cause an increase in biological invasions in rivers. Zebra mussel is worldwide invasive species which ecology in the river-lake ecotone is unknown. Dreissenids were more numerous in the outlets from highly eutrophicated lakes, and the mineral bottom and high water current velocity support the colonization. Lake pollution may positively affect the zebra mussel colonization in rivers.
