Assessing the Impact of Invasive Species Management Strategies on the Population Dynamics of Castor bean (Ricinus communisL., Euphorbiaceae) at Two Southern California Coastal Habitats
The diverse uses of Ricinus communis L. (Castor bean) in herbalism, agriculture, and horticulture have facilitated the worldwide dispersal of this invasive r-selected species. A common element in ruderal areas and transitional habitats, the invasive species management of R. communis in southern California has largely relied on manual removal strategies. This study evaluates how the survivorship and fecundity of naturalized R. communis populations is impacted by the invasive species management strategies at two sites: Ballona Wetlands and Temescal Canyon Gateway Park. Our findings suggest that documenting patterns of survival and reproduction serve as a tool for the adaptive management of invasive species control strategies.
