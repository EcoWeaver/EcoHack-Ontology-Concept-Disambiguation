Optimizing early detection of non-indigenous species: estimating the scale of dispersal of a nascent population of the invasive tunicate Ciona intestinalis (L.).
Knowledge of dispersal and establishment during the early stages of invasion is essential for allocating monitoring effort, detecting nascent populations and predicting spread. The scarcity of these data, however, provides little guidance for monitoring programs. Here we present data on the adult distribution and the subsequent pattern of larval recruitment from a nascent population of the invasive tunicate Ciona intestinalis in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Existing niche models indicate the entire study site is suitable for recruitment, suggesting an equal probability of detection throughout the site. In contrast, we found a heterogeneous pattern of larval recruitment, including areas of zero recruitment. By fitting a dispersal kernel, we show Ciona is not capable of naturally dispersing between bays, restricting further spread, and provide guidance for future monitoring. Our results also highlight how large-scale models, although important, lack the small-scale patterns essential for monitoring and early detection of invasive species.
