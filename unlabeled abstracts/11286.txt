Success factors and future prospects of Ponto-Caspian peracarid (Crustacea: Malacostraca) invasions: Is 'the worst over'?
Ponto-Caspian peracarids (amphipods, isopods, mysids and cumaceans) represent one of the most successful groups of aquatic invaders comprising several high-impact species, such as Chelicorophium curvispinum, Dikerogammarus villosus, or Hemimysis anomala. In the present study we made the first attempt to compare biological traits and the environmental preferences of invasive and non-invasive members of the group based on both literature and field data (Joint Danube Survey 3, 2013) with the goal of identifying factors linked to invasion success and drawing conclusions on future invasion risks. Both datasets indicated substrate preference as an important factor in spontaneous range expansion; all invasive species are lithophilous, whereas the majority of non-invasives are psammo-pelophilous. The remaining seven presently non-invasive lithophilous species deserve special attention when considering potential future invaders; however, due to their rarity and possible negative interactions with earlier colonists we consider the probability of their expansion in the foreseeable future as low. Their potential expansion could most likely be of minor consequence anyway, since no considerable functional novelty can be attributed to them in addition to species already present. In this limited context (regarding habitats dominated by hard substrates and not considering the potential further spread of already invasive species) it might be justified to conclude that 'the worst is over'. Nevertheless, impending navigation development projects both in the Danube-Main-Rhine and Dnieper-Pripyat-Bug-Vistula systems might favour the future spread of non-lithophilous species, which might imply a new invasion wave of Ponto-Caspian peracarids.
