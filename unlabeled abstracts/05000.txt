Competition and soil resource environment alter plant-soil feedbacks for native and exotic grasses.
Feedbacks between plants and soil biota are increasingly identified as key determinants of species abundance patterns within plant communities. However, our understanding of how plant-soil feedbacks may contribute to invasions is limited by our understanding of how feedbacks may shift in the light of other ecological processes. Here we assess how the strength of plant-soil feedbacks may shift as soil microbial communities change along a gradient of soil Nitrogen (N) availability and how these dynamics may be further altered by the presence of a competitor. We conducted a greenhouse experiment where we grew native Stipa pulchra and exotic Avena fatua, alone and in competition, in soils inoculated with conspecific and heterospecific soil microbial communities conditioned in low, ambient, and high N environments. Stipa pulchra decreased in heterospecific soil and in the presence of a competitor, while the exotic Avena fatua's performance shifted with soil microbial communities from altered N environments. Morever, competition and soil microbial communities from high N environment eliminated Stipa's positive plant-soil feedbacks. Our results highlight the importance of examining how individual plant-soil feedbacks may interact in a broader community context and contribute to the establishment, spread, and dominance of invaders.
