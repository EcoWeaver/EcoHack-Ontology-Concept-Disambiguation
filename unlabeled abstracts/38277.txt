Invasion of the exotic slug, Laevicaulis haroldi Dundee, 1980 in Sunderban Biosphere Reserve, India
The members of the heterobranch family Veronicellidae Gray, 1840 (commonly referred to as leatherleaf slugs) include some of the most widespread and agriculturally damaging invasive slugs. In a recent survey at Sagar Island of Sunderban Biosphere Reserve, four specimens hitherto unknown from the Reserve were collected. The specimens were identified as Laevicaulis haroldi Dundee, 1980, a native of South Africa. The first observation of this species in India was noted during 2005 in Maharashtra and recently from Uttar Pradesh. The current record from West Bengal affirmed this slug to be an invasive alien species in India. Categorized as IUCN-Endangered in its native range, this species might have a wider distribution in India. In addition, the current study underscores the need of identifying invasive alien species and quantifying their population dynamics in India.
