Heritable bacterial endosymbionts in native and invasive populations of Harmonia axyridis
Harmonia axyridis Pallas (1773) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is the well-studied system of invasive insect species. Native and invasive parts of the area of H. axyridis are isolated geographically. We studied the species composition and the distribution of bacterial symbionts Spiroplasma and Rickettsia in seven localities of the native area and six localities of the invasive area of H. axyridis. Rickettsia was detected in H. axyridis populations for the first time. We found that the proportion of beetles infected with Rickettsia in native and invasive populations of H. axyridis is about 0.03. Spiroplasma was found only in native populations of H. axyridis. The proportion of infected individuals with Spiroplasma in native populations of H. axyridis is about 0.08. All studied native populations of H. axyridis are infected with Spiroplasma, while all invasive populations are not. We discuss the possible influence of Spiroplasma and Rickettsia in the formation of invasive populations of H. axyridis.
