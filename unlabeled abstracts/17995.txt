The polyploid nature of Cenchrus ciliaris L. (Poaceae) has been overlooked: new insights for the conservation and invasion biology of this species - a review
Climate change, associated with increased aridity, and high grazing pressure by livestock results in the scarcity and loss of perennial Poaceae in arid ecosystems. The species threatened by this include Cenchrus ciliaris L., a native perennial grass of the tropical and sub-tropical arid rangelands of Africa and Western Asia and now introduced in Central and South America, and Australia. This species reproduces predominantly through aposporous apomixis although sexual individuals have been occasionally identified. Cenchrus ciliaris is characterised by a significant, heritable, phenotypic polymorphism and three ploidy levels including tetraploids (2n = 4x = 36), pentaploids (2n = 5x = 45) and hexaploids (2n = 6x = 54). Under water-deficit conditions, C. ciliaris shows plasticity in growth characteristics and aboveground biomass. This phenotypic plasticity has led to the identification of genotypic-associated responses conferring more productivity. This underlines the importance of conserving the genetic diversity of C. ciliaris in order to ensure the persistence of the vegetation cover in the arid ecosystems in which it occurs. Observations from cytogenetic and molecular data converge to underline the possibility of sexual reproduction, recombination and gene flow within and between populations of C. ciliaris. Genetic mechanisms, such as polyploidy, hybridisation between ploidy levels and apomixes, are generating and then maintaining the diversity of C. ciliaris. This review emphasises the role of polyploidy in the evolutionary development of C. ciliaris and how it may be a crucial factor for its conservation in some countries and its weedy nature in others.
