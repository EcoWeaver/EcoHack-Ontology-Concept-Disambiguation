Colonization and dispersal patterns of the invasive American brine shrimp Artemia franciscana (Branchiopoda: Anostraca) in the Mediterranean region
Cysts of the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana are harvested from the Great Salt Lake (GSL) and San Francisco Bay saltworks (SFB) in the U.S.A, and marketed worldwide to provide live food for aquaculture. This species has become invasive across several countries. We investigated (1) if the introduced populations in the Mediterranean region could have originated from these U.S.A. populations, (2) how the genetic diversity of the Mediterranean compares with that at GSL and SFB, and (3) if genetic patterns in Mediterranean can shed light on colonization routes. We sequenced a fragment of the Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I and screened microsatellites loci from Mediterranean populations and the two putative U.S.A. sources. Haplotypes from Mediterranean populations were identical or closely related to those from SFB and GSL, and not related to other available American populations. Microsatellite analyses showed a reduced population diversity for most Mediterranean populations suggesting bottleneck effects, but few populations showing similar or higher genetic diversity than native ones, which are likely to be admixed from both GSL and SFB due to multiple introductions. Results suggest natural dispersal, potentially via flamingos, between two Spanish populations. Our analyses show that all invaded populations could have originated from those commercialised U.S.A. populations.
