Evaluating host use of an accidentally introduced herbivore on two invasive toadflaxes
The distribution of phytophagous insects is influenced by their preference for and performance on their host plants. Biological control agents of invasive plants that prefer and perform better on their target hosts are more likely to be both effective and safe.Brachypterolus pulicarius is an herbivore used in North America to combat two invasive plants, yellow toadflax and Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria vulgaris and Linaria dalmatica). Adult beetles prefer yellow toadflax over Dalmatian toadflax, and when beetles are redistributed onto Dalmatian toadflax, populations do not consistently establish. This leads to the hypothesis that beetle larvae will perform best on yellow toadflax. A reciprocal transfer experiment was conducted to test this hypothesis. Development rate, pupal mass and percent survival were measured to assess larval performance. Development time was influenced by an interaction between the source host and the test host, a pattern suggesting that it is important to consider both the collection host and redistribution host when releasing this beetle for the control of toadflax. Pupal mass of larvae reared on yellow toadflax was, on average, 13% greater than that of larvae reared on Dalmatian toadflax, supporting the hypothesis. Survival rate was not significantly influenced by source host, test host, or their interaction, suggesting that survival rates will be similar no matter the combination of collection host and redistribution host. These results, along with the preference that adult beetles show for yellow toadflax, do not support the redistribution of B. pulicarius onto Dalmatian toadflax in North America.
