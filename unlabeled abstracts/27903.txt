Agonism and shelter competition between invasive and indigenous crayfish species
Several crayfish species behave as biological invaders. Their establishment in an area has frequently been accompanied by the reduction or elimination of indigenous species. A laboratory study was designed to investigate whether the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852) is dominant over the indigenous (to Delaware) crayfish Procambarus acutus acutus (Girard, 1852) in either the absence or the presence of a shelter as a limited resource. As expected, we found that P. clarkii is more aggressive than the similarly sized P. a. acutus, thus confirming previous studies that demonstrated an inherent dominance of the invasive over the indigenous crayfish. We then hypothesized that species showing a lower preference for an offered shelter (P. clarkii) should be less motivated to defend it. To the contrary, in a competitive context P. clarkii excluded P. a. acutus from the shelter but did not use the resource. Caution must be used in extrapolating these laboratory studies to the field, and future studies should analyze multiple factors, including the autoecology of the two species and their reproductive potential and recruitment patterns. However, our results might help in highlighting the risks for freshwater biodiversity created by the uncontrolled translocations of P. clarkii and other similar invasive species.
