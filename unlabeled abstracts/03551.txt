Greater seasonal carbon gain across a broad temperature range contributes to the invasive potential of Phalaris arundinacea (Poaceae; reed canary grass) over the native sedge Carex stricta (Cyperaceae).
Most invasive plants grow faster and produce more biomass than the species that they displace, but physiological mechanisms leading to invasive success are poorly understood. To foster novel control approaches, our goal was to determine whether the grass Phalaris arundinacea possessed superior physiological strategies that contributed to its success over native sedges. Data for spring, summer, and autumn diel gas-exchange, leaf morphology, and nitrogen content for plants of P. arundinacea and Carex stricta in water-saturated, drained, and periodically flooded sites in northern Indiana, USA, were compared with similar data for plants in a greenhouse. Phalaris arundinacea had higher maximum CO(2) assimilation (A) across a broad range of temperatures, greater summer/autumn net carbon gain, higher water use efficiencies, larger leaf areas per shoot, and higher specific leaf areas than did C. stricta. Species differences in gas-exchange data were similar in the greenhouse. However, long-term flooding reduced A for P. arundinacea. Greater declines in leaf A and nitrogen content from July to October compared to P. arundinacea were suggestive of earlier leaf senescence for C. stricta. We propose that superior daily and seasonal carbon gain, especially during rhizome carbohydrate storage in the summer and autumn, contribute to the success of invasive P. arundinacea over C. stricta. This advantage may be enhanced by frequent summer/autumn heat waves. The poor performance of P. arundinacea during long-term flooding is consistent with C. stricta's dominance in water-saturated soil, implying that water management strategies could be crucial to controlling P. arundinacea.
