Parasites in the northern Wadden Sea: a conservative ecosystem component over 4 decades
We investigated potential changes in the metazoan endoparasite fauna in the northern Wadden Sea during the past 4decades by compiling published studies, reports and original data. During the time considered, the parasite fauna has remained basically the same. Only a few changes in parasite species presence occurred that resulted from changes in host distribution and abundance. The introduction of potential host species had little effect on the parasite community because no alien parasites were concomitantly introduced and the native parasites show low prevalence and intensity in these novel hosts. Eutrophication and effects of phased-out hunting may not have had clear bottom-up or top-down effects on the parasite community because of various confounding factors. Parasites depending on several host species may only be subject to strong population changes if all hosts are affected in a unidirectional way. This, however, is rather unlikely to happen in a coastal ecosystem subject to multiple pressures. Hence, parasites appear to be a relatively conservative component of the northern Wadden Sea.
