Parametres environnementaux conditionnant l'etablissement d'une espece aquatique envahissante (Ciona intestinalis), Ile-du-Prince-Edouard, Canada
Prince Edward Island has experienced the introduction of non-native invasive tunicates in recent years. In the Brudenell and Montague rivers, tunicate populations have reached high levels, impacting populations of native species occupying the same ecological niche (blue mussel and oyster) and also fishing, aquaculture, and the local economy. Nevertheless, Orwell Bay is an exception to the success of the establishment of tunicates. The objective of this research is to identify, through an exploratory comparative approach, specific factors affecting the establishment of the invasive species Ciona intestinalis in Prince Edward Island. Three methods were used: 1) an estimate of the potential loss of soil based on a geographic information system, 2) hydrodynamic modeling of water renewal over time, and 3) an analysis of environmental variables of water quality. The Orwell Bay is characterized by a slightly larger proportion of areas with a higher potential of soil loss, a shorter time of water renewal in a shallower aquatic environment, higher turbidity and temperature as well as slightly lower salinity when compared to the Montague and Brudenell river systems. All of these factors could influence the establishment of tunicates.
