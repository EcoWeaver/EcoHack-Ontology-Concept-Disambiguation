AbstractOf the 37 species of the European Union concern eight are already present and two present a future potential risk for Romania. This paper brings updated information regarding these species in Romania. The presence of eight invasive alien species of concern to the European Union have already been recorded in Romania: two plant speciesCabomba carolinianaandHeracleum sosnowskyi, two crustaceansOrconectes limosusandEriocheir sinensis, two fish speciesPseudorasbora parvaandPerccottus glenii, one reptileTrachemys scriptaand one mammalMyocastor coypus. Other two species of Union concern (Lithobates catesbeianusandProcyon lotor) may soon become invaders in Romania. We emphasize the urgent need to assess their current distribution and impact or potential to establish and possible impact at national level.
