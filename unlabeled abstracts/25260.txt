Occupation, body size and sex ratio of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in established and newly invaded areas of an Ontario river
Invasive species represent a challenge because the particular characteristics of a species' invasion are often unknown before the invasion. To provide some clarity as to how invasive species demographic structure might change as a population advances its range, we compared the proportion of occupied sites, size structure and sex ratio of round gobies in the area where they first invaded with more recently invaded areas at the extent of their range in a river in south-eastern Ontario. We used a standardized angling technique to sample gobies larger than 45-mm total length in the summer and early autumn of 2007. Round goby at the upstream and downstream extent of their range occupied a lower proportion of randomly selected sites, and contained a wider distribution of sizes as well as significantly larger individuals. Sex ratios in all areas were male-biased and the male-to-female ratio was significantly higher in the upstream segment of the river (2.2:1) compared to the area of first introduction (1.4:1). The difference between the newly invaded and the established sites suggests that round goby population structure may be affected by density. The results of this study help us further describe the demographic characteristics of biological invasions whilst examples of population structure and behaviour in gobies and other species provide a basis for generating hypotheses for range expansion.
