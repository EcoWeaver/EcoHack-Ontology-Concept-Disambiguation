Dramatic expansion of the range of the invasive ash pest, buprestid beetle Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, 1888 (Coleoptera, Buprestidae) in European Russia
The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, 1888) is a dangerous invasive pest of ashes. It was previously believed that in European Russia it occurs only in Moscow, Moscow Province, and in the eastern regions of Smolensk Province. An examination of ash trees in 12 cities of European Russia has revealed a much wider area of the emerald ash borer invasion. The pest was found in Konakovo (Tver Province), Tula, Kaluga, Orel, and Voronezh. We have found that A. planipennis damages not only Fraxinus pennsylvanica (an American species which is commonly planted in cities), but also the aborigine European ash Fraxinus excelsior. Ashes in the European forests and in the protective forest belts are badly endangered. The emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis Fair-maire, 1888 is the most dangerous trunk pest of ash-trees. Invasion of this Asian beetle into North America has led to killing tens of millions trees (Emerald Ash Borer Website, 2013), and now the insect attacks the territory of Central Russia.
