Divergent adaptations in different parts of introduced range in tetraploid Vicia cracca
Understanding causes of species invasiveness is a necessary condition for effective mitigation of invasive species. One of the key characteristics supporting species invasiveness may be species ability to adapt to wide range of environmental conditions. It has been hypothesized that increased ability to adapt to wide range of conditions may be related to polyploidization. Experimental studies comparing the ability to adapt to novel conditions between native and invasive populations of different cytotypes of the same species are, however, still largely missing.
