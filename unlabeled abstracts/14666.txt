Predicting abundance with presence-only models
Context Understanding and predicting the spatial patterns of species abundance is a critical need in macroecology. But, widespread abundance data are rare, and habitat models based on species occurrences are typically poor predictors of abundance. Objectives I ask whether presence-only species distribution models based on locations of high species abundance can more effectively predict abundance than models based on occurrences. Methods I created climatic suitability models for fifteen problematic, non-native, invasive plants in the continental US using each of three datasets (1) occurrence data derived from herbarium records, (2) occurrence data derived from regional expert knowledge surveys, and (3) locations of high invasive plant abundance derived from regional expert knowledge surveys. Results Models based on occurrences from regional surveys were most effective for distinguishing presence from absence. Models based on locations of high abundance were most effective for characterizing both intermediate and high ranks of abundance. Occurrence data from herbarium records were poor predictors of both presence and abundance. Conclusions This analysis suggests that climate suitable for abundant populations is predictable with species distribution modeling, but not using distribution data alone. High probability of species occurrence does not equal high probability of species abundance, suggesting environmental factors differentially influence abundance and distribution. This difference highlights the need for a macrosystems approach to regional habitat modeling to consider how local-scale processes (e.g., biotic interactions) affect regional patterns. Moreover, as abundance is critical for understanding species roles and impacts on ecosystems, large-scale surveys of quantitative or qualitative species abundance are strongly needed.
