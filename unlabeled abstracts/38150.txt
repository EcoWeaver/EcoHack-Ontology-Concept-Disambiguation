Biological and ecological traits that assist establishment of alien invasive insects
In this study the biological and ecological traits of two groups of phytophagous insect pests were examined to determine attributes that may influence establishment in New Zealand. Biological and ecological attributes of a group of insect species that is established in New Zealand were compared with species that are not currently established. It was found that the species established in New Zealand had a significantly wider host plant range than species that have not established. The lower developmental threshold temperature was, on average, 4degC lower for established species compared with non-established species.These data suggest that species that establish well in New Zealand have a wide host range and can tolerate lower temperatures compared with those that have not established.
