Protectionism versus risk in screening for invasive species
I examine the use of border inspections as a barrier to trade. I present a theoretical model of screening agricultural imports for non-indigenous species (NIS) which identifies a weight placed on domestic producer surplus relative to domestic consumer surplus, independent of NIS risk. The theoretical model is estimated in its structural form using a dataset which documents the outcomes of US agricultural border inspections. I present evidence suggesting that inspection protocols are implemented in a manner which favors domestic producers over domestic consumers. The estimated weights imply domestic consumer welfare is valued at between 94 and 65 percent of domestic producer welfare. I also find that the inspection agency behaves as if NIS damages range from $0 to $0.07 for every dollar of inspected imports.
