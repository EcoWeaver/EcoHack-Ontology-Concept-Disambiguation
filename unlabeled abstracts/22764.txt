Demography and dispersal: invasion speeds and sensitivity analysis in periodic and stochastic environments
Invasion speeds can be calculated from matrix integrodifference equation models that incorporate stage-specific demography and dispersal. These models also permit the calculation of the sensitivity and elasticity of invasion speed to changes in demographic and dispersal parameters. Such calculations have been used to understand the factors determining invasion speed and to explore possible tactics to manage invasive species. In this paper, we extend these calculations to temporally varying environments. We present formulas for the invasion speed and its sensitivity and elasticity in both periodic and stochastic environments. Periodic models can describe seasonal variation within a year, or can be used to study the frequency of occurrence of events (e.g., floods, fires) on interannual time scales. Stochastic models can incorporate variances, covariances, and temporal autocorrelation of parameters. We show that the invasion speed is calculated from a growth rate which is in turn calculated from a periodic or stochastic product of moment-generating function matrices. We present a new formulation of sensitivity analysis, using matrix calculus, that applies equally to constant, periodic, and stochastic environments.
