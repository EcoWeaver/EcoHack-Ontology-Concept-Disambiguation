Lantana camara invasion in urban forests of an Indo-Burma hotspot region and its ecosustainable management implication through biomonitoring of particulate matter
Present study was performed in urban forests of Aizawl, Mizoram, North East India falling under an Indo-Burma hot spot region of existing ecological relevance and pristine environment. Phyto-sociolology of invasive weeds has been performed and results revealed that Lantana camara was the most dominant invasive weed. Further, the air quality studies revealed high suspended particulate matter (SPM) as well as (RSPM) in ambient air of Aizawl, Mizoram, North East India. Bio- monitoring through plant leaves has been recognised as recent thrust area in the field of particulate matter (PM) science. We aimed to investigate that whether Lantana camara leaves may act as biomonitoring tool hence an attempt towards its sustainable management. The quantity of RSPM and SPM at four different sites were much higher than the prescribed limits of Central Pollution Control Board of India during summer and winter season. The dust deposition of Lantana camara leaves was found 1.01 mg/cm2 and pertaining to the biochemical parameters, pH was found 7.49, Relative water content (RWC) was found 73.74 %, Total chlorophyll (TCH) was found 1.91, (Ascorbic Acid) AA was found 7.06 mg/g, sugar was found 0.16 mg/g, protein was found 0.67 mg/g, catalase was found 30.76 U/mg protein, peroxidase was found 0.16 U/mg protein and APTI was found 12.91. Lantana camara was observed in good category in Anticipated Performance Index (API) which shows the tolerant and conditioning capacity of air pollution. Therefore, present study recommended the use of Lantana camara as biomonitor which may further have sustainable management implications of an invasive plant.
