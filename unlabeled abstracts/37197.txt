Changes in the fish community of the Omerli Reservoir (Turkey) following the introduction of non-native gibel carp Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782) and other human impacts
Changes in the relative density (catch per unit effort; CPUE) of introduced gibel carp Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782) and native fish species were monitored over four years in the Omerli Reservoir, a temperate drinking-water reservoir in northwestern Turkey. Following the species' introduction, the CPUE of gibel carp increased significantly with the decrease in CPUE of large- bodied native fish species.
