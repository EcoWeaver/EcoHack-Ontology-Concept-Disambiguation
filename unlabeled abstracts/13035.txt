Notes relating to William Roxburgh's study of the flora of St Helena
Shortly after his death in 1815, a report written by William Roxburgh on the flora of the Atlantic island of St Helena was published by Alexander Beatson. Roxburgh spent 10 months on the island in 1813 - 1814 in an attempt to recover his health. Some of Roxburgh's names for the indigenous plants have still not been typified. Eleven native taxa are dealt with here with three new lectotypes and seven new neotypes. The relevance of the St Helena publication for the nomenclature of exotic species seems not to have been appreciated. Roxburgh published a new combination for an orchid species, the name Rosa triphylla for the Cherokee rose and names in the genus Scytalia for the Asian fruit trees: lychee, longan and rambutan. A neotype is selected for Rosa triphylla and lectotypes for Rosa anemoniflora Fortune ex Lindl. and Scytalia litchi.
