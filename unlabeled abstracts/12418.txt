Addressing the needs for improving classical biological control programs in the USA
For years, the development of classical biological has proven to be the most cost-effective and environmentally safe management tool for invasive species. Despite this, in the United States there are a number of political, regulatory and institutional challenges associated with the discovery stage, pre-release phase, and post-release monitoring that have restricted the full potential and the long-term success of many classical biological control programs. Among these needs, we provide recommendations for improved prioritization of specific projects, funding concerns, source countries issues, benefits sharing of biological control agents, shipping live agents, regulatory requirements and procedures, and engagement with the environmental community. We believe these recommendations and potential solutions will significantly improve the future effectiveness of classical biological control programs for the management of invasive species within the United States.
