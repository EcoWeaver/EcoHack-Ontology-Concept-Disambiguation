The utility of Sentinel-2 Vegetation Indices (VIs) and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for invasive alien species detection and mapping
The threat of invasive alien plant species is progressively becoming a serious global concern. Alien plant invasions adversely affect both ecological services and socio-economic systems. Hence, accurate detection and mapping of invasive alien species is valuable in mitigating adverse ecological and socio-economic effects. Recent advances in active and passive remote sensing technology have created new and cost-effective opportunities for the application of remote sensing to invasive species mapping. In this study, new generation Sentinel-2 (S2) optical imagery was compared to S2 derived Vegetation Indices (VIs) and S2 VIs fused with Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for detecting and mapping the American Bramble (Rubuscuneifolius). Fusion of S2 VIs and S1SAR imagery was conducted at pixel level and multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) image classification was used to determine the dominant land use land cover classes. Results indicated that S2 derived VIs were the most accurate (80%) in detecting and mapping Bramble, while fused S2 VIs and S1SAR were the least accurate (54%). Findings from this study suggest that the application of S2 VIs is more suitable for Bramble detection and mapping than the fused S2 VIs and S1SAR. The superior performance of S2 VIs highlights the value of the new generation S2 VIs for invasive alien species detection and mapping. Furthermore, this study recommends the use of freely available new generation satellite imagery for cost effective and timeous mapping of Bramble from surrounding native vegetation and other land use land cover types.
