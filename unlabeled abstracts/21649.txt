Some distinctive subject contributions from tropical Africa to fundamental science of inland waters
A short account is given of some features that are unique or extensively developed or intensely studied in tropical African water-bodies, and which are of fundamental limnological significance. They concern the origin and persistence of lakes and rivers; local evolution (endemism) and dispersal of species; cyclic lake stratification in relation to latitude and climate; salinity series and nutrient balance; plankton dynamics; aquatic food chains that are simplified and quantifiable or with major recent change; colonisation of new or transient water bodies by extensively invasive species; and the significance of temperature difference and absolute magnitude as ecological factors.
