Early resistance of alien and native pines against two native generalist insect herbivores: no support for the natural enemy hypothesis
1. The natural enemy hypothesis (NEH) predicts that alien plant species might receive less pressure from natural enemies than do related coexisting native plants. However, most studies to date are based on pairs of native and alien species, and the results remain inconclusive. The level of attack by native generalist herbivores can vary considerably between plant species, depending on defensive traits and strategies. Plant defences include preformed constitutive and induced defences that are activated as plastic responses to herbivore attack. However, the efficacy of induced defences could be altered when alien species entering an area are exposed to native enemies.
