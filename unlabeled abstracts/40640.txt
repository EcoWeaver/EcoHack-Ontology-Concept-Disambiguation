Biotic resistance and the spatiotemporal distribution of an invading woodwasp, Sirex noctilio
Quantifying the strength of interactions among introduced and native species across space and time is critical in understanding biological invasions as they can attenuate or amplify the magnitude of impact. The European woodwasp, Sirex noctilio F., a global threat to pines, is a recent invader to North America. It attacks and kills primarily Pinus resinosa and Pinus sylvestris, and encounters a diverse assemblage of potential ompetitors for this resource. We quantified spatial colonization patterns of this woodwasp and resident competitors including scolytine bark beetles, woodboring cerambycid and buprestid beetles, and the fungal root rot diseases Armillaria and Heterobasidion across an 80 year old pine plantation over 4 years. All xylophages were spatially aggregated, but only on a localized scale of 15-20 m. Colonizers occurred non-randomly within trees, with S. noctilio negatively or neutrally associated with all other colonizing agents, whereas all other insect and root rot colonizers were mostly positively coassociated. An autologistic regression with spatially weighted variables indicated the probability of a dead tree exhibiting symptoms of S. noctilio attack was positively associated with tree density, host species (P. sylvestris), and density of S. noctilio-attacked trees from the current and previous year. Interspecific stand patterns were weaker; probability of attack was negatively associated only with root rot pathogens. Across spatial scales, there were mixed (woodborers) and neutral (bark beetles) associations between S. noctilio and other co-colonizing insects. Our results suggest that competitive interactions with resident species may be contributing to the limited success of S. noctilio in North America, but are unlikely to be driving it by themselves.
