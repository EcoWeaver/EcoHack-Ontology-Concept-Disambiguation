Differences in functional traits and reproductive allocations between native and invasive plants
Because co-occurring native and invasive plants are subjected to similar environmental selection pressures, the differences in functional traits and reproductive allocation strategies between native and invasive plants may be closely related to the success of the latter. Accordingly, this study examines differences in functional traits and reproductive allocation strategies between native and invasive plants in Eastern China. Plant height, branch number, reproductive branch number, the belowground-to-aboveground biomass ratio, and the reproductive allocation coefficient of invasive plants were all notably higher than those of native species. Additionally, the specific leaf area (SLA) values of invasive plants were remarkably lower than those of native species. Plasticity indexes of SLA, maximum branch angle, and branch number of invasive plants were each notably lower than those of native species. The reproductive allocation coefficient was positively correlated with reproductive branch number and the belowground-to-aboveground biomass ratio but exhibited negative correlations with SLA and aboveground biomass. Plant height, branch number, reproductive branch number, the belowground-to-aboveground biomass ratio, and the reproductive allocation coefficient of invasive plants may strongly influence the success of their invasions.
