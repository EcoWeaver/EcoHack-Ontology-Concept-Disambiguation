Eurasian watermilfoil in the Tennessee Valley
Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.), a submersed aquatic weed, has seriously interfered with many water uses in the TVA reservoirs. More than 150 test plots were treated with 34 herbicides from 1960 through 1965. More effective results were obtained with granular preparations of butoxyethanol ester, 2-ethyl hexanol ester, and propylene glycol butyl ether ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and liquid preparations of propylene glycol butyl ether ester and potassium salt of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex). The two most effective control methods found from field tests were (a) lowering the lake levels enough to permit complete drying of stems and root crowns and (b) applying butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-D in a 20% granular form. Applications of this herbicide to about 3,700 acres at rates of 20 and 40 lb/A gave results that varied from excellent control in protected embayments to poor control in moving water on these large impoundments.
