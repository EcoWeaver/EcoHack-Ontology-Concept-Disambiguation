An invasive pest of bumblebee: A new record of the tracheal mite Locustacarus buchneri (Acari: Podapolipidae) from the European bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in Korea
Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are important pollinators of agricultural crops and wild plants, especially tomato and sweet pepper species requiring large-sized and buzzing pollinators. The endoparasitic mite Locustacarus buchneri Stammer 1951 (Acari; Podapolipidae) was identified from commercial populations of the introduced European bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We report the genus and species of this mite for the first time in Koran fauna. Identification was based on morphological and molecular characteristics. Morphological details were illustrated and compared with those to the original description. We analyzed partial cytochrome oxidase I gene to understand the phylogenetic relationship and possible source of invention. The maximum likelihood tree and haplotype network revealed that the Korean population is closely related to Japanese population than European population. The ecological significance of this finding and possible consequences of the invasive species to the native species are discussed.
