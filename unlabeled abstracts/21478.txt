Assessing the importance of disturbance, site conditions, and the biotic barrier for dandelion invasion in an Alpine habitat
Several factors have been identified as relevant in determining the abundance of non-native invasive species. Nevertheless, the relative importance of these factors will vary depending on the invaded habitat and the characteristics of the invasive species. Due to their harsh environmental conditions and remoteness, high-alpine habitats are often considered to be at low risk of plant invasion. However, an increasing number of reports have shown the presence and spread of non-native plant species in alpine habitats; thus, it is important to study which factors control the invasion process in these harsh habitats. In this study, we assessed the role of disturbance, soil characteristics, biotic resistance and seed rain in the establishment and abundance of the non-native invasive species Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) in the Andes of central Chile. By focusing on human-disturbed patches, naturally disturbed patches, and undisturbed patches, we did not find that disturbance per se, or its origin, affected the establishment and abundance of T. officinale. The abundance of this non-native invasive species was not negatively related to the diversity of native species at local scales, indicating no biotic resistance to invasion; instead, some positive relationships were found. Our results indicate that propagule pressure (assessed by the seed rain) and the abiotic soil characteristics are the main factors related to the abundance of this non-native invasive species. Hence, in contrast to what has been found for more benign habitats, disturbance and biotic resistance have little influence on the invasibility of T. officinale in this high-alpine habitat.
