Fertilization of green frog (Rana clamitans) eggs in their native jelly by bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) sperm
Fertilization of R. clamitans eggs in their native jelly occurred when inseminated with high concentrations of R. catesbeiana sperm. Contrary to previous evidence, the block to cross-fertilization of the R. clamitans egg is not complete. This raises the possibility that R. clamitans x R. catesbeiana hybrids may form in nature.
