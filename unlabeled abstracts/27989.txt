Helminth Parasites of Freshwater Fishes of the Panuco River Basin, East Central Mexico
This study presents results from a survey of helminth parasites of fishes in the Panuco River basin, in the states of San Luis Potosi, Hidalgo, Queretaro and Guanajuato, all in east central Mexico. Seventeen freshwater fish species (n = 1,019) were examined for helminths between May 1997 and September 1998. Thirty-one helminth species were collected: 11 allogenic species, mostly Nearctic in origin, and 20 autogenic species. Two anthropogenically introduced species were recorded. The most prevalent and widespread helminth taxon was Posthodiplostomum minimum (metacercariae). The helminth fauna of fishes of the Panuco River is dominated by trematodes (12 species) and nematodes (11 species) accompanied by a few monogenean (4 species), cestode (3 species), and acanthocephalan (1 species) taxa. Most of the helminth taxa reported have been reported from other regions of Mexico. Thus, the helminth parasite fauna of fishes of the Panuco River basin are not exclusive, including a primordially autogenic Neotropical species component mixed with a mainly allogenic, globally distributed Nearctic species component. The regional freshwater fish helminth fauna is associated with the ichthyofaunanal composition of the basin. The nematode family Rhabdochonidae displays high species richness in this hydrological basin of Mexico.
