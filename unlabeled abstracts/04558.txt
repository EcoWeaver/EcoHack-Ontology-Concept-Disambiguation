Does native bromeliads represent important breeding sites for Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) in urbanized areas?
This study evaluates the importance of native bromeliads growing on rocky outcrops interspersed with urbanized areas as breeding sites for the Aedes aegypti (L.) in Vitoria, state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. Oviposition traps were installed in backyards of houses in two separate zones. In the first zone houses were up to 50 m away from the rocky outcrops, while in the second zone they were at least at 200 m from the rocky outcrops. Aedes aegypti was significantly more abundant in the latter zone. The finding was that rocky outcrops with native bromeliads, even with the greater availability of potential breeding sites, do not play an important role as breeding sites for A. aegypti. This conclusion supports the hypothesis that the macrobiota of native bromeliads plays an important role in the natural control of A. aegypti. Besides, the interspecific competition between species of mosquitoes and the attractiveness of bromeliads could also be important factors.
