Invasive Plant Species: Results of a Consumer Awareness, Knowledge, and Expectations Survey Conducted in Pennsylvania
Consumers were surveyed at the 2004 Philadelphia Flower Show in Philadelphia, PA, from March 8-10, to quantify their attitudes and behaviors towards invasive plant species and potential problems associated with purchasing and planting them. A majority of the 341 participants (81.5%) was aware that non-native plants were used in the landscape and that these plants may be invasive in natural areas. Less than half (40.1%) acknowledged owning plants considered invasive while one third (33.5%) did not know if these plants were growing in their landscapes. Less than half (41.3%) believed that laws should be passed to prevent the sale of non-native plants while 27.8% believed that laws should be passed to allow sale of only native plants in their area. Three distinct consumer segments were identified using Cluster Analysis: 'Invasive savvy,' participants knowledgeable about invasives and interested in alternative species; 'Invasive neutral,' participants neutral in their decision to purchase alternatives to invasive plants and price sensitive about paying more for plants tested for invasiveness; and 'Invasive inactive,' participants were not price sensitive to paying more for plants tested for invasiveness, however, they appeared to oppose the purchase of plants previously listed as invasive which would be available as seedless through breeding and natural selection or other forms of genetic modification. Survey results indicated that media sources (e.g., television and print media) would be effective for educating consumers about potential problems associated with invasive species in the landscape.
