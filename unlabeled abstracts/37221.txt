First record of the invasive snail Myosotella myosotis (Draparnaud, 1801) in coast Shatt al-Arab estuary/ Al-Faw District, Basrah-Iraq
The present study investigated the first record of invasive mouse-ear snail Myosotella myosotis (Draparnaud, 1801) (Pulmonata: Basommatophora: Ellobiidae) in Shatt al-Arab estuary coast north the District of Al- Faw, Basrah, Iraq. During a period from January to December 2019, one sample was collected monthly from two selected sites in Shatt al-Arab estuary shoreline. Some biological, and ecological notes on this ellobiid gastropod from Iraqi coast in addition to photographs, were provided to confirm the identification of the snail, provided with brief comments on its measured morphological features. Results showed that the mean population density of both the two study sites of M. myosotis ranged from 66 ind./m2 during April at site 1 and 0 ind./m2 in some other months at site 2.
