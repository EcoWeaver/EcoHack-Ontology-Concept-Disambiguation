Economic value of damage caused by marine bio-invasions: lessons from two European case studies
Abstract Nunes, P. A. L. D., and Markandya, A. 2008. Economic value of damage caused by marine bio-invasions: lessons from two European case studies. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 775-780. We illustrate the use of alternative, non-market valuation methods to estimate the economic value of the social damage caused by marine bio-invasions. First, we present and discuss the motivation to perform an economic valuation of marine ecosystem quality in general and the protection of marine ecosystems against invasive species in particular. Second, we examine in detail two empirical applications of economic value assessment of social damage attributable to marine bio-invasions. One of these looks at ballast water management programmes in Rotterdam harbour, the Netherlands, and the second investigates management practices for the Manila clam in Venice Lagoon. Finally, we explore the relevance of this economic information for cost-benefit analysis and policy guidance.
