Predicting the invasion of the acoustic niche: Potential distribution and call transmission efficiency of a newly introduced frog in Cuba
Leptodactylus fragilis is a recently introduced frog in Cuba, where it may impact local populations of amphibians in different ways. Here, we combined two methods to predict the invasion of the acoustic niche of Cuban amphibians by L. fragilis. We first use species distribution models to predict the spread and establishment of L. fragilis in Cuba. We then performed sound propagation experiments to evaluate the potential invasion of the acoustic niche in predicted suitable areas for the presence of L. fragilis. This species could have a successful establishment, spreading mainly in open areas, where its advertisement calls propagate efficiently, with low attenuation and discrete temporal-spectral degradation at short distances. The optimal transmission of acoustic signals in such areas might interfere with the acoustic communication of the endemic bufonid Peltophryne empusa, with potential negative effects on mate choice and breeding success. Predictions of habitat suitability, in combination with evidences of optimal transmission of advertisement calls of invasive amphibians, could be a valuable tool for rapid prediction of the potential impact of such species and the identification of prioritized areas to implement management strategies.
