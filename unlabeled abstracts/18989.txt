The round goby Neogobius melanostomus first recorded in the Netherlands
In December 2004 two specimens of round goby, Neogobius melanostomus were caught in the river Lek near Schoonhoven (The Netherlands), which is a first record of this invasive Ponto-Caspian fish in the North Sea basin. After this first observation many individuals have been caught on different locations in the western part of the country. As in the North American Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea, the native fish species could become locally endangered due to competition with new invader. Therefore, the species should be monitored closely to determine its present distribution area as well as the impact on the ecosystem.
