Chromolaena odorata invasion in Guinea-Bissau (West Africa): first records and trends of expansion
The Siam weed, Chromolaena odorata (L.) R. M. King & H. Rob. (Asteraceae), is recognized as one of the world's worst tropical weeds. It is a perennial herb or shrub native to the neotropics that has become invasive across the tropical regions of Africa, Asia and Oceania. The species was introduced in 1937 in Nigeria and later spread to neighboring countries. Its presence and effects have been documented in the upland zones of almost all West African countries. Although, until the present study, the species had not been recorded in Guinea-Bissau, its presence in the country was very likely. In this work we document, for the first time, the invasion of Guinea-Bissau by C. odorata, assessing its present distribution and reporting effects, local uses and common names. Dispersal trends, potential consequences of its expansion and recommendations for management and control are also presented.
