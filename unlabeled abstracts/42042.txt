Biotic Predictors Improve Species Distribution Models for Invasive Plants in Western U.S. Forests at High But Not Low Spatial Resolutions
Invasions by non-native plants threaten forest health and sustainability. The ability to predict areas at greatest risk to invasion is essential for informing both monitoring and management of invasive species. Species distribution models (SDMs) are often used to identify environmental correlates of a species' occurrence and predict geographic areas that may be suitable for its presence and are commonly constructed using solely abiotic predictors. However, mounting evidence implies that not including biotic predictors in SDMs may yield less accurate models at some resolutions typical of landscape-scale models, although this possibility has rarely been evaluated in invasive plants. In this study, we determined whether including descriptors of the biotic environment improved the accuracy of SDMs built at five decreasing spatial resolutions for infestations of five common invasive plants in forests of California, Oregon, and Washington, USA and described environmental correlates of each species' presence. Predictors of occurrence often echoed those identified in previous studies of the focal species, indicating that our models accurately identified important environmental drivers of occurrence. Including biotic predictors in the SDMs consistently improved model accuracy only at the highest resolution we examined, which may be due to the spatial scale at which biotic interactions primarily act to constrain species' distributions, the particular biotic predictors we used in our models, or correlations between attributes of the abiotic and biotic environment. This finding suggests that, while the practice of building SDMs using abiotic predictors alone may generally yield models whose accuracy does not differ substantially from those that also include biotic predictors, the effects of biotic interactions on the distribution of invasive plants in forests may be detectable at larger scales than previously thought.
