Asian grapevine leaf rust caused by Phakopsora euvitis : an important disease in Brazil
Anthropogenic influences such as tourism and climate change affect ecosystems. One consequence is that invasive species can spread to and colonize novel areas. A recent example of this scenario is the appearance in the early 2000s in Brazil and Australia of the plant pathogenic fungus Phakopsora euvitis which causes Asian grapevine leaf rust. It is speculated that the disease was introduced either by long distance transport of spores in the atmosphere or the import of contaminated plant material. While the disease could be eradicated from the Australian continent it is still present in Brazil. The pathogen has spread successfully throughout most Brazilian grapevine growing regions, most likely because of the lack of resistant plant cultivars. Today, the disease is endemic in Brazil. This review was written to highlight the increasing impact of the disease in Brazil. We sum up the current knowledge on the disease monocycle under different environmental conditions and the consequences for grapevine management. We highlight gaps in the present state of knowledge and would like to stimulate further research aimed at identifying efficient strategies to combat the disease.
