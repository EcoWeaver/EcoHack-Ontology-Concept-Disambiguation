High-value products from macroalgae: the potential uses of the invasive brown seaweed, Sargassum muticum
Marine seaweeds represent an abundant source of natural products and may harbour valuable chemicals. The brown seaweed Sargassum muticum is an invasive species to the coasts of the British Isles, mainland Europe and North America. Attempts at its eradication and control have generally not been successful, although time-consuming and costly Commercial exploration of this biomass for food, fuel and pharmaceutical products could encourage its harvesting and control. Though S. muticum might be unsuitable as a source of biofuel due to high ash and water content, this rapidly growing macroalga has a naturally high content of antioxidants, carotenoids and phenols, including the well-known anti-cancer com- pound fucoxanthin, making this species a potential source of a range of pharmaceutically relevant materials.
