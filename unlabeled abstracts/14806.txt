Invading Nova Scotia: first records of Didemnum vexillum Kott, 2002 and four more non-indigenous invertebrates in 2012 and 2013
Research and monitoring efforts led to the discovery of four new non-indigenous tunicates and one new non-indigenous anemone in Nova Scotia in 2012 and 2013. In this report, we summarize and interpret the circumstances leading up to and actions taken following the first Nova Scotian records of the high impact invasive tunicate Didemnum vexillum Kott, 2002 as well as the tunicates Styela clava Herdman, 1881, Ascidiella aspersa (Muller, 1776), and Diplosoma listerianum (Milne-Edwards, 1841) and the anemone Diadumene lineata (Verrill, 1869). While dockside research and monitoring were responsible for detections of four species, the possibility that Didemnum vexillum was present was first reported by a member of the public, through Fisheries and Oceans Canada's Aquatic Invasive Species Monitoring program.
