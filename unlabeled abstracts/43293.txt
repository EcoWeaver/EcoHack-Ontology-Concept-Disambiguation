Changes in selection pressure can facilitate hybridization during biological invasion in a Cuban lizard
Significance Hybridization is common in invasive species and can be important for their success. The connection between hybridization and bioinvasions could result in part because of a disruption in the selection pressures that limit hybridization in the native range. We demonstrate that, in the lizard Anolis sagrei , hybridization is rare in native populations, which show frequent evidence of natural selection at a large-effect X chromosome locus. Conversely, little selection at this locus was detected in invasive populations, which do not experience large-scale contemporary gene flow, but instead maintain a mosaic of hybrid ancestries formed during invasive range colonization. Ecological changes during biological invasions can affect hybridization frequency and stability, which can in turn drive the success of invasive taxa.
