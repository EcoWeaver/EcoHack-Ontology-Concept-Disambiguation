Resource Abundance and Invasiveness: A Simple Model
The 'invasiveness' of an alien species depends partly on its ability to become abundant and widespread in its new environment. While competitiveness may be an important component of this ability, so too is the abundance of resource or habitat. First, the local carrying capacity will depend on the local favourability of the habitat, hence the global density will depend on how widespread the habitat is. Second, and more subtly, the local density will also be affected by the global extent of favourable habitat, because of losses occasioned by dispersal when the population redistributes; these losses should be fewer the greater the contiguous area of favourable habitat or the more patches of such habitat across the landscape. Here we describe a model which demonstrates how habitat availability affects an invading speciesquilibrium abundance, hence its invasiveness. The model shows that local density is likely to be an increasing function of global habitat abundance, and global density to be a non-linear, concave-up function of global habitat abundance. Examples are given to support the model's predictions, taken largely from alien species in New Zealand.
