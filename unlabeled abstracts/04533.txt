Phylogeography of the invasive cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii
Planktonic Nostocales cyanobacteria represent a challenge for researchers because of the wide range of cyanotoxins they synthesize and their invasive behaviour, which is presumably enhanced by global warming [1]. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is a cyanobacterial species extensively studied for its toxicity, bloom formation, and invasiveness potential, which may have consequences to public and environmental health [2]. Its current geographical distribution, spanning different climates, suggests that C. raciborskii has acquired the status of a cosmopolitan species. Greece is considered as the origin of the expansion of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in Europe [3]. In the context of the present study, the phylogeography of the strain Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii TAUMAC 14144 isolated from Lake Karla and representing the first C. raciborskii strain isolated from Greek freshwaters, was assessed based on five molecular markers (16S rRNA, 16S-23S rRNA ITS, cpcBA-IGS, nifH, rpoc1). Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii TAU-MAC 1414 clustered with strains from Mediterranean regions (Italy, Spain), Northern Africa (Tunisia), Northern America, and South America, in contrast to the rest of European strains which were clustered with strains from Asia, Australia, and Central Africa (Uganda). All the markers examined revealed the same pattern, which led us to a dispersal hypothesis with primary center in South America. The hypothesis describes two dispersion routes: one to Northern America then to Northern Africa and from there to Mediterranean regions, and the second one to Central Africa then to Australia and Asia and from there to the rest of Europe. Our findings suggest an intriguing phylogeographic pattern in C. raciborskii species, providing new prospects for future microbiological research.
