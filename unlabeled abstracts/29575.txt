Occurrence of an Exotic Oligochaete Branchiura sowerbyi Beddard, 1892, in the River Thames
IN the course of a study of the bottom fauna of the River Thames just below Reading, a large population of Branchiura sowerbyi has been found among the roots of emergent aquatic plants such as Carex acutiformis, Acorus calamus and Schoenoplectus lacustris. Although samples have been taken from many parts of the River over a stretch of about two miles, all the specimens of Branchiura found hitherto have been from a region just below the warm water effluent of Earley power station. The distinctive characters of the worm are its large size compared with other members of the Tubificidae and the possession of filamentous gills on the mid-dorsal and mid-ventral lines of the posterior part of the body.
