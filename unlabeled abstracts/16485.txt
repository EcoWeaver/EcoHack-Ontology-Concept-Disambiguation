The diagnosis and treatment of invasive aspergillosis in Dutch haematology units facing a rapidly increasing prevalence of azole-resistance. A nationwide survey and rationale for the DB-MSG 002 study protocol
Background Patients with haematological malignancies are at risk for invasive fungal diseases (IFD). A survey was conducted in all Dutch academic haematology centres on their current diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic approach towards IFD in the context of azole resistance. Methods In all 8 centres, a haematologist and microbiologist filled in the questionnaire that focused on different subgroups of haematology patients. Results Fungal prophylaxis during neutropenia was directed against Candida and consisted of fluconazole and/or amphotericin B suspension. Mould-active prophylaxis was given to acute myeloid leukaemia patients during chemotherapy in two of eight centres. All centres used azole prophylaxis in a subset of patients with graft-versus-host disease. A uniform approach towards the diagnosis and treatment of IFD and in particular azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus was lacking. In 2017, all centres agreed to implement a uniform diagnostic and treatment algorithm regarding invasive aspergillosis with a central role for comprehensive diagnostics and PCR-based detection of azole resistance. This study (DB-MSG 002) will re-evaluate this algorithm when 280 patients have been treated. Discussion A heterogeneous approach towards antifungal prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment was apparent in the Netherlands. Facing triazole-resistance, consensus was reached on the implementation of a uniform diagnostic approach in all eight centres. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
