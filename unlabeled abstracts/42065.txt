Predation assessment of the invasive ctenophore <i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i> in a French Mediterranean lagoon
Since 2000, the invasive ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi has been recorded in Mediterranean brackish lagoons. Quantitative data on its feeding behaviour (i.e. potential ecological impact) in these particular environments is non-existent. In this study, we describe in situ predation dynamics of M. leidyi in the Berre Lagoon (south-eastern France) over a 22 months survey. Ctenophores were fixated in a solution of formalin in brackish water, allowing the study of the prey items in the gastric cavities at different time scales. The number of preys ingested is influenced by the ctenophores biovolume: from 8 prey ind-1 (0.5 mL) to 1 207 prey ind-1 (35 mL) and by temperature 3.4 degC (2 +- 2 prey ind-1) to 23.2 degC (517 +- 295 prey ind-1). The Gut Evacuation Time is strongly related to temperature and ranged from 80 min (25 degC) to 160 min (9 degC). Mnemiopsis leidyi diet changed seasonally following in situ concentrations of prey. The less mobile prey such as molluscs (33.7 +- 27.9 %) and barnacles (13.0 +- 13.2 %) were the most impacted. This predation on the zooplankton assemblage could lead at time to a release of grazing pressure on phytoplankton and favour the eutrophication of the lagoon.
