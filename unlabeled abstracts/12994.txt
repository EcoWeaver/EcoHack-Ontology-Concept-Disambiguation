Effects of the receiving assemblage and disturbance on the colonisation of an invasive species
While the consequences of bioinvasions are becoming clearer, our understanding of the environmental and ecological factors driving them is limited due to the complexity of the invasion process. Invasion success can be considered to be influenced by characteristics of the receiving assemblage (habitat, food, community interactions) and disturbances. Studies on the effects of the receiving assemblage have typically focused on a single or small subset of species, rather than on complex, multitrophic assemblages. We used an experimental assemblage consisting of more than 30 taxa from multiple trophic levels to evaluate the importance of the presence of this community and disturbance on colonisation by a generalist invader. To achieve this, we compared colonisation between a disturbed and undisturbed community. In addition, we evaluated the effects of the presence of organic matter of a different source (simulating a disturbance event affecting different habitats) on colonisation. A model generalist invader, the isopod Cirolana harfordi, was introduced to patches of oyster beds with (1) undisturbed (live) assemblages, (2) disturbed assemblages, (3) organic matter (using organic matter of a different source), or (4) no assemblage or organic matter. Our results indicated that the presence of an assemblage (disturbed or not) fostered colonisation; however, colonisation was less successful when the assemblage was undisturbed. Results also indicate that for a disturbance event to affect the colonisation of C. harfordi, it has to directly affect the invaded assemblage. These results add to the understanding of the factors driving invasions, which is important to design management strategies.
