Muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) decline after the expansion of American mink (Neovison vison) in Poland
Field survey data in Central Poland revealed that the proportion of sites inhabited by muskrats decreased from 44% to 7% over one decade. This corresponded to the decline in hunting bags of muskrat over the whole of Poland. The largest hunting harvest of muskrat was recorded in 1987/1988 (66,416 individuals), the smallest in 2007/2008 (4,567 individuals). The decline in hunting bags occurred in all regions analysed; however, it was most rapid in the north and north-east. Before the expansion of mink, which started in northern Poland at the beginning of the 1980s, muskrat densities in particular regions depended on the availability of aquatic habitats. A comparison of hunting bags of muskrat and American mink in years 2002-2008 indicated a significant negative correlation between the numbers of these two species harvested in seven regions of Poland. The negative correlation between numbers of muskrat and mink suggests that mink predation is one of the most important factors in the decline of the muskrat population in Poland.
