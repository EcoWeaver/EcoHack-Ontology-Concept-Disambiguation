The invasion of Macrobrachium nipponense (de Haan, 1849) (Caridea: Palaemonidae) into the Southern Iraqi Marshes
Forty-two specimens of Macrobrachium nipponense (de Haan, 1849) were collected from Abu-Zirig Marsh in the south of Iraq, in July 2005. DNA sequences confirmed the morphological identification by 99 % similarity to published 16S sequences. The introduction vector for this non-native species into the wild is considered to be unintentional escapes from Iranian aquaculture.
