Water balance in the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) compared with five common native ant species from southern California
Abstract Little attention has been given to the effect of physiological limitations on the ability of introduced species to invade ecological communities. In the present study, the water balance of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) is compared with five common ant species native to southern California. Total and critical water contents are measured, as well as rates of water loss and survival times. The results show that the body size of ant species has a strong effect on water balance, explaining between 99% of total and 90% of critical water content (i.e. the amount of water remaining when the ant becomes moribund). The measured survival times at 40 degC and approximately 0% relative humidity are shorter for L. humile than for the other five native ant species. The area-independent water-loss rate is higher for L. humile than for the other native ant species studied. This finding is corroborated by independent data using two different methods (i.e. gravimetric measurement and open-flow respirometry). Somewhat surprisingly, significant differences in the water-loss rates of different sizes of Solenopsis xyloni workers are found, even after adjusting for surface area. The area-independent water-loss rate is significantly lower for larger than for smaller workers. Consistent with circumstantial evidence from the field, the results suggest that the physiological constraints of invasive species, such as water-loss rates and critical water content, can limit their distribution and abundance not only at regional scales, but also at fine scales.
