Influence of six essential oils on invasive Solidago canadensis L. seed germination
Solidago canadensis L. (SC) (Canadian goldenrod) is a dangerous plant invader in Europe, which suppress the indigenous flora. Essential oils (EOs) are considered biological control agents. GC-MS analysis for identification of main components was conducted and the potential phytotoxicity of six EOs were also evaluated. Limonene and b-thujone were dominant components in Salvia officinalis L., menthone and menthol in Mentha x piperita L., carvacrol in Origanum vulgare L., estragole/anisole and anethole in Foeniculum vulgare Mill., limonene and carvone in Anethum graveolens L., and anethole in Pimpinella anisum L. Along with EOs, anethole, anisole, camphor, carvone, estragole, limonene, menthol, menthone, thujone and thymol were used independently to evaluate phytotoxic effect against Canadian goldenrod seed germination. A significant inhibitory effect was registered for origanum (1.250 ug.ml-1). The influence of single components was significant. The highest phytotoxic activity was registered with anethole and estragole. Phenolic compounds were the inhibitoriest, followed by oxygenated and hydrocarbon monoterpenes.
