Preventing the Spread of Aquatic Invasive Species: Boater Concerns, Habits, and Future Behaviors
This article examined the role of value orientations and attitudes toward aquatic invasive species (AIS) on responsible boating behavior to reduce the likelihood of spreading AIS. Mitigation strategies developed to prevent the spread of AIS are most successful when the determinants of boating behaviors are well understood. Data were collected using a self-administered mail survey of a regionally stratified random sample of registered boaters in Illinois. Results provided support for the distinction of attitude into affective and behavioral components. While value orientations were significant predictors of environmental concern and past responsible environmental behavior, these attitude components were good predictors of intentions for future responsible boating behavior. Identifying the most influential predictors of responsible boating behaviors will help resource managers design effective intervention strategies to prevent AIS spread.
