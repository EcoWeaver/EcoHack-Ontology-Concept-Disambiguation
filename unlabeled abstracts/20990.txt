Biosecurity and sustainability within the growing global bioeconomy
Research highlights > Development of the global bioeconomy and associated new non-food crops requires consideration of their potential to escape and cause environmental harm. > Introducing new crops requires risk-benefit-cost decision-making and science-based policy to capture benefits and avoid long-term risks and potential clean-up costs. > New cropping systems require integrated pest management practices relevant to multiuse landscapes in the context of existing production systems and future climates.
