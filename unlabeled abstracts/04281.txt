Programmed Allee effect in bacteria causes a tradeoff between population spread and survival
Significance Understanding how species spread and survive is important in many biological contexts. The ability to disperse has been shown to enhance spread in some species but detract in others. Theoretical studies have predicted that these observations may be due to the Allee effect. To test this theory, we engineered Escherichia coli to have an Allee effect. Using these bacteria, we found that if dispersal is too fast or too slow, a population cannot spread. By manipulating the number of patches, we uncovered tradeoffs that control spread and survival. Finally, we demonstrate that fluctuations in growth may serve to determine if spread occurs. Our results may be useful in controlling invasive species and the spread of infectious diseases.
