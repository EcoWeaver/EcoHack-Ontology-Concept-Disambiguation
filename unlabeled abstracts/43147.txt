Impact of an alien invasive plant <i>Amaranthus retroflexus</i> on wetland sediment properties under two growth stages
It is meaningful to investigate the impact of alien invasive plants on wetland sediment. Field experiments were conducted to study the impact of the alien invasive plant, Amaranthus retroflexus, on wetland sediment properties under two growth stages. The results showed that growth of A. retroflexus tended to increase moisture content, porosity, and could significantly decrease total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate (N-NO3-) concentrations in sediment and ammonium (N-NH4+) concentration in interstitial water (p < 0.05). However, no obvious impact was observed on total phosphorus (TP) nor on N-NH4+ concentrations in sediment. There was a difference in impact of A. retroflexus on sediment properties under two growth stages. The plants with a longer growth stage significantly decreased loss on ignition in sediment and P-PO43- concentration in interstitial water. There were also significant differences in N-NH4+ concentration in both sediment and interstitial water over the vertical profile of the plant. In the plant treatment with a longer growth stage, P-PO43- concentration also showed significant differences over the vertical profile. Therefore, the growth of A. retroflexus can improve sediment physical and chemical properties, reducing N-NH4+ and P-PO43- release from sediment to overlying water to some extent, thereby decreasing sediment nutrient loading.
