Water clearance efficiency indicates potential filter-feeding interactions between invasive Sinanodonta woodiana and native freshwater mussels
The Chinese pond mussel (Sinanodonta woodiana Lea, 1834) is a benthic filter-feeder that prefers soft-bottomed freshwater habitats and has successfully spread into both tropical and temperate water bodies outside its natural Southeast Asian range. Due to its preference for nutrient-rich waters with high levels of suspended food particles, the capacity of S. woodiana to influence natural seston concentrations is thought to be relatively low in comparison to that of other invasive bivalves. The experimental quantification of seston removal efficiency reported here demonstrates that S. woodiana is able to reduce seston loads to levels comparable to those by the control native freshwater mussel species Unio tumidus Philipsson, 1788. Moreover, increasing food depletion did not cause detectable changes in the filtration regime of S. woodiana, although the activity of native U. tumidus was significantly reduced. The seston clearance rate (volume of water cleared of particles per unit time) of S. woodiana averaged 9.3 +- 4.0 mL g-1 wet mass h-1, which corresponds to the total daily volume of water filtered being up to several hundreds to thousands L m-2 at the maximal S. woodiana population densities reported in the literature. The observed filtration capacity of S. woodiana and its current invasional spread into areas inhabited by endangered freshwater mussels call for more careful consideration of filter-feeding interactions with native mussels. The potential impacts of S. woodiana should be studied in more detail with respect to available food resources and long-term nutritional needs of native species and reflected in management strategies in the invaded range.
