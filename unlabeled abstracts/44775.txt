Seasonal variations alter the effect of an invasive plant on the decomposition of a native plant in a subtropical eutrophic lake, China
To assess how the presence of an invasive plant and different-sized decomposers affect plant litter decomposition under different seasonal conditions, we allocated leaves of native Ficus virens Aiton into four different mesh sizes (0.025, 0.042, 0.5 and 5 mm) with and without invasive Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb. We incubated them for 65 days in an eutrophic lake in summer and winter respectively. The average decomposition rate was significantly higher in summer than in winter, and was significantly higher in mixtures than in F. virens monocultures in both seasons. The presence of A. philoxeroides in the mixture significantly increased invertebrate density and microbial respiration rates in summer but not in winter. Furthermore, contribution of invertebrates to decomposition was higher in the early stage of decomposition and lower in the late stage in summer, yet that of microbes was relatively constant in winter. Contribution of microinvertebrates increased in summer but that of meio-, macroinvertebrates increased in winter. Our findings indicate that the presence of an invasive plant altered litter decomposition, which may depend on seasonal variations, invertebrate density and decomposition stages.
