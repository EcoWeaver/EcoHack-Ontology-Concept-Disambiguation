Conservation and restoration of plant-animal mutualisms on oceanic islands
a b s t r a c t Islands harbour much of the world's threatened biodiversity. Recent work has highlighted how it is not species diversity per se but rather the interactions between organisms that breathes life into ecosystems. Thus, the real challenge to preserving and restoring biodiversity on islands is not to only focus on species themselves, but more importantly on maintaining and restoring the integrity of interactions between the species. Here we argue that mutualistic plant-animal interactions play a pivotal role with regards to conservation and restoration on islands. Furthermore, these interactions are ideally suited for inter-island comparisons due to ecological and evolutionary similarities across geographical and taxonomical boundaries. The similarities include highly generalised mutualistic systems, the evolution and readjustment of plant reproductive traits, and a disharmony in taxonomic groups of mutualists, compared to continental ecosystems. We highlight past and present threats to island plant-animal mutualisms, as well as the challenges and opportunities inherent to these interactions. In particular, we (1) argue that mutualistic networks provide an ideal approach to collect information and advance our knowledge on the systems, (2) suggest the use of interactions as biodiversity monitoring and assessment tools, (3) highlight the differences and similarities between pollination and seed dispersal interactions in the context of restoration, and (4) briefly discuss the ambiguous role of alien invasive species in the management of mutualistic interactions. Finally, we highlight how a recently proposed but controversial restoration strategy, rewilding, can be gainfully applied to and further advanced in island settings.
