Antifungal activity of some invasive alien plant leaf extracts against mango (Mangifera indica)anthracnose caused byColletotrichum gloeosporioides
The antifungal activity of five invasive alien plant leaf extracts against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was studied in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro antifungal activity was based on the inhibitory effects of the extracts on C. gloeosporioides radial growth and conidia formation, while the in vivo activity was based on the development of anthracnose disease on detached mango fruits. For the in vivo test, two plant extracts that showed higher inhibitory effect in vitro were selected and their minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and tested against the disease on detached mango fruits applying the extracts at three times of application. The study revealed that the inhibitory effect of the extracts depends on the type of plant species used, method of extraction and time of application of the extracts. Prosopis juliflora and Lantana camara extracts were the most effective plant extracts that significantly reduced radial growth and conidia formation, and reduced disease development on mango fruits. Thus, P. juliflora and L. camara extracts can serve as an alternative means of post-harvest mango anthracnose disease management.
