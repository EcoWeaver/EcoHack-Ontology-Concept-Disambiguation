Reproductive parameters of topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva) from a heated Lake Lichenskie (Poland)
Abstract Temperature regime is known to have considerable influence on the life-histories of fish. Topmouth gudgeon is a very successful invader with high biological flexibility and phenotypic plasticity. The flexibility of topmouth gudgeon in a normal thermal regime has been well described, however there has been no information published about how it would cope with extreme conditions, e.g. permanently heated water. Several studies have demonstrated that phenotypic plasticity provides an important advantage to invasive species. To explain their invasion success, the theory of alternative ontogenies and invasive potential has been proposed. The aim of the present study was to examine if the reproductive parameters of a population living in permanently heated water differ from those living in habitats with a normal temperature regime, as well as to test a hypothesis derived from the theory of alternative ontogenies and invasive potential. Over a period of 8 years (2004-2011), a high variation in the reproductive parameters of topmouth gudgeon from Lake Lichenskie was found. With a small exception, all the observed results met the expectations predicted by the hypothesis tested. This indicates that topmouth gudgeon retains high phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits even in a habitat with extreme conditions, which is important for the species' invasion success.
