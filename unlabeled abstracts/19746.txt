The signal crayfish is not a single species: cryptic diversity and invasions in the Pacific Northwest range of Pacifastacus leniusculus
1. We used historical sources, morphology-based taxonomy and mtDNA sequence data to address questions about the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus. These included evaluating unrecognised cryptic diversity and investigating the extent to which P. leniusculus may have been introduced within its presumed native range in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Our study builds and expands on Pacific Northwest phylogeographic knowledge, particularly related to patterns of glacial refugia for freshwater species.
