Biology ofPolypedilumn. sp. (Diptera: Chironomidae), a promising candidate agent for the biological control of the aquatic weedLagarosiphon major(Hydrocharitaceae) in Ireland
Lagarosiphon major (Ridl.) Moss ex Wager (Hydrocharitaceae), an aquatic macrophyte native to Southern Africa that has become invasive in several countries worldwide, is a potential target for biological control. Biology studies were conducted on Polypedilum (Pentapedilum) n. sp. near reei Oyewo & Saether (Diptera: Chironomidae), a midge whose larvae were discovered mining the plant's shoot tips in its native range. Field surveys indicated that the midge occurred only at a small number of sites but attained high densities (up to 370 shoots damaged/m2) that prevented further growth from the shoot tips. A population of the midge was imported into quarantine in Ireland to evaluate its potential as a candidate biological control agent. The adult stage is terrestrial and short-lived (4-5 d), with females depositing one-two egg packets into the water bodies. First-instar larvae fed externally on the stems and leaflets. Later instars fed on the apical meristems and burrowed into the shoot tips, with resultant damage stunting the apical growth. Larvae moved readily between shoots to complete their development and pupated within the tunnels excavated by the late instar larvae. Developmental time to adulthood ranged from 31 to 49 days at 20.7degC and a 15 L:9-D cycle. This is the first time that a chironomid has been imported and successfully cultured for consideration as a classical biological control agent. Several aspects of the midge's biology suggest that host specificity testing is warranted to determine its potential as a biocontrol agent of L. major.
