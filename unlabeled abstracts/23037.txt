The distribution of Obolodiplosis robiniae on black locust in Slovakia
For the first time during October 2006, the occurrence of Obolodiplosis robiniae (Haldeman 1847) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) was recorded on the black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) in Slovakia. During 2007, field surveys were undertaken to determine the distribution of the species and the infestation ratio at different locations. One year after its first discovery, O. robiniae was found throughout southern Slovakia. The gall midge was observed in 148 out of 161 checked locations. The infestation ratio of single leaves varied from 4 to 100%. The infestation ratio of the black locust tree was evaluated during May-June, July-August, and September-October, and accounted for 15-39, 9-53, and 6-49%, respectively. The most frequent infestation ratio fluctuated from 10 to 30% (115 locations). The highest infestation was recorded during July-August. Greater infestation was prevalent in the larger settlements than it was in the countryside. The gall midge was also recorded on R. viscosa Vent. Although the results show that O. robiniae is nowadays an usual insect with high potential to become an important pest of ornamental black locust or biological control agent against weedy black locust in southern Slovakia, the species do not appear to have reached pest status until now.
