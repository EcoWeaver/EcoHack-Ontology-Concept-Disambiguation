An experimental study of the relative humidity preference and survival of the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Hymenoptera, Formicidae): comparisons with a native Iridomyrmex species in South Australia
The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), is a widespread invasive ant species that commonly displaces native ants and other ground-dwelling invertebrates in its introduced range. Previous studies have documented a relationship between the spread of Argentine ants and abiotic conditions (particularly water availability) in invaded areas, suggesting that the invasion success of Argentine ants may be related to specific abiotic factors. This study describes the relative humidity preferences and survival of Argentine ants and a dominant native ant, Iridomyrmex 'rufoniger' sp. group, in the laboratory. In a preference experiment, Argentine ant workers showed a significantly greater propensity than Iridomyrmex to locate themselves in containers with the highest relative humidity. A series of survival trials revealed that the survival of both species was related to the relative humidities within experimental containers. The survival of Argentine ant colonies was reduced in comparison with those of Iridomyrmex sp. after 4 h, however by 24 h both species displayed similar levels of survival in all relative humidity conditions. These findings confirm a relationship between the level of available moisture and the distribution and survival of Argentine ants, and may help to account for the current distribution and invasion success of Argentine ants in Australia.
