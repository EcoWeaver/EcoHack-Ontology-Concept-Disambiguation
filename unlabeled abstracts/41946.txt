Germination biology of the exotic ice cream bean (Inga edulis Mart.) seed from Bedugul, Bali
Abstract Inga edulis is an exotic edible Fabaceae species locally known as buah es krim in Bedugul, Bali. The plant species is a favourite fruit for consumption and trading due to the sweet sarcostesta. Wild I. edulis are abundantly grown in Bedugul. The current study aim is to describes I. edulis germination biology. This study will provide data for I. edulis future research both in its domestication and invasion prevention. I. edulis seeds are collected two times from wild plants growing within Bali Botanic Garden. A total of twenty-one I. edulis seeds are germinated in a clear closed plastic container with agar media at Bali Botanic Garden Seed Bank Laboratory. The germination process was observed daily until the seventh day after sowing (DAS) while number of seedlings was calculated in the last observation day. Quantitative and qualitative data analysis was conducted to describe I. edulis seed germination biology. This study result shows that I. edulis seeds produce high germination percentage rapidly. I. edulis seeds exhibited hypogeal germination and phanerocotylar hypogeal with reserve storage seedling functional type. Polyembryony was also present with a single seed can produce up to four seedlings.
