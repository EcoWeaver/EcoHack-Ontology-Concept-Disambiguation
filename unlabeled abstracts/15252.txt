Plant ecology. Alien invaders.
There are plenty of examples of the ecological mayhem that can result from the human introduction of species into new areas. Stories of goats on Pacific islands, rabbits in Australia and rats in New Zealand are all familiar, as are the world's plant pests, from the aquatic weeds of tropical waterways to the nitrogen-fixing shrubs of Hawaii. The ecological repercussions of plant invasions are often far-reaching, and a fuller understanding of the complexities of ecosystem relationships may provide methods for the control of invasive species. These principles are illustrated by papers in the journals Conservation Biology and Journal of Applied Ecology. The first deals with the impact of invasive shrubs on songbird breeding success in North America1; the second with the potential control of unwanted grasses on golf courses in Britain2.
