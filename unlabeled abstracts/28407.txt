Seasonal variation in the size and abundance of the invading Bythotrephes in Harp Lake, Ontario, Canada
Bythotrephes invaded Harp Lake, Ontario, Canada, in the early 1990s. Here we describe seasonal changes in the size, abundance and life history of the invader. The weight of Bythotrephes could be accurately estimated (r2 =0.90) from the length of its body and the state of development of its brood, but substantial (22%) corrections for shrinkage in sugarformalin were required. The seasonality of the size and abundance of Bythotrephes was apparently regulated by the interaction of fish predation, temperature-mediated growth, the availability of the invader''s prey, and switches in its reproductive biology. The vernal increase in the growth of the Bythotrephes population lagged behind increases in water temperature and abundances of preferred prey, most probably because of predation by lake herring (Coregonus artedi). Bythotrephes abundance increased rapidly in early July; however, the population maximum was brief. After the abundance of their preferred prey crashed in mid-July, Bythotrephes body size declined, and adult females switched from parthenogenic to resting egg production. Population size declined in consequence. In the summer, female Bythotrephes committed most of their energy to growth between instar I and II, but to egg production for instars II and III. The biology of the Harp Lake population differed from that observed in other recently invaded lakes in several ways - the lag in population growth in the spring, the small change in body size between instars II and III, the decline in body size in August, and the co-incident switch by mature females to resting egg production. These inter-lake differences in biology indicate we have more to learn about Bythotrephes before we can predict its influence on the inland lakes of North America.
