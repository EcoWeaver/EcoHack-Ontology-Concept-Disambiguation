Pseudonereis anomala (Polychaeta, Nereididae) expands its range westward: first Italian record in Augusta and Siracusa harbours
A total of 42 individuals of the non-indigenous polychaete Pseudonereis anomala are reported for the first time along the Ionian coast of Italy. Sampling was carried out by SCUBA diving in summer 2013 on hard substrates by scraping quadrates of a 20 x 20 cm2 surface in the Sicilian harbours of Augusta and Siracusa. The maximum density and biomass values measured for the species in the studied area were 225 ind./m2 and 3.038 g/m2, respectively, in Augusta harbour.
