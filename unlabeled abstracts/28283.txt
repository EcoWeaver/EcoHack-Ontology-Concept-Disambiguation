A catalogue of non-native weeds in irrigated crops in Sardinia (Italy)
Arable land and agro-ecosystems are human-made habitats with a high representation of non-native species and with specific disturbance regimens. In agro-ecosystems, in particular, non-native species have a tangible economic impact through crop yield losses. The available literature on non-native plant species in irrigated crops in Sardinia was examined and field surveys were made to verify the presence and persistence of the alien weeds hitherto reported and to detect the presence of newcomers. An comprehensive updated inventory of Sardinian non-native weed flora in irrigated crops, including accepted names, family, synonyms, biological form, type of fruit and region of origin and classified according to their time of introduction and invasive status in the island, is provided. A total number of 129 species are listed with one new record for the island. The irrigated crops in Sardinia are significantly rich in non-native invasive entities and this type of land-use represents an important reservoir of non-native species and pathways of introduction of new weeds and therefore should be constantly monitored.
