Froelichia (Amaranthaceae) -- a new generic record and invasive weed for Africa
Froelichia (Amaranthaceae) is reported from the Sahel of Senegal for the first time. This is a new generic record for Africa and is a cause for concern since the genus is known to be an invasive weed in other countries with warm climates and sandy substrates. The difficulties caused by this taxon are summarised and control measures are suggested.
