Supplementary notes to the flora of Cyprus VIII
Continuing a series of miscellaneous contributions by various authors, the eighth and final instalment includes information on 104 taxa focussing on the taxonomy, chorology and ecology of the Cyprus flora. Two new combinations, Allium cyprium subsp. lefkarense and Myosotis paucipilosa, are validated. Fifteen taxa are new to the island, e.g. the indigenous species Alcea acaulis, Atriplex davisii, Euphorbia berythea, Rumex crispus and the aliens Cirsium arvense and Sisymbrium altissimum. Chromosome numbers are given for 22 taxa. Many of them are first counts of Cypriot material. Counts for Arenaria pamphylica subsp. kyrenica, Bosea cypria, Campanula podocarpa, Hirtellina lobelii, Noccaea cypria, Phlomis brevibracteata and probably Salvia dominica seem to be the first ever for these taxa.
