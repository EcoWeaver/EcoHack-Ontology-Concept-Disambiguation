Conchas crayfish (Orconectes deanae) recognized as an alien species in the Middle Rio Grande Basin, New Mexico
We document the conchas crayfish (Orconectes deanae) as another introduced crayfish in the middle Rio Grande. We collected O. deanae in the Rio Grande and its associated ditches between Belen and La Joya, New Mexico. We did not collect O. deanae from the adjacent Pecos River; further sampling is necessary to determine the full range and impact of this alien species in the Rio Grande drainage.
