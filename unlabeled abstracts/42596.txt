Chromosome numbers of invasive species of the Altai Republic flora: post 1
Chromosome numbers (2n) of 13 invasive species of the Altai Republic from Asteraceae, Boraginaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, and Plantaginaceae are reported. For Myosotis sparsiflora Mikan ex Pohl. (2n = 18) and Sisymbrium officinale (L.) Scop. (2n = 14) chromosome complements were examined for the first time on the material from Russia; for Centaurea jacea L. (2n = 44), Pilosella officinarum F. W. Schultz et Sch. Bip. (2n = 45), Galega orientalis Lam. (2n = 16), and Leonurus japonicus Houtt. (2n = 20) - from Siberia. The most species are diploids. Three species (Leonurus japonicus, Pilosella officinarum, and Plantago lanceolata L.) have additional aneuploid mixoploid cells. The general distribution and the history of floristic findings of examined species in the Altai Republic were given. The data on chromosome numbers published earlier on the material from Russia are cited.
