Adaptation of native syrphid flies to new exotic plant (Impatiens spp.)-aphidant associations in Central Europe (Dipt., Syrphidae; Hom., Aphididae; Hym., Formicidae)
Impatiens parviflora andI. glandulifera, two invasive touchme-not species of exotic origin were found to be associated with two aphid groups in Central Europe: a) Exotic species subsequently following their invasive plant hosts (Impatientinum asiaticum Nevsky), b) native species secondarily adapted to the new exotic hosts (Aphis fabae cirsiiacanthoidis Scop.). The species number (listed) of associated syrphid flies in the newly developed guilds was rather high, consisting of broadly oligophagous species. The plant phenology and adaptation of the aphids have resulted in associations which apparently represent seasonally significant sources of prey, their importance apparently increasing with the decreasing season. Antattendance was determined in both aphid species, and no adverse interference with the preying syrphid larvae was observed. In spite of an overall classification of the target plants as expansive weeds, they are classified positively as contributing to the enhancement of syrphid fly populations in the biocorridors in the cultivated landscape.
