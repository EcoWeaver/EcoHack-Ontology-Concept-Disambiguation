Winter bird gets the worm: consumption of earthworms (Lumbricidae) by striated caracaras (Phalcoboenus australis) in invasive Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus) in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)
Biological invasions can drive ecosystem change and alter predator ecology by providing trophic subsidies that mitigate the effects of seasonally pulsed resources. Striated Caracaras (Phalcoboenus australis) are near threatened, non-migratory falconids who inhabit the southern coasts of South America and the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) and feed on seasonally migratory colonial seabirds. Here we report the first multi-day observation of caracaras foraging extensively for earthworms (Lumbricidae) and beetle larvae (Coleoptera) in introduced Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus) on New Island, Falkland Islands. Our results suggest that invertebrates may be a more important winter resource than previously thought, and that caracaras benefit indirectly from introduced grasses in the Falklands, a relationship that merits special consideration when identifying ecological restoration plans.
