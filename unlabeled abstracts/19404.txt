Altered Plant-community Composition and Edaphic Features Associated with Plowing in Southern Wisconsin Fens
The potential for land-use legacies to alter current wetland macrophyte communities and edaphic conditions are underexplored. Here we present results of a study describing associations among these factors in southern Wisconsin fens. Plant-community composition, hydrology, and nutrient availability data were recorded from 1) fens that had been plowed, 2) fens that have never been plowed, and 3) fens with plowed and never-plowed areas. Plowed fens had: 1) lower total species richness, 2) higher invasive species richness, 2) lower native graminoid richness, 3) lower shrub richness, 4) lower root-zone volumetric water content, and 5) higher available N and P then never-plowed fens. Most of these same relationships held when comparing plowed and never-plowed areas of the same fen. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling revealed that the most important community gradient separates graminoid- and fen-specialist-rich communities from those dominated by invasive species. This gradient also separated plowed from never plowed plots. Accordingly, we believe that a history of plowing has fundamentally altered biotic and, potentially, abiotic conditions, with real consequences for wetland management and restoration.
