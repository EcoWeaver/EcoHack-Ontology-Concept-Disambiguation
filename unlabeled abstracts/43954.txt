Invasive shrub alters native forest amphibian communities
Although invasive plants can have transformative effects on native plant communities, studies of the consequences of plant invasion for native fauna are generally restricted to primary consumers. Here we investigate whether an invasive shrub, Lonicera maackii, impacts native amphibians and evaluate evi- dence for the role of invasive plant-induced alteration of forest understory microclimate as a mechanism driving amphibian responses to L. maackii invasion. We sampled amphibian communities in forest plots with high or low density of L. maackii, and monitored microclimate (temperature and humidity at ground level) in the same forest plots. Amphibian species richness and evenness were lower in invaded plots. Invasion also resulted in shifts in amphibian species composition. Mean daily maximum temperature and mean daily temperature were lower in invaded plots, and counts of the Green frog Lithobates clam- itans were marginally negatively related to mean daily temperature. Our work illustrates how an invasive ecosystem engineer may affect native organisms with which it shares no trophic connection, and sug- gests that changes in microclimate may be one mechanism by which alien plants affect communities where they invade.
