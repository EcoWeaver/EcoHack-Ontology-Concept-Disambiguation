Plasticity responses of an invasive macrophyte species to inorganic carbon availability and to the interaction with a native species
Climatic changes predict alteration in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in freshwater ecosystems. However, the responses of invasive submerged macrophytes to DIC are rarely assessed. We evaluated the phenotypic plasticity of the invasive macrophyte Hydrilla verticillata in response to DIC, and how the presence of a native, Egeria najas, influences plasticity. Both species grew under three DIC levels in monocultures and mixed cultures. In monocultures, H. verticillata's Relative Growth Rates (RGR) was higher than E. najas's RGR in most treatments and increasing DIC lead to faster RGR for H. verticillata, evidencing its superior performance at higher DIC levels. In mixed cultures, H. verticillata grew faster in all treatments. We also found a larger number of branches of H. verticillata in both types of cultures, evidencing greater dispersal ability with increasing DIC. In conclusion, higher H. verticillata RGR with increasing DIC indicates that this species exhibited greater plasticity to carbon availability than the native species, which can partially explain its invasion success in ecosystems around the world. Our results also suggest that H. verticillata will benefit from increasing DIC in freshwater ecosystems.
