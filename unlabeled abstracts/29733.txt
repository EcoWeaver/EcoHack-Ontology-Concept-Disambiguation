Different susceptibility of indigenous populations of Lymantria dispar to the exotic entomopathogen Entomophaga maimaiga
The recovery of the host-specific entomopathogen Entomophaga maimaiga is still limited to certain world areas, although it is recently spreading to Eastern Europe. This study evaluated the effectiveness and fitness of an E. maimaiga isolate from Balkans against Lymantria dispar populations collected along the Italian peninsula and main islands, where the fungus has never been reported. As a result of different bioassays, the pathogenicity against gypsy moth larvae was generally confirmed, although significant differences among insects feeding upon diverse forest plant species were observed. The lack of significant susceptibility of other lepidopteran species from the same areas is also reported.
