The barnaclesChirona(Striatobalanus)amaryllis(Darwin 1854) andMegabalanus coccopoma(Darwin 1854) (Crustacea, Cirripedia): two invasive species new to tropical West African waters
The collection of the barnacle Chirona (Striatobalanus) amaryllis (Darwin 1954) (Crustacea, Cirripedia) from the hull of a ship that had been operating for five months in the Gulf of Guinea and off Sierra Leone triggered a closer investigation of the cirriped fauna of the West African coast. Both C. amaryllis and Megabalanus coccopoma can now be added to the list of successful invasions in tropical West African waters. This discovery, as well as the circumstances of the findings, necessitates an update of the invertebrate faunal inventory of tropical West African marine waters.
