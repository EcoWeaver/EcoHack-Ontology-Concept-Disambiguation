Trophic ecology of the European wild rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus on the Mediterranean island of Lemnos, Greece
The European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a species with a wide distribution across the globe and a contradicting role in the ecological integrity of ecosystems and local economies. Despite the considerable amount of research that has been conducted on the trophic ecology of the species in continental environments, similar studies in insular environments are still fairly scarce. The article examines the trophic ecology of wild rabbit, using microhistological analysis to study its annual dietary composition in relation to the availability and quality of food sources, in two different habitats of a northeast Mediterranean island. A total of 112 species were found to participate, to a lower or greater degree, in the species diet across the year. The available food sources, as well as the identified food items, were classified in three feeding functional groups (FFGs), namely, grasses, forbs and parts of woody plants. Wild rabbit follows a diverse diet having adapted to the seasonal changes in the availability and quality of food sources. Forbs is the FFG which constitutes the main food source of the species, while grasses and parts of woody plants form occasionally an important component of its diet. The FFG of grasses is almost constantly preferred in both habitat types and plays a deterministic role in the trophic ecology of wild rabbit. During the critical dry season, where the availability of high quality food becomes limited, the species preferably consumes taxa that are generally less palatable and even toxic in its struggle for survival.
