Effect of Aqueous Leaf Leachate of Anthemis cotula- An Alien Invasive Species on Germination Behaviour of Some Field Crops
Leaf leachate of Anthemis cotula inhibits seed germination of the commonly cultivated field crops in Kashmir valley. Among the four indices of germination (GT, S, AS, CRG), S (speed of germination) and AS (speed of accumulated germination) are sensitive enough to establish the allelopathic activity of the leaf leachate. Inhibition of seed/grain germination of the field crops showed a species-specific and dose-dependent response with highest inhibition occurring at 5000 ppm concentration. Brassica campestris seeds are most sensitive, whereas those of Vigna radiata are least sensitive. Interestingly, achene germination of A. cotula is promoted by its own leachate at low concentrations and inhibited at high concentrations.
