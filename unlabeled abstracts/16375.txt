All ecosystems look messy, but some more so than others: A case-study on the management and acceptance of Mediterranean urban grasslands
The spontaneous revegetation of a disused demolition waste landfill in Rome (Italy) led to a very high vascular plant species density (269 species in 0.2 km2). Vegetation was dominated by Mediterranean annual species (Therophytes), and floristic assemblage was consistent with the regional species pool. No significant levels of biotic homogenization were found. Local activists successfully campaigned to save the site from development, which resulted in its designation as an Urban Nature Reserve; however, it was essentially managed as a conventional neighbourhood park. As a consequence, vascular plant species richness decreased by 50%. The functional and biogeographic groups most typical of Mediterranean habitats saw the largest decrease (the steno-Mediterranean element decreased by 80%), leading to biotic homogenization via changes in native species only (no increases in alien species were observed). The removal of most of the old demolition-waste mounds was probably the main cause for these observed changes. These mounds provide well-drained, oligotrophic soils and micro-habitat heterogeneity.
