Peroxidase as a metric of stress tolerance and invasive potential of alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) growing in aquatic habitats
An attempt was made to understand the potential of Alternanthera philoxeroides, alligator weed to adapt to diverse conditions present in pond ecosystems, through a correlative investigation of its natural growth pattern and peroxidase level. Eleven ponds were graded into twosubjective categories: "A. philoxeroides Infestation" (High, Medium, Low) and "Level of Pollution" (High and Low), to test for difference in mean peroxidase concentration in A. philoxeroides populations. Significant changes in mean peroxidase concentration in A. philoxeroides were found in ponds categorized on the basis of level of pollution, indicating the adaptability of this plant to propagate under pollution stress.On the other hand, there was no significant change in mean peroxidase concentration for plants growing in ponds categorized on the basis ofinfestation showed that dense, vegetative proliferation caused no stress in A. philoxeroides. An efficient method of assaying peroxidase in A. philoxeroides, under field conditions, using the best suited leaf group (Tips, Tips + 1st leaf pair", 2nd leaf pair) was also explored. "Tips + 1st leaf pair" proved to be a better sample than mature leaves for estimation of peroxidase concentration in A. philoxeroides.
