A Biological Analysis on the Invasiveness of the Corbicula Fluminea
Corbicula fluminea is an invasive species that has been observed to outcompete the native clams at the American River located near Sacramento in the Central Valley in California. We hypothesized that C. Fluminea has advantages exhibited physically including utilization of filter-feeding methods and relative spacing of its cirri as compared to the native American River clams. To investigate what makes the species so successful, we tested C. Fluminea versus the native clams in algal and E. coli environments to predict the relative advantage of a filter feeder. In addition, we used computer programs to digitally analyze the spacing between the actual cirri, which help bivalves capture food particles, of the two species. The findings pointed towards C. Fluminea's inherent advantage in both physical and genetic traits over the native clams species which allowed it to flourish and successfully invade the American River ecosystem. However, the species' genetic findings are found through DNA analysis.
