Global parasite trafficking: Asian Gyrodactylus (Monogenea) arrived to the U.S.A. via invasive fish Misgurnus anguillicaudatus as a threat to amphibians
A monogenean flatworm Gyrodactylus jennyae Paetow, Cone, Huyse, McLaughlin & Marcogliese, 2009 was previously described as a pathogen on bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus Shaw, 1802, in a Canadian captive population originating in Missouri, U.S.A. The ITS barcoding of G. jennyae showed relatedness to Asian Gyrodactylus macracanthus Hukuda 1940, a parasite of the Asian loach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus Cantor, 1842. The resulting suggestion that the globally invasive pet-trade of fish may be a mechanism for arrival of Gyrodactylus species to North America provided the framework for the current study. The present study was undertaken following the discovery of two other species of Gyrodactylus in a population of illegally introduced M. anguillicaudatus in New York State. Here the invasion hypothesis was tested via DNA sequencing of the ITS of the two Gyrodactylus species obtained from M. anguillicaudatus from New York, termed Gyrodactylus sp. A and Gyrodactylus sp. B. Both Gyrodactylus sp. A and Gyrodactylus sp. B were closely related to G. jennyae and G. macracanthus, and all belong to a molecularly well-supported monophyletic Asian freshwater group. In conclusion, this invasive fish has trafficked at least three parasite species to the U.S.A., one of them also found on frog. This route from the Asian wetlands to other continents is similar to that of amphibian chytrid fungi of genus Batrachochytrium Longcore, Pessier & Nichols, 1999.
