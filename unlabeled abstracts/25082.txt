The Ants of the Juan Fernandez Islands: Genesis of an Invasive Fauna
A first study of the ants on the three main islands of the Juan Fernandez Archipelago (Chile) has revealed the presence of just three species, Hypoponera confinis, Linepithema humile, and Tetramorium bicarinatum, all widely distributed invasive species. Most notable among them is the Argentine ant, L. humile, an ecologically destructive species that has established several populations and appears to be expanding.
