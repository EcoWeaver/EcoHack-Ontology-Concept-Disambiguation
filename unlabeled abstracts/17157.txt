Lakewide dominance does not predict the potential for spread of dreissenids
In recent years, quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) have almost completely replaced zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in the Lower Great Lakes. As recreational boats are the main vector of spread for dreissenids in North America, this study examined whether lakes Erie and Ontario could still be sources for the spread of zebra mussels. In the summer-fall of 2010, the abundance of each species of Dreissena on 196 boats from 5 marinas in lakes Erie and Ontario was examined. Additional samples of Dreissena in 2010-2012 were collected in tributaries, bays, and in the upper littoral zones of these lakes. A total of 77 boats were fouled by Dreissena, and of those 61 were fouled by both species, 13 were fouled just by zebra mussels, and only 3 were fouled solely by quagga mussels. Although quagga mussels compose ~ 99% of dreissenids in eastern Lake Erie and in Lake Ontario, on boats at most marinas sampled, zebra mussels were usually more abundant and significantly larger than quagga mussels. Refugia for zebra mussels were found in bays, tributaries, and upper littoral zones with high wave activity. Thus, although quagga mussels are now more abundant than zebra mussels within the Lower Great Lakes, these waterbodies still have the potential to be a source for the spread of zebra mussels, and for some vectors, the propagule pressure from zebra mussels is likely greater than that from quagga mussels.
