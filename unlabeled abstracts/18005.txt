Relationship between distribution and bottom sediment of submerged macrophytes in the Seta River, Shiga Prefecture, Japan
The purpose of this study was to survey the distribution and habitat of submerged macrophytes in the Seta River outflow from Lake Biwa, Shiga Prefecture, Japan. To accomplish this, I instituted a field survey with sampling on January 2009. I collected nine submerged macrophyte species during the diving operation. Sample collection showed that submerged macrophytes flourished on both sides of the river but did not flourish in the central portion of the river. Alien species (Egeria densa and Elodea nuttallii) were collected on all survey lines, while domestic species (Ceratophyllum demersum, Myriophyllum spicatum, Hydrilla verticillata, Vallisneria biwaensis, Vallisneria denseserrulata, Potamogeton maackianus, and Potamogeton malaianus) were collected in large amounts on the survey lines near Lake Biwa. The dominant species in cohesive soil or fine soil was Egeria densa, while the dominant species in sand gravel was Potamogeton maackianus. Although Egeria densa was collected in sand gravel too, Potamogeton maackianus was not collected in cohesive soil or fine soil, which indicates that Egeria densa has high fertility and can survive in an oxygen-poor environment, while Potamogeton maackianus cannot survive in an oxygen-poor environment.
