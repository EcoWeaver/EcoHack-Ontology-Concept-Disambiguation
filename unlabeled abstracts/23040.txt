Tracing the invasion history of mealy plum aphid, Hyalopterus pruni (Hemiptera: Aphididae), in North America: a population genetics approach
Biological invasions are typically the outcome of complex patterns of introduction, establishment, and spread, and genetic methods are excellent tools to resolve such histories for non-native organisms. The mealy plum aphid, Hyalopterus pruni, is an invasive pest of dried plum in California. We examined nine microsatellite loci and DNA sequences from three mitochondrial genes (1,148bp) in populations throughout the native and invaded ranges of H. pruni to assess key invasion parameters, including geographic origins of invasive populations, number of introductions, and levels of genetic diversity and gene flow. Our results provide evidence for multiple invasions of H. pruni into North America, suggesting that aphids in California may have been introduced from Spain, and aphids in the eastern United States and Vancouver, Canada were likely introduced from central or northern Europe. H. pruni populations in California were characterized by low genetic diversity relative to native populations, while the two other North American populations were less genetically impoverished. Gene flow among introduced populations was low, but does appear to occur with some regularity. These findings provide a framework for more detailed studies of H. pruni, but also represent a model for how population genetics approaches can be used to study invasion biology and aid the development of optimized management methods for agricultural pests.
