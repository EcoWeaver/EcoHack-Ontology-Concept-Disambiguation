Chemical control of the invasive Jackson's chameleon (Trioceros jacksonii xantholophus) in Hawaii
Invasive reptiles cause global ecosystem damage and are difficult to control once established. Visual detection and manual capture are time consuming and largely ineffective at eradication, particularly for cryptic species. The Jackson's chameleon (Trioceros jacksonii xantholophus), native to eastern Africa, is popular in the global pet trade and has become established in several localities, including the Hawaiian Islands where it has escaped or been intentionally released into sensitive native forest habitat where it feeds on endangered species. Here we tested an orally delivered, chemical toxicant as a feasible management technique for this invasive lizard in Hawaii. We administered predetermined dosages of powdered acetaminophen to adult chamleoens and determined that the dosage necessary to achieve 95% mortality within 48 h across size classes was 2000 mg/kg, or 90 mg of acetaminophen for an adult average mass of 45 g. Since the liver is known to process acetaminophen in vertebrate taxa, we conducted post mortem histological examination of liver tissue for all specimens at the 48 h time point. Finally, we propose a testable mechanism for field delivery of this oral toxicant following behavioral trials.
