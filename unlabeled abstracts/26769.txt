Do abandoned tree plantations resemble natural riparian forests? A case study from northeast Greece
Vasilopoulos G., Tsiripidis I. and Karagiannakidou V. 2007. Do abandoned tree plantations resemble natural riparian forests? A case study from northeast Greece. Bot. Helv. 117: 125- 142. The conversion of a riparian forest to plantations of fast-growing, exotic species (Populus x canadensis, Robinia pseudoacacia) may alter the floristic composition and soil properties, which may prevent the regeneration of natural forests when plantations are abandoned. Along the Nestos River in northeast Greece, we investigated how former plantations differ from natural forests after at least 14 years of abandonment. We carried out 60 vegetation releves and took soil samples in each plot to determine soil texture and chemical properties. Relationships between the forest type (natural vs. abandoned plantations), the floristic composition of the understory and soil properties were analysed with classification (TWINSPAN) and ordination (DCA). There was a clear floristic differentiation between natural forest and abandoned plantations, especially those of Robinia pseudoacacia. The topsoil of abandoned plantations had a lower content of organic matter and nitrogen, and the tree layer was still dominated by the formerly planted species. However, there was a similar floristic gradient, related mainly to soil texture (sandy vs. loamy sediments), in both the natural forest and abandoned plantations. Thus, even though the establishment of natural riparian forest species in the former plantations was scanty, their present floristic composition sufficiently reflects the natural ecological gradient to serve as a basis for a management plan to restore the natural riparian forest.
