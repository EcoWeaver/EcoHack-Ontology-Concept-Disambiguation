The Effects of Temporary Ballast Roadways on Heathland Vegetation
1. A series of trials was established to assess the effects of temporary roadways on heathland vegetation. These temporary roadways were set up on both dry and wet heath in Dorset (southern England). 2. The roadways were in place for periods of 2, 4 and 12 weeks in the spring, summer and autumn of 1986. 3. The mean height, percentage cover and species composition of the vegetation was recorded before treatment and at the end of each growing season (1986-88). 4. The mortality of rootstocks and the establishment of seedlings were assessed in October 1987. 5. The results showed that the plots disturbed early in the growing season regenerated more rapidly than those disturbed later in the year, and that this trend was continued in subsequent years. 6. No species was lost or severely reduced as a result of the treatments and changes in the abundance of some species were similar to those changes produced by standard heathland vegetation management. 7. Ten invasive species were recorded on the plots following treatment; none established in large enough numbers to change the original vegetation type.
