Latitudinal patterns of alien plant invasions
Latitudinal patterns of biodiversity have long been a central topic in ecology and evolutionary biology. However, while most previous studies have focused on native species , little effort has been devoted to latitudinal patterns of plant invasions (with a few exceptions based on data from sparse locations). Using the most up-to-date worldwide native and alien plant distribution data from 801 regions (including islands), we compared invasion levels (i.e. alien richness/total richness) in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and across continental regions and islands around the globe. Results from quantile regressions using B-splines to model nonlinearity showed (1) declining richness with increasing latitude, although the highest alien richness occurs at around 40 degrees in both hemispheres, (2) decreasing invasion levels towards higher latitudes on islands but a unimodal pattern in invasion level in continental regions in each hemisphere, (3) significantly higher invasion levels on islands than in continental regions and (4) a greater variability in invasion levels on islands at low latitudes than on high-latitude islands. In continental regions, only the mid-latitudes had high variability with both low and high invasion levels. Our findings identified latitudes with invasion hotspots where management is urgently needed, and latitudes with many areas of low invasions but high conservation potential where prevention of future invasions should be the priority.
