Economic Incentives to Prevent Aquatic Invasive Species in Wetlands
Wetlands are threatened by invasive species worldwide through vectors of aquaculture and aquarium activity. While maritime shipping has received most of the attention for invasive species control, shipping represents a mobile, transitory source of invasion, unlike aquaculture, and aquarium activities that occur in public wetlands. The public wetlands invasive species problem is modeled to compare incentives for one or all users of the public wetlands to reduce the threat of invasive species from aquaculture and aquarium trade activities. The incentives for individual versus coordinated behavior are examined, along with the conditions for all wetland users to select preemptive effort to reduce the invasive species threat. There is great potential for an environmental bond in the lease arrangements to foster preemptive effort to reduce invasive species in wetlands.
