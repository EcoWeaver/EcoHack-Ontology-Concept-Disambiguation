The Brazilian peppertree seed-borne pathogen, Neofusicoccum batangarum, a potential biocontrol agent
The invasive exotic Brazilian peppertree, Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (Sapindales: Anacardiaceae) has become a serious threat to the delicate ecosystem of Everglades National Park in Florida, USA. More than 4000 ha in the Hole-in-the-Donut (HID) area within the park have been infested with Brazilian peppertree. Brazilian peppertree is a prolific seed producer, which enhances its invasive potential. Native phytopathogens can be a viable tool in the management of exotic species; no prior studies have reported on the occurrence of native seed-borne pathogens of Brazilian peppertree in Florida. This study showed that drupes of Brazilian peppertree are affected by seed-borne fungal pathogens. These fungal pathogens either cause germination failure or attack seedlings after germination, which results in reduced vigor or seedling death. The seed-borne fungal isolate BPSPF-1 was found to be virulent, and when inoculated it was able to kill Brazilian peppertree seedlings in seedling assays, and 1 year old saplings in greenhouse trials. Field inoculation of Brazilian peppertree branches with BPSPF-1 resulted in dieback symptoms. Host range studies on one related native species (winged sumac, Rhus copallinum) and one non-native species (mango, Mangifera indica) showed that neither was affected by girdle inoculation of stems. The BPSPF-1 isolate produced dark melanized mycelium on agar media and did not produce conidia or other fruiting structures. Based on ITS DNA sequence analyses, the isolate was identified as Neofusicoccum batangarum.
