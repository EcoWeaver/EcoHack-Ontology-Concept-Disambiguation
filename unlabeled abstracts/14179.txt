First record and potential trophic impact ofPhyllorhiza punctata(Cnidaria: Scyphozoa) along the north Tunisian coast (South Western Mediterranean Sea)
The Australian spotted scyphomedusa Phyllorhiza punctata was recorded for the first time in Tunisian waters in August 2012, in the lagoon of Bizerte (Tunisia). Metaephyrae and juveniles occurred simultaneously in August 2012. The occurrence of adult medusae was detected from September to November 2012, and from August to October 2013. This is the second record of a reproducing population of P. punctata in the Mediterranean Sea. The low abundance of mesozooplankton in summer and autumn 2012 coincides temporally with the highest density of P. punctata recorded in the lagoon, suggesting that predation by this alien jellyfish may have been a limiting factor for the mesozooplankton abundance on site.
