Ensemble ecosystem modeling for predicting ecosystem response to predator reintroduction
Introducing a new, or previously extant, species to an ecosystem is a risky decision, and managers need quantitative methods that can predict the consequences for the recipient ecosystem. Proponents of keystone predator reintroductions commonly argue that the presence of the predator will restore ecosystem function, but this has not always been the case, and mathematical modeling has important role to play in predicting how reintroductions will likely play out. We propose an ensemble modeling method that integrates species interaction networks and dynamic community simulations, and use it to describe the range of plausible consequences of keystone predator reintroduction. Previous methods for predicting ecosystem responses to such interventions have focused on predicting changes around a given equilibrium state and have conceptual problems extrapolating to new equilibria (e.g., with the new species present). Our method predicts changing abundances through time and works equally well when the system is far from equilibrium. We illustrate this method by modeling the range of potential outcomes for the reintroduction of wolves (Canis lupus) to Yellowstone National Park, and of dingoes (Canis dingo) to a National Park in Australia, and demonstrate how the method can provide important guidance on the potential risks of reintroduction. Ensemble ecosystem modeling can also be applied to assess the ecosystem-wide implications of other types of interventions including assisted migration, biocontrol and invasive species eradication.
