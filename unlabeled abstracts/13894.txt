Macroecology of global bryophyte invasions at different invasion stages
In this study we provide the first comprehensive assessment of the environmental and anthropogenic factors driving bryophyte invasions worldwide. We compiled data of alien bryophyte distributions from 82 regions on five continents and oceanic islands and region specific variables. For each species, we collected data on its region-specific invasion stage, i.e. casual (ephemeral) vs naturalized (persistent) occurrences, and we differentiated between known aliens and those which are likely to be alien (cryptogenic). We used these data to test how species attributes, environmental and socio-economic conditions of the study areas as well as introduction effort affect invasion probabilities at different invasion stages and of known alien vs cryptogenic species. We collected information on species' attributes (native range size and location, niche breadth, habitat affiliation), and calculated variables characterising the environmental, biogeographic and socio-economic features of the native and recepient regions. Subsequently, we related the probability of alien occurrence across different invasion stages with these species- and region-wise predictor variables using generalized linear mixed effects models.
