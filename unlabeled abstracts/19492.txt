Integrity, Stability, and Beauty: Aldo Leopold's Evolving View of Nonnative Species
Aldo Leopold's distaste for introduced species was initially largely utilitarian, focused on his belief that they were usually less productive than natives. Catalyzed by a meeting with Charles Elton in 1931, as well as by his own developing land ethic and notion of land health, Leopold's focus shifted to the impact of nonnatives on native species, communities, and ecosystems. He depicted nonnative species not only as symptoms of land illness but often as causal, through their disruption of a type of biotic integrity that underlies land health. He also pointed to their frequent destabilizing effects, often associated with a loss of biotic diversity. Leopold manifested an aesthetic aversion to nonnatives, tacitly at first but more explicitly as his land aesthetic matured and became closely linked to his land ethic. Some of his statements regarding nonnatives can be interpreted as displaced nativism, but they more likely reflect aesthetic judgments and ecological concerns.
