Genetic divergence among invasive and native populations of the yellow peacock cichlid Cichla kelberi
This study used the hypervariable domain of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (CR) to assess the genetic divergence among native and invasive populations of Cichla kelberi, which is considered the first peacock cichlid introduced and established throughout Brazil and is among the most invasive populations of this genus worldwide. The maximum likelihood tree based on 53 CR sequences with strong bootstrap support revealed that C. kelberi forms a monophyletic clade, confirming that all 30 C. kelberi studied belong to this morphotype. Additionally, the haplotype analysis of the C. kelberi sequences from 11 sampling sites revealed that invasive populations are much less diverse than native ones and largely dominated by a single haplotype that prevailed in reservoirs at the Paraiba do Sul River basin. Two haplotypes were recorded exclusively in an invasive population at Porto Rico, southern Brazil, and one private haplotype was detected in two reservoirs from Paraiba do Sul (Pereira Passos and Paracambi), suggesting more than one introduction event and that native populations should be better evaluated to encompass the entire genetic diversity of native C. kelberi. The possible route and pathways of C. kelberi introduction are also briefly discussed.
