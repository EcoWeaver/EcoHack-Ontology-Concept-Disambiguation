A natural history museum as a platform for accumulating verifiable information on non-native fishes: a Japanese example
Natural history museums provide permanent storage for specimen collections, including non-native species. We extracted the records for specimens and photographs of exotic non-native fishes collected in Japan by experts and citizens at the Kanagawa Prefectural Museum of Natural History, Japan. The museum began operation in 1994. The records of alien species known to be established in Japan (FSAK) consisted of 1756 specimens (789 lots) belonging to 29 species and 611 photographs (494 lots) of 25 species. Additionally, there were records of alien species that were introduced to Japan but not known to be established (FSUK) consisting of 23 specimens (23 lots) belonging to 11 species and of 46 photographs (31 lots) of 17 species. The FSAK could be classified as 23 primary freshwater, six diadromous, and one marine species, whereas the FSUK were classified as 12 primary freshwater, one diadromous, and six marine species. We identified a significant difference in the life-cycle types of FSAK and FSUK suggesting that fluvial species are established more easily than marine species, which reflects the biogeography of Japan. In addition, the records of FSUK were probably caused by an increase of aquarium fish introductions due to dereliction of pet fish, ejectment for pleasure, or crime by traders. The museum collections were mostly provided by experts, followed by citizens and other institutions. We also discussed the functions of a public museum of natural history for accumulating information and for citizen participation.
