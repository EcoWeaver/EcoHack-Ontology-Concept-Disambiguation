Replacement of the Indigenous Amphipod Gammarus duebeni celticus by the Introduced G. pulex: Differential Cannibalism and Mutual Predation
Following introductions in the 1950s, Gammarus pulex has replaced the native Irish freshwater amphipod G. duebeni celticus in several river systems. G. pulex has eliminated and replaced G.d.celticus in lower sections of the Rivaer Lagan system, N.Ireland, although G.d.celticus maintains pure populations upstream. More rarely, the two species may be found together. G.d.celticus was significantly more cannibalistic on moulted conspecifics than G. pulex. Mutual predation by intermoult individuals on moulted congenerics was observed in all combinations of adult males and females, including those in the precopulatory mate-guarding phase, and juveniles. In general, predation by G. pulex on G.d.celticus. Predation was differentially in favour of G. pulex in most combinations. A model is presented incorporating resource exploitation competition, cannibalism and mutual predation. The behaviour of the model agrees with intuitive predictions. Cannibalism in the absence of predation promotes coexistence, whereas mutual but differential predation in the absence of cannibalism may lead to elimination, depending on relative resource competitive ability. When cannibalism and predation occur together, predation of equal magnitude or greater than cannibalism leads to rapid elimination. Predation in favour of species 1 may overcome a competitive advantage for species 2, leading to elimination of species 2. The superior abilities of G. pulex to resist predatory attacks and to prey on moulted G.d.celticus may be major features of the elimination and relacement of the latter species by the former. -from Authors
