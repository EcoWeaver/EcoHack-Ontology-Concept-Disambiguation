Freshwater mollusc biodiversity and conservation in two stressed Mediterranean basins
This paper reviews the environmental factors that influence biodiversity of freshwater mollusc communities and conservation status of watercourses in two Mediterranean acid mine drainage-impacted basins of the southern Iberian Peninsula. We found 17 mollusc species: 14 gastropods (10 native and 4 introduced) and 3 bivalves. We found five distribution patterns: native headwater (Arganiella wolfi, Stagnicola palustris, Unio delphinus, Pisidium casertanum and Pisidium personatum) and mouth (Hydrobia acuta, Peringia ulvae and Myosotella myosotis) sensitive-stenochoric species, intermediate sensitive-widely distributed species (Planorbarius metidjensis and Radix balthica), insensitive-eurychoric species (Ancylus fluviatilis), and erratic-distribution pattern species (Galba truncatula and Planorbis carinatus). The highest biodiversity indices have been found in non-impacted headwaters and, to a lesser extent, in tidal streams. The biodiversity of the middle reaches, with varying degrees of impact by acid mine drainage and high water deficit, was scarce and dominated by introduced species. Over 30% of the variation in native and introduced species richness is explained by environmental gradients related to heterogeneity (instream macrophytes cover and Fhi and Qbr indices) and acid runoffs (pH, conductivity, turbidity and concentration of sulphides). Severely impacted sites have no mollusc species. The conservation status of watercourses is also very remarkably influenced by the heterogeneity and contamination of the environment. Conservation values are higher in water bodies located in protected northern and southern sites in both basins.
