A review of the introduced herpetofauna of Mexico and Central America, with comments on the effects of invasive species and biosecurity methodology
Among the principal causes producing detrimental effects on global biodiversity are introductions of alien species. Very few attempts to control introduced amphibians and reptiles in Middle America (Mexico and Central America) can be identified, so listings are provided for 24 exotic species, 16 translocated species, and 11 species that were removed from the introduced species listing because of lack of substantiating evidence that they are from established populations. Biosecurity methods are also identified that can be applied for preventing, controlling, and managing introduced and especially invasive species.
