Differential responses to allelopathic compounds released by the invasiveAcacia dealbataLink (Mimosaceae) indicate stimulation of its own seed
Invasion by exotic species constitutes a major threat to natural ecosystems. One of the most invasive species of current concern in Europe is Acacia dealbata Link (Mimosaceae), the expansion of which is reducing populations of native species, and hence biodiversity. To investigate the potential involvement of allelopathic mechanisms in this process, we evaluated the germination and seedling growth performance of Lactuca sativa L. (Compositae), Zea mays L. (Gramineae), Dactylis glomerata L. (Gramineae), Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (Cruciferae) and A. dealbata, in the presence of mixtures of throughfall and litter leachate and of aqueous soil extracts collected under A. dealbata at different times of the year. Each test species responded differently to the solutions being assayed suggesting that A. dealbata allelochemicals may affect a variety of physiological growth parameters. In most cases the observed effects were stimulatory rather than inhibitory, which may have long-term deleterious effects on native plant populations since premature growth during periods of poor resources can be detrimental. Interestingly, increased radical growth of A. dealbata was detected with either extract suggesting a positive autoalleloapthy effect.
