Multiple pathways for Plasmodium ookinete invasion of the mosquito midgut
Significance Malaria is among the most devastating parasitic diseases. Invasion of the mosquito midgut by motile malaria ookinetes requires specific interactions between proteins of both organisms. This study reports on a novel mosquito midgut receptor [enolase-binding protein (EBP)] that is recognized by an ookinete surface ligand (enolase). We also show that Plasmodium ookinetes invade the mosquito midgut by at least two different pathways: one dependent on and the other independent of the EBP-enolase interaction. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a second universal midgut receptor essential for midgut invasion by both human and rodent malaria parasites. These findings may lead to the development of novel targets for transmission-blocking interventions.
