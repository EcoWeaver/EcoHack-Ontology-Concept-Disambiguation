The beginning of the end? Extensive dieback of an open-grown Amur honeysuckle stand in northern Kentucky, USA
Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) is recognized as one of the most important invasive species in the Ohio River Valley. In 2012-2013, an outbreak of honeysuckle leaf blight on this species was observed in the region around Cincinnati, OH, USA. Dieback of open-grown honeysuckle stands was then noted in 2013, along with reduced physiological performance. One of these stands with signs of blight and dieback was surveyed in late summer 2013. The honeysuckle dead/total stem density fraction was 61.8 %, compared to 3.2 % reported in the 1980s. The dead/total basal area fraction was 36.9 %. The stem population size structure may also indicate a decline. Future work is needed to determine how widespread the decline is and if the leaf blight is the causative agent or an opportunistic infection.
