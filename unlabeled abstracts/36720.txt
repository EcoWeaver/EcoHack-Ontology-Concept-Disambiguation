Range Expansion and Factors Affecting Abundance of Invasive Flathead Catfish in the Delaware and Susquehanna Rivers, Pennsylvania, USA
Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris have either been intentionally or accidentally introduced to Atlantic Slope drainages extending from Florida to Pennsylvania and have quickly become established. In Pennsylvania, Flathead Catfish were first detected in the Schuylkill River at the Fairmont Dam in 1999 and in the Susquehanna River at Safe Harbor Dam in 2002. The species has since moved throughout the respective basins with subsequent detections in 244 riverine surveys in these drainages. Fishway and electrofishing surveys in the tidal Schuylkill River, a Delaware River tributary, have documented an increase in abundances since 2004 when they were first implemented. Hoop net surveys in non-tidal large river reaches found mean (+- SD) catch rates varying from 0 to 4.51 +- 4.38 fish/series. A Bayesian hierarchical Poisson regression model found that Flathead Catfish abundance decreased as the distance from the initial point of detection increased, demonstrating a general pattern of fish expanding upstream from the point of detection. The distance downstream of the nearest dam, while not significant, had relatively high posterior probability of being negatively correlated to Flathead Catfish abundance. Ongoing and future targeted surveys should help to better understand changes in distribution and abundance of Flathead Catfish in these systems.
