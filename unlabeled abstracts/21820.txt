Foliar production and decomposition rates in urban forests invaded by the exotic invasive shrub, Lonicera maackii
Exotic invasive shrubs can form dense monocultures in forest understories, which can have cascading effects on ecosystem structure and function. Amur honeysuckle, an exotic shrub that forms dense canopies in eastern forests, has the potential to alter plant community structure and ecosystem functions, such as primary production and decomposition. The goal of this study was to examine foliar productivity and leaf litter decomposition in forests invaded by Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) and to determine the extent to which the presence of this dominant exotic species may alter ecosystem function in these forests. We found that forests invaded by Amur honeysuckle had 16times greater honeysuckle foliar biomass and 1.5times lower total foliar biomass than forests of equivalent tree basal area, but having few honeysuckle shrubs. This suggests that productivity of native tree and shrub species may be reduced where honeysuckle density is high. Additionally, honeysuckle litter decayed four times faster and released nitrogen more rapidly than sugar maple litter, and sugar maple litter decayed 19% faster in forests invaded by Amur honeysuckle. These findings suggest that forests invaded by Amur honeysuckle may exhibit lower rates of organic matter accrual and less nitrogen retention in the forest floor. Since honeysuckle leaves develop in early spring before those of other shrubs or trees in the area, the rapid release of nitrogen from honeysuckle litter that we measured in early spring is timed to benefit this invasive species. The temporally coincident phenologies of nitrogen release during decomposition with the foliar growth needs of this shrub indicates that a potential positive feedback loop may exist between these processes that promotes continued growth and dominance of honeysuckle shrubs in these forested systems.
