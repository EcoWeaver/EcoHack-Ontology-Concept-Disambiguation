Development of microsatellite markers and the genetic diversity of Myocastor coypus introduced to South Korea
The nutria (Myocastor coypus) was introduced to South Korea in 1987 for breeding of individuals for fur and meat industry, and was accidentally released into the wild. Here, we report the development of microsatellites for the nutria collected from South Korea using Illumina MiSeq genome sequencing to identify the genetic variability and demographic history of these introduced populations. A total of 626,282 microsatellite sequences were identified, and nine polymorphic loci were characterized. We used four novel loci developed and three previously known loci to investigate the genetic diversity of twelve South Korean populations. A low level of diversity was found, and no signature of genetic structuring was revealed among populations, indicating that Korean nutria individuals originated from a single population or a highly inbred reared herd.
