Are invasive plants an inevitable consequence of evolution?
Any new species must begin its existence as a small isolated population competing either against an abundant established biota or an alien environment or both. What gives it the edge to survive is likely to be unique for each species that makes it through those early challenges, but what they all share in common is the capacity to reproduce in excess and to compete successfully against whatever biotic or abiotic competitors they encounter. Given this straightforward statement about speciation, Jonathan Silvertown, a prominent plant ecologist from the Open University, UK, asks the simple question, ''Why hasn't the ultimate competitor come along that can dominate all others and reign supreme in plant communities everywhere, or at least broadly across common landscapes?'' While I've never seen the question of what causes and maintains biodiversity asked in exactly that way before, it makes sense when considered in light of the tremendous success some species have had when introduced into new communities or landscapes, often
