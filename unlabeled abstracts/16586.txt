Impacts of Wetland Restoration Efforts on an Amphibian Assemblage in a Multi-invader Community
The success of restoration in attaining wildlife conservation goals can be strongly dependent on both site-scale and landscape-scale habitat characteristics, particularly for species with complex life cycles. Wetland management activities typically target plant communities, and bottom-up responses in higher trophic levels may be dependent on spatially explicit habitat use. We surveyed plant and amphibian assemblages at 26 sites enrolled in the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) in the Willamette Valley, Oregon to determine the relative influence of plant management, non-native species, and surrounding landscape on amphibian counts across multiple life history stages. Explanatory variables negatively associated with native anuran counts included percent invasive plant cover, non-native fish presence, invasive bullfrog counts, and area of urban land cover. In addition, native anurans were positively associated with WRP site age, suggesting that the benefits of restored wetlands may increase over time. This study emphasized the importance of adaptive approaches to maintaining diverse communities in restored habitats by considering impacts of synergistic stressors in a multi-invader context. Although invasive plant management provided indirect benefits to native amphibians, the most effective way to enhance native amphibian populations may be through eliminating the strong top-down forces exerted by non-native vertebrates.
