Use of Geographic Information Systems to monitor and predict non-native aquatic plant dispersal through north-eastern North America
North America has a growing problem with invasive aquatic plants. At every level of the aquatic food web, long-standing checks and balances have become dramatically eroded by the introduction of non-native species. The northeastern United States contains thousands of diverse freshwater habitats, highly heterogeneous in geology and locale, where nuisance aquatic plant growth results in decreased lake water quality, interference with recreational access, degraded flood control structures, and impacts to their aesthetic quality. Early infestation and spread of exotic species is often poorly documented at local and state levels. Consequently, successful management of these species depends on continuous monitoring and definitive identification by both public officials and waterside homeowners. With new mapping capabilities employing software such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) coupled with the growing computerization of taxonomic records and online availability of regional herbarium records, we have been able to illustrate thetemporal and geographic spread of these species, thus enabling aquatic ecologists and managers to make predictions of future infestations. In this paper we evaluate these techniques focusing on three of the most pervasive of exotic aquatic plant species in New York State: Myriophyllum spicatum, Trapa natans and Potamogeton crispus.
