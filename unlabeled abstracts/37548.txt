Lethal effects of leaf leachate from the non-native invasive shrub Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) on a model aquatic organism (Hyalella azteca)
The invasive shrub Lonicera maackii (Amur honeysuckle) is a problematic species in the eastern United States and there is growing evidence that materials from this species have toxic effects on some organisms. We used a sequence of microcosm bioassays to assess the influence of L. maackii leaf leachate on the macroinvertebrate Hyalella azteca, which is a standard aquatic organism for toxicity assessment. In a laboratory setting, H. azteca were exposed to a leaf leachate dilution series (6.25%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, 100%) in 48-h toxicity tests. This was repeated throughout the growing season to assess the potential for changes in leaf toxicity due to phenology. Strong toxic effects were found when H. azteca was exposed to a L. maackii leachate from autumn (P < 0.05) and, in fact, all organisms died when exposed to any level of concentration in most trials. Mean percent survival also decreased significantly in all dilutions in the spring (P < 0.05 for all treatments); however, little toxicity was detected in growing season trials. These results suggest (a) strong toxic effects of L. maackii foliage on a model aquatic organism that (b) varies throughout the year, potentially in relationship to biochemical changes associated with phenology.
