The complete chloroplast genome of alien invasive species, <i>Diodia virginiana</i> L. (rubiaceae), in China
The first complete chloroplast genome sequences of new intercepted alien weeds in China, Diodia, were reported in this study. The D. virginiana plastome was 154,387 bp long, with the large single copy (LSC) region of 83,625 bp, the small single copy (SSC) region of 17,475 bp, and two inverted repeat (IR) regions of 26,643 bp. The plastome contained 137 genes, including 92 proteincoding, eight ribosomal RNA, and 37 transfer RNA genes. The overall GC content was 37.2%. Phylogenetic analysis of 24 representative plastomes within the order Gentianales suggests that subfamily Cinchonoideae is closely related to subfamily Ixoroideae compared with subfamily Rubioideae in Rubiaceae. Tribe Spermacoceae was most closely related to Rubieae among the three representative groups of subfamily Rubioideae.
