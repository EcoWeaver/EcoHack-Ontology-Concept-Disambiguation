The role of human disturbance in island biogeography of arthropods and plants: an information theoretic approach
Recent progress in island biogeography indicates that classical island biogeography alone cannot encapsulate the complex and dynamic nature of island biogeographical processes. Factors such as habitat complexity and connectivity, and in the face of the Anthropocene, human disturbance and invasive species, may influence insular communities. The relative importance of these factors, however, may differ among groups of biota. Here we employed an information theoretic approach to investigate factors likely to explain patterns in species richness and assemblage composition of five different groups of arthropods (ants, beetles, flies, spiders and cockroaches) and native and exotic plants within an insular community.
