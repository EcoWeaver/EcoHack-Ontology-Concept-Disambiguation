The impact of forest infrastructure reconstruction on expansion of potentially invasive plant species: First results from a study in Latvia
Today, when anthropogenic pressure on natural ecosystems promotes degradation of natural habitats and facilitates distribution of alien species, local disturbances such as forest management become more significant in relation to alien plant species expansion. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of forest road and drainage network reconstruction on the vegetation composition focusing on the expansion of invasive alien plant species. The occurrence and coverage of vascular plant and bryophyte species were recorded within 160 sample plots along four forest roads and four drainage ditches. This paper summarises the first results of this study. The main results indicate that small-scale linear corridors like forest roads and drainage networks can promote the expansion of invasive alien plant species.
