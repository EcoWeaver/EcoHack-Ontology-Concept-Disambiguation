Stable isotopes, mesocosms and gut content analysis demonstrate trophic differences in two invasive decapod crustacea
1. Improving our understanding of dietary differences among omnivorous, benthic crustacea can help to define the scope of their trophic influence in benthic food webs. In this study, we examined the trophic ecology of two non-native decapod crustaceans, the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) (CMC) and the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) (RSC), in the San Francisco Bay ecosystem to describe their food web impacts and explore whether these species are functionally equivalent in their impacts on aquatic benthic communities.
