The recent geographical expansion of Caprella californica (Caprellidea: Caprellidae) around the coastline of Australia
The amphipod Caprella californica is native to California, but is known from the Pacific coast of North America, Mexico, Chile, Japan, Hong Kong and South Africa. C. californica is able to raft on kelp (Morris et al. 1980), and has been recorded on man-made structures such as rafts, settlement ropes and biofouling prone assemblages on ship hulls. Of interest is the recent rapid expansion of Caprella californica in Australian waters from its first recorded sighting in Sydney Harbour in 2002, to several recorded sightings over the last 4years at Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, Hobsons Bay, Victoria, and the Port of Cairns, Queensland.
