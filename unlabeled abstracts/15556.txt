Native and Exotic Birds in a Suburban Habitat
The exotic and native birds in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, including the campus of Monash University, were studied during 1974-77. The proportion of exotic to native birds was far greater in suburban than native habitats. 'Total native vegetation' was found to be the most influential factor governing the number of both native and exotic birds, showing a positive and a negative correlation respectively. 'Total exotic plants' and various vegetation heights were also correlated, but were less important. The ground was the major foraging site for birds as a whole, followed by Eucalyptus spp. Native birds foraged proportionately more than did exotic birds on native rather than exotic plants, and in trees or shrubs rather than on the ground. When not foraging, they were seen proportionately more often than the exotics on native rather than exotic plants, and the exotics were seen proportionately far more often than the natives on artificial structures.
