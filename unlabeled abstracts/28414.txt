Sem study on the invasion of Nomuraea rileyi (Farlow) on silkworm, Bombyx mori Linn. causing green muscardine
The mature conidia of Nomuraea rileyi (Farlow) germinate on the larval integument of Bombyx mori within 24 h and penetrate the cuticle within 36 h after inoculation at 24.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C temperature and 80.0 +/- 5.0% relative humidity. The penetrating hyphae multiply by budding and septa formation in the hemocoel, and the larva succumbs to the infection 6-7 days post-treatment. The hyphal bodies elongate and become interwoven with other hyphae forming a mycelial complex across different tissues. The ramification of hyphae along the epidermal tissue results in larval mummification in 7-8 days. Numerous conidiophores emerge, producing a confluent white fungal mat over the entire surface of the host larva by 9-10 days. Pale green conidia develop, making the larval body green. Life cycle of the fungus on B. mori is completed in 10-11 days.
