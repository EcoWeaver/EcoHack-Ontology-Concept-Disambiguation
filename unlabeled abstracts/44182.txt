INVASIVE PLANT ALLIGATOR WEED (ALTERNANTHERA PHILOXEROIDES (MART.) GRISEB.) PERFORMS BETTER TO SALINITY, DROUGHT AND ABSCISIC ACID STRESSES THAN NATIVE PLANT SESSILE JOY WEED (ALTERNANTHERA SESSILIS (L.))
Abbas et al.: Invasive plant alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb.) performs better to salinity, drought and abscisic acid stresses than native plant sessile joy weed (Alternanthera sessilis (L.))-1173-APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH 20(2): 1173-1187. Abstract. Invasive plant species have been reported to have advantages over native species in growth-and physiological traits; however, such characteristics have not been discussed under saline, water-scarce conditions. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of salinity and drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) application on the morphological and physiological traits of invasive and native weed species. We established three experiments as (i) salinity stress, control with no salt application, 100 and 150 mM NaCl; (ii) drought stress, control-no drought, 75 and 100 gL-1 PEG-6000; and (iii) ABA application, control-no application, 25 and 50 ulL-1. Two weed species, the invasive Alternanthera philoxeroides and native Alternanthera sessilis, were used in all experiments. The study was laid out in a completely randomized design (CRD) with factorial arrangements and twelve replications. Results revealed that both invasive A. philoxeroides and native A. sessilis species survived under high salt and drought stress conditions. A. philoxeroides species generally showed higher morphological and physiological growth under high salt and drought levels, showing higher tolerance to stress conditions than A. sessilis. Moreover, the morphological and physiological traits of A. philoxeroides were elevated more under ABA application. Our results showed higher values of morpho-physiological traits might partly explain the success of A. philoxeroides under saline and drought conditions.
