Assessing the Value of Novel Habitats to Snail Kites through Foraging Behavior and Nest Survival
Abstract Novel ecosystems arise for a variety of reasons, most notably from the introduction of nonnative species. Understanding the interactions between traditional habitats, novel habitats, and species of conservation interest is important when planning successful conservation strategies. In the United States, the snail kite Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus is a federally endangered species whose population in Florida has undergone declines within the past decade. While studying the foraging behavior of breeding snail kites on Lake Tohopekaliga (Lake Toho), we discovered the unexpected use of disturbed ephemeral wetlands adjacent to the lake. These wetlands represent a novel habitat for snail kites; they would not have been viable foraging areas prior to the introduction of the exotic island apple snail Pomacea maculata. By examining the differences between snail kite behavior in traditional and novel habitats, we were able to identify some characteristics of novel habitats that may be important in determining their value to snail kites. The novel wetland areas were highly attractive to snail kites, likely because of the high snail capture rates. The survival of snail kite nests occurring within the novel areas appeared to be similar to that of nests occurring in more traditional, nearby areas on Lake Toho. However, whether or not snail kites used novel habitats as nesting areas appeared to be dependent upon water depth and availability of nesting substrate within these areas. The snail kites' dynamic use of the novel habitat demonstrates both the value of a novel ecosystem and the importance of traditional habitats to a species of conservation concern.
