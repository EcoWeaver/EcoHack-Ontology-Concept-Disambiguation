Occurrence of the non-native fish Salminus brasiliensis (Cuvier, 1816), in a global biodiversity ecoregion, Iguacu River, Parana River basin, Brazil
We register here the first occurrence of the "dourado" Salminus brasiliensis (family: Characidae) in Salto Santiago Reservoir in the Iguacu River basin, Parana State, Brazil, a global biodiversity ecoregion with an extremely rich endemic ichthyofauna. The single specimen captured, an adult female measuring 480 -mm total length, was taken with gillnet in January 2008. No additional S. brasiliensis were captured during general fish surveys conducted at four sites in the reservoir even though multiple types of gear were used (gill and trammel nets and long-line fishing) over a period of nearly two years (bimonthly from July 2006 to September 2008). The presence of S. brasiliensis, a large, predacious freshwater species native to other parts of Brazil, may be related to its use as a sport fish, and the single specimen taken from the reservoir may have escaped from ponds built by aquaculturists for recreational angling. Before appropriate management measures are taken, additiona l field work is needed to determine the status and distribution of S. brasiliensis in the Iguacu basin and to assess possible negative effects of the introduction on native fishes.
