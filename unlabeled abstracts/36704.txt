The exotic American eel in Taiwan: ecological implications
Six American eels Anguilla rostrata were identified in the Kaoping River of south-western Taiwan by sequencing the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (mtCyt-b). This was the first record of an exotic eel species in the natural waters of Taiwan. The exotic eels may have been imported from North America at the elver stage for aquaculture and escaped from culture ponds.
