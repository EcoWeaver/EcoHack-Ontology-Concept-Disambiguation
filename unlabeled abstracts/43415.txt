Community stability and seasonal biotic homogenisation emphasize the effect of the invasive tropical tanner grass on macrophytes from a highly dynamic neotropical tidal river
We described the spatial and temporal dynamics of aquatic macrophytes in a Neotropical coastal estuarine river, and identified the negative effects associated to the presence and dominance of the invasive tanner grass. We compared macrophyte beds along the Guaraguacu River (South Brazil) over four years, using taxonomic and functional dimensions. Biodiversity descriptors were higher in the driest periods compared to the rainiest, although this difference seems to be decreasing over the studied years. Moreover, the spatial organization of biodiversity and community structure slightly changed over time. Such spatial community stability was highlighted by the dominance of the highly invasive tanner grass. In beds dominated by the invasive species, the biodiversity was reduced. As aquatic macrophytes represent an important group in water bodies, the long-term loss of seasonal differences in community structuring is of concern, mainly regarding its potential to impact other groups and ecosystem functioning. By analysing data from standardized monitoring, we were able to identify a poorly discussed facet of biotic homogenisation-the seasonal homogenisation. We also discussed the impact of massive development of invasive species and its consequences for biodiversity in a Neotropical river of outmost importance for biological conservation.
