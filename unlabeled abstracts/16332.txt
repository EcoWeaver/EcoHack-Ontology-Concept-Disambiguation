Identification of potentially invasive species of black flies [Diptera: Simuliidae] from Armenia based on an analysis of variability in the mtDNA barcode of the cox1 gene and chromosomal polymorphism
Black flies (Diptera, Simuliidae) are well known for their medical, environmental, and veterinary importance. The simuliid fauna of Armenia includes 53 species. A number of dominant species are of ecological importance. Complex analysis, which involved morphometric, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic approaches, was conducted to characterize the species status of black flies inhabiting the territory of Armenia. It was shown that the predominant simuliid species, Simulium paraequinum and Simulium kiritshenkoi, belong to a group of species with minimal variability of the cox1 gene. The recently discovered species, Simulium noellery and Simulium [B.] erythrocephalum, which are new to Armenia, can be considered as potentially invasive, which is supported by the low level of variability of the cox1 gene.
