Isolation and characterization of polymorphic microsatellite loci for the invasive plant Cytisus scoparius
Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) is a serious weed of natural and pastoral ecosystems and is invasive in many countries worldwide. Eight polymorphic microsatellite loci were developed and characterized for this species. The number of alleles per locus ranged from five to 23. The range of observed heterozygosity was between 0.207 and 0.928. These microsatellite markers will be useful tools for studies of population genetics in the native and invasive range of this species.
