Macro-habitat, micro-habitat segregation and breeding success of the 'vulnerable' native European turtle dove and the 'invasive' Eurasian collared dove from a North African agricultural area
Studies of the ecological niche segregation among Columbidae birds have principally addressed feeding resources while segregating in relation to nest niche differentiation and breeding success have been little investigated. The wide extension of the invasive collared dove (S. decaocto) distribution throughout North African ecosystems has raised questions regarding its impact on native species, principally the vulnerable turtle dove (S. turtur). The study, conducted between March and September 2017-2019, attempted to determine levels of nest-niche differentiation between the two competitive dove species in the Fez's agricultural area (Morocco). We used macro-habitat parameters inside olive orchards and micro-habitat parameters on nesting olive trees to evaluate the segregation of nest-niche between the two species. The results show substantial niche partitioning in the olive orchards and nest-trees selected by both doves. Collared doves nested in the periphery of orchards where the human impact was higher, and used greater height for nest placement on the olive trees, while turtle dove nested in the centre of orchards and placed nests in the lower height. Observed nest-niche partitioning may reduce the probability of concurrence between these sympatric birds and improve breeding success, higher in the studied sites for both doves (Hanane 2017). We also recommend guidelines for future research that search to understand the use of foraging resources by collared and turtle doves in the region during breeding seasons.
