Factors affecting the geographical distribution of invasive species in China
Frequent international trade has accelerated the invasion of alien species. However, data on the distribution of invasive species after their introduction and the factors that determine their geographical distribution are lacking. This study analyzes the distributional trends and their drivers of invasive species in China. In addition, 13 main invasive insect pests were selected for the dynamic analysis of their spatial distributions in China before the reform and opening up (1978), from 1979 to 2001, and since China's accession to the World Trade Organization to explore the effects of increased international trade on the geographical distribution of invasive species in China. The results showed that the abundance of invasive species gradually decreased from south to north and from southeast to inland. Guangdong Province (442 species) and Yunnan Province (404 species) have the highest abundance of invasive species. Among the 13 key invasive insects investigated, 3, 10 and 13 occurred in the three investigated periods, and the numbers of invaded provinces were 7, 28 and 34. The results suggest that alien pests invaded China through Xinjiang, the Bohai Rim and the southeast. Value of imports was a strong predictor of the number of invasive species in China. The value of imports and secondarily to temperature heterogeneity were key drivers in explaining patterns of the richness for invasive animals, plants and insects but not for microorganisms. The results provide a scientific basis for further international quarantine and the effective control of invasive species.
