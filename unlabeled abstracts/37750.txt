Independent introductions and sequential founder events shape genetic differentiation and diversity of the invasive green anole (Anolis carolinensis) on Pacific Islands
Natural range expansions and human-mediated colonizations usually involve a small number of individuals that establish new populations in novel habitats. In both cases, founders carry only a fraction of the total genetic variation of the source populations. Here, we used native and non-native populations of the green anole, Anolis carolinensis, to compare the current distribution of genetic variation in populations shaped by natural range expansion and human-mediated colonization.
