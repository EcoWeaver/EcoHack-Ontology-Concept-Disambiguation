On the ecology and biology of invasive species Cyclachaena xanthiifolia (Nutt.) Fresen. in the Southern Urals and Cisural region
Ecological and biological characteristics of Cyclachaena xanthiifolia (Nutt.) Fresen., have been studied in four regions of the Southern Urals and Cisural region. Communities including this species have been attributed to association Ivetum xanthiifoliae Fijalkowski 1967 of the class Stellarietea mediae R.Tx., Lohmeyer et Preising 1950. It has been shown that ecological habitat conditions have a significant effect on the majority of morphometric parameters of C. xanthiifolia, accounting for 1.3 to 51.4% of their total variance. Seed production averages 6500 seeds per plant. Extensive dispersal of the species over the Southern Ural region is predicted.
