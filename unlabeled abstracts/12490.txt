First record of the non-native bryozoan Amathia (= Zoobotryon) verticillata (delle Chiaje, 1822) (Ctenostomata) in the Galapagos Islands
The warm water marine bryozoan Amathia (= Zoobotryon) verticillata (delle Chiaje, 1822) is reported for the first time in the Galapagos Islands based upon collections in 2015. Elsewhere, this species is a major fouling organism that can have significant negative ecological and economic effects. Comprehensive studies will be necessary to determine the extent of the distribution of A. verticillata in the Galapagos and its effects on native species. The establishment of A. verticillata emphasizes the need for regular monitoring of those vectors that could bring additional non-native species to the Archipelago.
