A reciprocal test of Darwin's naturalization hypothesis in two mediterranean-climate regions
Regions with a mediterranean climate are among the most species-rich regions in the world. They are also among the regions with the greatest number of non-native invasive species. However, not all introduced species become invasive. Previously, we found that non-native Asteraceae closely related to native species are more likely to establish and spread in California, USA. We conducted reciprocal studies in another mediterranean-climate region with high species richness, the Italian Peninsula. Mediterranean Basin invaders in the Astereae mostly originated in temperate North America, whereas the invasive Cardueae of California are primarily from the Mediterranean Basin.
