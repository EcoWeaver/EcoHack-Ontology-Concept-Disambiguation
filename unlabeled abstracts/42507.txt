New Vision on Invasive Alien Plant Management System
Abstract Since the creation of the European Union's (EU) Biodiversity Strategy, increased attention has been drawn to the spread of invasive non-native species, their impact on biodiversity, and the economic losses caused. Ensuring compliance with the regulation on the eradication of invasive species requires financial means, therefore a new vision on invasive plant management system is proposed. With a new system, invasive alien plant (IAP) control is ensured as well as a new source of lignocellulosic biomass for product production, that could result in financial gains is presented. This article provides current alien plant situation visualization by Sankey diagram showing invasiveness of alien species and establishment, after which invasive and potentially invasive species are directed further to pre-assessment. A total of 157 invasive plant species are evaluated by multi criteria decision analysis TOPSIS, the case on the national level (Latvia) is presented and a new concept for a IAP management system is provided. The research results and the new concept provide a contribution to policy makers, land owners affected by invasive species and municipalities.
