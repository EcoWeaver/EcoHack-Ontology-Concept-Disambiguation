Kiwinematidae n. fam. (Nematoda) for Kiwinema n. g. and Hatterianema Chabaud & Dollfus, 1966: heterakoids of native New Zealand vertebrates
Heterakis gracilicauda Harris, 1975 is redescribed as the type-species of Kiwinema n.g., which is referred to the Kiwinematidae n. fam. with Hatterianema Chabaud & Dollfus, 1966. The morphology of the genera, both from indigenous New Zealand hosts, reinforces the probability that the heterakoidea arose in Gondwanaland.
