Sampling adequacy estimation for plant species composition by accumulation curves--A case study of urban vegetation in Beijing, China
Species accumulation curves are commonly used to evaluate sampling adequacy under natural conditions, but their performance in urban conditions still requires examination. The built-up area of Beijing, was chosen as a case study, and specific insight was gained into accumulation curves of plant species composition. The characteristics examined were plant species richness, percentage of alien plant species, chorotypes percentage (assemblages of species with similar geographical ranges), and the importance value of the dominant tree species. We showed: (1) the plant species accumulation curves significantly fitted the power function relationship, but the curves were nowhere near any asymptote, and the traditional method to locate an adequate sampling effort were found to be invalid in this case; (2) to evaluate the sampling adequacy for plant species composition, it was more appropriate to use the coefficient of variation for the first-order jackknife estimator as a substitute for species richness; (3) accumulation curves for the importance value of the dominant tree species, the curves for the percentage of alien species, and the curves for chorotypes percentages showed different accumulation trends compared to that of species richness. However, because they reached a steady state much sooner than species richness, the sampling effort required for adequate estimation of these indexes was generally below that for species richness. As shown in this study of a relatively complex species composition in the urban condition, the accumulation curves of different characteristics of a subject are a promising way to estimate sampling adequacy for complex research subjects.
