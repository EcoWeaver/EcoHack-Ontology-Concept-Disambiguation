Do birds understand what's going on in their nests? The experimental test of insight in small passerines
In the present study we test the ability of insight (solving novel problems) in a small passerine. Our paper reports on the predation of Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla nestlings by the Spanish Slug Arion lusitanicus and the reaction of bird parents to a novel predator. The Spanish slug is an invasive pest species, first documented in the study area in recent years. We examine whether parents are able to recognise a new species as a danger to their young and counteract to nest failure by removing a slug. We also inquire whether parents can instantly recognise that a chick is dead from watching its injuries and a slug feeding on it. Finally, we analyse if the recognition that nestlings are dead comes along with parent's understanding of losing a brood. The most striking result of our study is that none of Blackcap parents reacted aggressively against a predator that was absolutely harmless to adults and small enough to be removed from a nest. We also describe other irrational behaviours like incubating dead chicks or bringing food to a nest by a parent that previously had removed all dead chicks from the nest and left it empty. Although our sample is rather limited, the study presents clear evidence that small passerines cannot use deduction even in very obvious situations.
