Diaspores and phyto-remains accidentally transported to the Antarctic Station during three expeditions
Abstract The aim of the project was to assess the size and species range of alien plant diaspores and phyto-remains transported into the Polish Antarctic Station during three Antarctic expeditions. Our study clearly demonstrates that many diaspores can be quite easily unintentionally transported in good conditions to the Antarctic. In the analyzed material there were present diaspores of invasive species. All identified species belong to 20 families. The most abundant were Asteraceae and Poaceae species. The most interesting finding was the presence of caryopses of Poa annua, the first alien angiosperm species which already established a stable breeding population in the Antarctic. Base on our results, we can predict that risk of establishment of anther alien plant species in the vicinity of ''Arctowski'' Station is very high.
