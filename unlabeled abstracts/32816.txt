Consumption of the eggs, hatchlings, and tadpoles of Green Frogs (Lithobates clamitans) by native and non-native predators
Abstract Predation by native and non-native predators on the eggs, embryos, and early stage tadpoles can affect the recruitment of offspring into a population. We examined the effects of native (Little Brown Mudbugs, Cambarus thomai; overwintered Rana tadpoles; Common Green Darner, Anax junius, larvae) and non-native (Western Mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis) potential predators on the eggs, hatchlings, and early tadpoles of the Green Frog (Lithobates clamitans). The predators had no effect on survivorship or hatching of L. clamitans eggs. However, tadpole survivorship was significantly reduced by dragonfly larvae and crayfish, but not G. affinis or the overwintered ranid tadpoles. Our observation that invertebrates consumed Green Frog tadpoles while vertebrates did not is consistent with palatability contributing to the tadpoles' susceptibility to different predators. Our results therefore suggest Green Frog tadpoles, but not eggs or embryos, from some populations may be subject to differential predation by invertebrate and vertebrate predators.
