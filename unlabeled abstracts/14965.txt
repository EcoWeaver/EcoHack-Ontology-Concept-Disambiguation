Photosynthesis and growth adaptation of Pterocarya stenoptera and Pinus elliottii seedlings to submergence and drought
To uncover the adaptation capacities of two flooding-tolerant plant species, Pterocarya stenoptera (a native species) and Pinus elliottii (an exotic species from southeastern USA), to alternating submergence and drought, we investigated their physiological and growth responses to water stress. Water treatments, including control, continuous flooding (CF), and periodic flooding and drought (PF), were applied to the seedlings to simulate water level fluctuation in the hydrofluctuation zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir region. Results showed that net photosynthetic rate (P N), stomatal conductance, and intrinsic water-use efficiency of both plant species seedlings were negatively affected under CF and PF compared to the corresponding controls. The P N of both species in PF was comparable to that in CF. At the end of the experiment, the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 concentration was not statistically different among water treatments, while that of P. elliottii was significantly higher than that of P. stenoptera. Although P. stenoptera formed lenticels under flooding conditions, P. elliottii seedlings allocated more mass to leaf and increased the relative growth rate of height to enhance the photosynthetic efficiency. These results illustrated that P. stenoptera and P. elliottii seedlings developed different adaptive strategies to respond to continuous flooding and periodic flooding and drought events. Therefore, both P. stenoptera and P. elliottii are promising candidates for the vegetation reconstruction of the riparian zones in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region.
