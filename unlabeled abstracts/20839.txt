Multiple introductions determine the genetic structure of an invasive species population: American mink Neovison vison in Poland
Genetic diversity of feral and ranch American mink was studied in order to understand the processes of invasion and the possible influence of multiple introductions on the feral mink population in Poland. Tissue samples obtained from feral mink taken from 10 sites across Poland (196) and from ranch mink at nine mink farms (147) were genotyped at 14 microsatellite loci. Genetic differentiation among the separate regions and sites indicated some restriction in gene flow among them (pairwise FST values), and greater variation at microsatellite loci for feral mink was attributed to differences among sites rather than among regions (AMOVA). A Mantel test demonstrated a positive association of pairwise genetic and geographic distances. A total of five clusters of feral mink were identified and their spatial distribution partially reflected regional distribution, but also suggested that there were other factors (human-mediated propagule pressure) shaping mink genetic structure. Feral and ranch mink belong to two genetically separate clusters and an assignment test showed that 34 feral mink (17%) were assigned to the ranch mink clusters. The proportion of feral mink assigned to ranch mink clusters correlated with the size of the farm breeding stocks in the districts where sampling sites were located. High human-mediated propagule pressure (particularly in western Poland) increases feral population genetic diversity and overwhelms genetic structure and potential management units, making the control of mink populations less successful. Our results indicate that reducing number of escapees from farms should be required management action.
