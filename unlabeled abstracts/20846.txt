Microsatellite evidence of invasion and rapid spread of divergent New Zealand mudsnail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) clones in the Snake River basin, Idaho, USA
We used microsatellites to assess genetic diversity and spatial structuring of the invasive apomictic New Zealand mudsnail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in the initial focal area of its recent North American invasion, a portion of the upper Snake River basin (Idaho) that is segmented by a series of hydropower dams. Thirty-four samples (812 total snails) from a 368km reach of this drainage were genotyped for six loci. Sixty-five distinct clones were detected and grouped into four divergent clusters based on chord distances. Genetic structuring of populations was generally low. Our results indicate that the founding population(s) of this invasion was composed of a small number of putative clonal lineages which spread rapidly within this fragmented watershed owing to the enhanced dispersal ability of these parthenogens. The substantial genetic variation documented in this study suggests that caution should be used in the application of biological control measures for this pest species.
