Distribution characteristic of invasive alien plants in Jeju Island
Background: This study was undertaken to analyze the distribution and ecological characteristics of invas ive alien plant species on Jeju Island, and to provide basic data for their management and control. Results: A field research was conducted at 436 locations on Jeju Island. The field research identified nine species of invasive alien species growing on Jeju Island. Based on the distribution pattern, Hypochaeris radicata L., Rumex acetosella, and Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. were found to be distributed horizontally throughout Jeju Island, with vertical growth in two or more vegetation zones, from warm temperate to the subalpine zone. Widely distributed species penetrate various habitats, such as grasslands, ranches, roadsides, farmlands, and empty lots, and have an immensely negative impac t on the ecosystem, including declining biodiversity on Jeju Island. Paspalum distichum var. indutum Shinners, Paspalum distichum L., Solanum carolinense L., and Aster pilosus Willd. were distributed in some areas as a biased distribution specie s, whereas Lactuca scariola L. and Solidago altissima L. were found only in certain areas as centralized distribution species. Conclusions: The centralized distribution species and biased distribution species of the invasive plants in the ecosystem of Jeju Island should be physically eliminated, keeping in mind the short- and mid-term perspectives and monitoring, and by considering expansion of additional distribution areas. Due to limitations of physical/ chemical elimination, time, and cost, widely distributed species require to be eliminated and managed, mainly to restore the integrity of the ecosyste m, by planting native species to reestablish the habitat.
