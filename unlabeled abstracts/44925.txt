Predation on green sea turtle, Chelonia mydas, hatchlings by invasive rats
We used camera traps to identify invasive Rattus rattus as predators at a green sea turtle nest, Chelonia mydas, in French Polynesia. The footage shows that the hatchlings are a familiar food source for rats and that the control of invasive rats has to be considered for the protection of endangered green sea turtles.
