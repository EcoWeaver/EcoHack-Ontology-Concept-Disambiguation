Global invasive potential of the house crow Corvus splendens based on ecological niche modelling
Summaries of recent rapid range expansions shown by the house crow Corvus splendens have provided insights into the global nature of this invasion process, but its long-term potential has not yet been evaluated. To explore the potential dimensions of this geographic expansion, we used ecological niche modeling based on known occurrences of the species on its native distributional area, in the context of GIS data sets describing climatic variables, topographic information, and human presence. Our models provided predictions of areas already invaded that were statistically significantly more coincident than expected under random (null) models. The predicted potential range of the species includes areas already affected, as well as potentially suitable areas in Central America, the Caribbean, equatorial and West Africa, and mainland and insular Southeast Asia, not yet colonized.
