Socioeconomic Value and Growth of Naturalized Musa balbisiana L. A. Colla Leaves in Honduras
Socioeconomic Value and Growth of Naturalized Musa balbisiana L. A. Colla Leaves in Honduras. Musa balbisiana (Musaceae) is a seed-producing diploid banana indigenous to Southeast Asia. After it was introduced to Honduras it became naturalized in nearby second-growth areas of the north coast. Local residents were quick to recognize the socioeconomic value of these wild banana leaves as a wrap for traditional nacatamales. To estimate the monetary value and to provide preliminary data on sustainable harvest of these leaves, interviews and field research were undertaken in 2009. From July to September of that year, each of 38 harvesters averaged a weekly sale of 4,400 cut, de-veined, and blanched M. balbisiana leaves. This weekly harvest sold for Lempiras (Lps.) 550.00 or ca. U.S. $30.00 to truckers, who transported them to major markets. The number of leaves produced in three months was estimated by two techniques: 1) The traditional cut of the entire pseudostem and 2) a careful cut to only remove useful leaves. The number of useful leaves cut at the onset of the study and three months later was 11 and 13 for techniques 1 and 2, respectively. This difference was not significant, but the more careful method did yield significantly wider, longer, and a greater number of total leaves (useful plus immature). This is the first field study to estimate leaf production by naturalized M. balbisiana plants in Honduras. All leaves are currently harvested from wild populations and no sustainable management plans exist. The socioeconomic value and cultural use of M. balbisiana leaves in Honduras is an example of an exotic species that has important socioeconomic benefits. This naturalized Musa appears to have few of the negative impacts typically attributed to exotic plants.
