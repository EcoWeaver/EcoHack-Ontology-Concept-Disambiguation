Reproductive features of the non-native Siganus luridus (Teleostei, Siganidae) during early colonization at Linosa Island (Sicily Strait, Mediterranean Sea)
In July 2003, the finding of a newly settled population of Siganus luridus at Linosa Island (Sicily Strait, Mediterranean Sea) gave us the unusual opportunity to examine the reproductive condition of a Lessepsian migrant during early phases of colonization. Aspects of gonad morphology, fecundity, atresia and oocyte dynamics were investigated by using 43 pioneer specimens collected in concomitance with their first record in the Pelagie Islands. Ovarian development was consistent with the group-synchronous type, and testicular organization was of the unrestricted spermatogonial testis type, with cystic spermatogenesis. Both males and females had reached final stages of gonad maturation. The rates of follicular atresia were moderate: out of 17 adult females, 10 individuals did not present atretic oocytes; six exhibited <15.1% of secondary growth phase (SGP) oocytes in a-atresia, while one female presented 45.7% of SGP in a-atresia. Fecundity estimates did not diverge from what was observed in a reference population along the Lebanese coast. Absolute fecundity ranged from 115 739 to 740 433 oocytes per female (16.5-24.5 cm LT). Relative fecundity ranged from 1239 to 3162 oocytes g)1, with a mean of 1885 +- 868 oocytes g)1. Our observations indicated that these early settled siganids are reproductively active at Linosa and suggested the forthcoming of self-maintaining populations across the central Mediterranean area.
