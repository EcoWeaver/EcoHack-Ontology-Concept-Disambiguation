An auto-contamination trap-strips system for biological control of Hyphantria cunea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), an invasive pest in China
The fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae), is a major invasive pest in China, where it seriously threatens fruit and ornamental trees and windbreak systems. An auto-contamination trap-strips system was designed to disseminate Beauveria bassiana for biological control. The standard trap consisted of a yellow or green trap with a width no larger than 30 cm and with B. bassiana inside it. Therefore, the trap-strips provided an appropriate microenvironment for the fall webworm to pupate, and an acceptable humidity for B. bassiana to infect and reproduce. The average infection rates of the trap-strips systems were more than 90%. The present study demonstrated a practical application of how physical and biological control of this pest can be conducted efficiently and economically.
