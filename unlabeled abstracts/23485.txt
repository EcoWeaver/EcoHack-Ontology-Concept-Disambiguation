The science and politics of ecological risk: bioinvasions policies in the US and Australia
The US and Australia - western democracies with similar histories of public awareness on environmental issues and broadly comparable records of policy and regulatory action to safeguard environmental quality - have responded differently to one of the newest and most significant threats to marine bioidiversity: that of biological invasions mediated by the ballast water of commercial shipping. Each country has framed the same invasion risks differently for the purposes of policy and regulation: Australia has decided to use a more narrowly circumscribed, target-species-based approach whereas US policy and regulation takes a more comprehensive and precautionary approach. These somewhat surprising national regulatory choices are traced to differences in the structure of each country's process for ballast policy decision making and most importantly to the policy role of ecological expertise within this process.
