New promising alien species of yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolia (Roepp. et Endl.) H. Robinson) for medicinal plant cultivation in Ukraine
Available to man source of bioactive compounds and minerals are plants. One of the promising crops is yakon that was introduced and put into culture in many countries. Perspective for Ukraine exotic species, which yakon belongs to, was recently started to grow in our country. The main area of yakon distribution is average latitude of South America. Due to the content of chlorogenic, coffee acids and other phenolic compounds in leaves yakon has antioxidant properties. Root tubers of yakon contain inulin -- a polysaccharide that is easily absorbed by the body and serves as a substitute for sugar in the diets of diabetic patients. In recent years, scientists from different countries have been studying yakon hypoglycemic properties. Researchers worldwide proved that the content of important biologically active compounds and chemical composition of yakon grown under different conditions vary quite strongly. So our goal was to find the optimal soil and climatic conditions for growing exotic species and identify favorable conditions for the accumulation of macro and micronutrients. This paper defines the contents of 23 chemical elements in the leaves, roots, tubers and root peel of yakon. A high content of vital macro and trace elements, including selenium was found out. Gray forest ashed, roughly silty, easily loam soil was found to be the most suitable for growing exotic species new for Ukraine Polymnia sonchifolia Poepp. & Endl., from which the highest yield -- 3.5 kg weight of underground parts (root tubers and rootstock) of the plant was obtained.
