New records of the five alien species from the flora of United Arab Emirates
During floristic research in 2017-2022 in the Emirate of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the authors discovered new alien species that complement the species composition of the flora of vascular plants in the Emirate and the UAE as a whole. The article presents new records of five alien species previously unknown from the flora of UAE and Fujairah: Gomphrena serrata L. (Amaranthaceae), Portulaca pilosa L., P. grandiflora Hook., P. umbraticolaKunth (Portulacaceae), and Peperomia pellucida (L.) Kunth (Piperaceae). Gomphrena serrata which is rare in the country was found only in one place in the mountainous region of Fujarah, and it is a novelty for the flora of the Arabian Peninsula as a whole, while Portulaca pilosa was observed in several different areas of Fujairah Emirate and is also known for Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Oman. Peperomia pellucida was found only in a single locality in the "Alamarey plant nursery" in Dibba town but in large number of individuals. For every species, synonyms, overall distribution, habitat preferences, affinity and taxonomic remarks as well as the list of localities are given. The herbarium materials were deposited in the Herbarium of the Komarov Botanical Institute (LE, Saint-Petersburg, Russia), duplicates were sent to the Herbarium of Altai State University (ALTB, Barnaul, Russia) and the Scientific Herbarium of Fujairah (FSH, Wadi Wuraya National Park, Fujairah, UAE).
