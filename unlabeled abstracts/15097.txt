Influence of different landscape design styles on plant invasions in Central Europe
When considering the most frequent invasive exotic plants on an international scale, it is evident that the majority are ornamentals and that they were deliberately introduced in relation to landscape design. Although there are worldwide numerous lists of invasive exotic plants--which means plants that have harmful effects on native biodiversity--an assessment of the contribution of different landscape design styles on plant invasions has not been done. We used the extensive database on the history of introduction and naturalization of alien plants into natural habitats of Central Europe (Lohmeyer and Sukopp, Agriophyten in der Vegetation Mitteleuropas in: Schriftenreihe Vegetationskunde 25, 1992; Nachtrag: Braunschweiger Geobotan Arbeiten 8:179-220, 2001) to examine how many alien ornamental plants there are in the different natural habitats; and how many of them are invasive exotic plants and--in contrast--how many have not spread significantly. Also, we researched contributions by different landscape design styles to these plant invasions since medieval times. Of the estimated 12,000 alien plant species introduced into Central Europe since the Neolithic period, 279 taxa (2.3 %) are currently identified as being naturalized in natural habitats; 103 (0.86 %) of these naturalized taxa are ornamentals, and of these, 40 (0.33 %) are invasive exotic plants. Our investigation has shown a correlation between the frequency of plant invasions and changes in landscape-design styles. Evaluating the impact of plant invasions through horticulture and landscape design on native biodiversity, our study illustrates that it is significantly lower in Central Europe than in other parts of the world.
