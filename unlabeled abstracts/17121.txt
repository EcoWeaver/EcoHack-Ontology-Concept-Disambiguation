What's in a name? Taxonomy and nomenclature of invasive gobies in the Great Lakes and beyond
The species identities, scientic names, and relationships of Eurasian gobies that invaded the Laurentian Great Lakes - and other species that are predicted to invade in the future - are evaluated here using recently resolved DNA characters. The Round Goby and the Freshwater Tubenose Goby entered the Great Lakes ca. 1990 via ballast water originating from Black Sea ports. The Round Goby spread extensively throughout the Great Lakes and adjacent rivers, whereas the Freshwater Tubenose Goby recently began to expand its range. Both species also are widely invasive in Eurasia, dispersing via canals and shipping. Several of their relatives - the Monkey, Racer, and Bighead gobies - also are invasive in Eurasia, and are predicted to invade the Great Lakes. We discuss results from phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences from 4 mitochondrial and nuclear gene regions, and provide a revision of their scientic nomenclature. The Freshwater Tubenose Goby was redened as Proterorhinus semilunaris, which is markedly different and distinctive from the Marine Tubenose Goby Proterorhinus marmoratus. The genus Neogobius, as formerly dened, contained multiple evolutionary lineages and incorrect scientic names. We thus restricted Neogobius to just 4 species--including the Round Goby Neogobius melanostomus and the Black Sea Monkey Goby Neogobius uviatilis. Several previously recognized subgenera, which were incorrectly grouped in Neogobius, were elevated to the level of genera. Notably, the Racer Goby became Babka gymnocephalus and the Bighead Goby now is Ponticola kessleri. These changes made the names consistent with their true relationships and species characters, which are essential for identifying and character-izing these gobies in invasive and native habitats.
