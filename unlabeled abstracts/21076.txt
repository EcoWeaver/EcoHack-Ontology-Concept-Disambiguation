Sampling across space and time to validate natural experiments: an example with ant invasions in Hawaii
Measuring the impacts of invasive species on recipient biotic communities can be challenging because standard ecological field experiments may be impossible, undesirable or inaccurate due to limitations of scale. Many studies therefore rely on a comparative observational approach, in which invaded areas are compared to similar nearby uninvaded areas, but this approach suffers from reduced inferential power because of the inability to randomly assign treatments. When possible, the best solution may be to incorporate comparative sampling over time, from before and after invasion, as a means of validating comparisons across space. We used this approach to assess the impacts of Argentine and big-headed ants on arthropod communities at two natural area sites in the Hawaiian Islands. Two sampling events, separated by 2years, indicated that invaded plots at each site were significantly different from uninvaded plots in terms of overall community composition and distributions of certain indicator species. This compositional change associated with ant invasion was accompanied by a significant decrease in arthropod species richness at one site, but not at the second site. Changes in arthropod communities from before invasion to after invasion in separate before-after plots at each site were qualitatively consistent with the aforementioned changes measured across the invasion boundaries, but were smaller in magnitude because the invasion processes were still in early stages. Together, these findings support the inference that carefully planned studies of biological invasions that use a comparative observational approach can provide an accurate picture of resultant community level changes, and illustrate an effective method for validating such studies.
