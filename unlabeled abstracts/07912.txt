Cephrenes trichopepla (Lower, 1908): An invasive Australian species, recorded in Sri Lanka for the first time with notes on its biology, life history and distribution (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae)
Cephrenes trichopepla (Lower, 1908), an invasive Australian species, was recorded for the first time in Sri Lanka in July 2009 but it is likely to have been in the island much longer. Since then, it has been recorded in several locations in the Northwestern province, near Colombo in the Western province, and in Kandy in the Central province. Recorded larval food plants are coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, a widely cultivated plantation crop, and a species of Livistona, a cultivated garden palm (Arecaceae). The immature stages and behavior in Sri Lanka are documented for the first time.
