Metabolic characteristics of early life history stages of native marble trout (Salmo marmoratus ) and introduced brown trout (Salmo trutta ) and their hybrids in the Soca River
Metabolic potential and respiration rate have been measured in the early life stages of native marble trout Salmo marmoratus (MT), introduced brown trout Salmo trutta (BT) and their hybrids (MH = female of MT 9 male of BT and BH = female of BT 9 male of MT) to examine the differences in their metabolic characteristics. Metabolic potential and respiration rate were lowest in each developmental stage in MT, followed by MH, BT and BH. The ratio between metabolic potential and respiration rate (ETS/R) in larvae was also lowest for MT (1.0) and MH (1.1), followed by BT (1.4) and BH (1.6), indicating more intensive exploitation of metabolic potential for actual respiration in MT (100%) and MH (~90%) than in BT (~70%) and BH (~60%). Lower ETS/R means a disadvantage in the case of enhanced metabolic activity due to insufficient enzyme machinery needed for energy production. Thus, potential and actual metabolic activity and ETS/R ratio could account for the different competitive abilities among pure trout species and their hybrids in a particular environment. This is the first report on biochemical and physiological differences between pure MT and their hybrids. The combination of metabolic and respiration rate measurements appears to be a useful tool for estimating the metabolic properties in the early developmental stages of fish.
