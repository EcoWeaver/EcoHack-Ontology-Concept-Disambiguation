Feeding ecology of the invasive round goby, Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), based on laboratory size preference and field diet in different habitats in the western basin of Lake Erie
The round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, is an invasive benthic fish species in the Laurentian Great Lakes that is threatening native fish populations through competition, predation, and trophic dynamic change. This study examined the trophic dynamic plasticity of round goby along a depth gradient based on laboratory and field observations to determine prey species consumed and mussel prey size selection. Prey size selection in the laboratory was assessed by presenting individual round goby with quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) of various class sizes (i.e., 6.0- 9.9 mm, 10.0- 12.9 mm, 13.0- 15.9 mm, and 16.0- 18.9 mm in length). Round goby exhibited a selection preference for small sized quagga mussels, although in individual trial events, mussels were consumed from all four size classes. Prey species consumed from shallow and deep sites in the western basin of Lake Erie were assessed using individual gut contents to calculate measures of prey importance, diversity, and dominance. Based on the Index of Relative Importance (IRI), Cladocera was found to be the most consumed prey item for both males and females and between study sites. Both sexes consumed a variety of prey items although females exhibited greater prey dominance or reliance on one prey item. Round goby individuals at the shallow, natural shoreline site had the highest trophic diversity, while individuals at the deep site exhibited the highest prey dominance. Diet of round goby in the western basin of Lake Erie are mainly dominated by just a few prey items.
