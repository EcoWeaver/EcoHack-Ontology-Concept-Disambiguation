Invasive plant species in the forest parks of Yekaterinburg
Abstract Invasive species - introduced species, spontaneously settled outside their natural range, and successfully adapted to the new growing conditions. The problem of invasive species penetration, both herbaceous and woody, has long been a concern of scientists, their views on this issue being contradictory. In the forest parks of Yekaterinburg there is a significant number of introduced species - invasive species. The occurrence of invasive species was considered in three forest parks of the city. The article shows invasive species high occurrence, wide amplitude of ecological plasticity, lack of response to shade density conditions in forest parks and urban plantations. They easily adapt to the conditions of different shade density and increased recreational load, both in urban areas plantations and in the conditions of a forest park. The studied species can be recommended for use in urban parks and forest parks. Cotoneaster lucidus Schlecht. and Amelanchier spicata (Lam.) K. Koch. are quite decorative and can be used both in the formation of edges, landscape groups and as undergrowth species.
