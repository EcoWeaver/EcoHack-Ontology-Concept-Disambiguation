Food Resource Partitioning between Two Invasive Gobiid Species (Pisces, Gobiidae) in the Littoral Zone of the River Danube, Hungary
At present, the invasive round and bighead gobies are the most abundant benthic fish species in the near shore zone of the Middle Danube. We compared their diet seasonally in natural and artificial habitats and contrasted it with the food supply. The composition of the macroinvertebrate community was determined mainly by seasonal changes, whereas habitat type had smaller effect. Round gobies followed these changes flexibly. They consumed mainly chironomids in the spring, whilst amphipods and molluscs in the summer and autumn. Bighead gobies relied on amphipods in each season and in both habitats, and consumed fish, too, including round goby (intraguild predation). Diet overlap was determined by the morphological differences of the species allowing a varying degree of differentiation according to the seasonally changing food supply.
