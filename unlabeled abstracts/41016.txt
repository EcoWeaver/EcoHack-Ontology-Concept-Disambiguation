Individual variation influences avoidance behaviour of invasive common carp (
Uncontrolled biological invasions are reducing freshwater ecosystem diversity and resilience. Research is needed to evaluate whether non-structural deterrents are feasible within lock or canal environments. This study examined common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and buffalo hybrid (Ictiobus) movement patterns in response to acoustic and stroboscopic deterrents. Twelve strobe lights and one underwater speaker were deployed across the centre of a ship slip, with an environment analogous to a navigation canal. Common carp (n = 6) and Ictiobus (n = 4) were implanted with acoustic telemetry tags, and their behaviours were examined under control, stroboscopic, and acoustic stimuli for 60-min trial periods. Trials were run during the day and night for six straight days. Linear models determined that the stroboscopic and acoustic stimuli altered fish positioning within the ship slip, but produced weaker avoidance responses than those observed elsewhere. Weak responses were likely due to a strong preference for the open end of the ship slip and a lack of acoustic refuge during the acoustic treatment. Avoidance responses also differed widely among individuals of the same species, with fish expressing repeatability of avoidance radius size across trials. Ambient and stimulus sound-pressure levels should be carefully considered when deploying acoustic deterrents.
