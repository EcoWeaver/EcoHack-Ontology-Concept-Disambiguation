Phenology of native weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in New Zealand pastures and parasitism by the introduced braconid,Microctonus aethiopoidesLoan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)
The phenology of native brachycerine weevil species at seven pasture sites in Otago, Canterbury and Waikato was studied by regular quantitative sampling of adults. Weevils were identified to species, and dissected to record reproductive status and parasitism by introduced braconid parasitoids in the genus Microctonus. Climatic data assisted in the interpretation of some population density patterns. Weevil population density was estimated for periods of two to five years at the selected sites. Species in the Entimini (species of Irenimus and Nicaeana) were generally univoltine, with adults emerging in winter-spring. The main period of reproductive activity was spring, and parasitism by Microctonus aethiopoides reached its highest incidence in January. Low level parasitism of native weevil species by M. aethiopoides was detected at all sites, and by M. hyperodae at two sites. At one site in Otago, parasitism by M. aethiopoides was higher and could have affected the population density of Irenimus aemulator (Broun) and Nicaeana sp. Most parasitism occurred after the main reproductive period of weevils in spring, but a putative second generation in some species might be more affected by parasitoid attack. A native rhytirhinine species, Steriphus variabilis, differed from the entimines because adults emerged in autumn and spring, and may be bivoltine. Mechanisms of M. aethiopoides parasitism of non-target species in the field are discussed.
