Invasive species and global climate change
Abstract This book is part of the "CABI Invasive Series", which addresses all topics relating to invasive species, including biosecurity surveillance, mapping and modelling, economics of invasive species and species interactions in plant invasions. Aimed at researchers, upper-level students and policy makers, titles in the series provide international coverage of topics related to invasive species, including both a synthesis of facts and discussions of future research perspectives and possible solutions. This book specifically aims to examine the nexus of climate change and biological invasions, and the resulting impacts, and to identify means to reduce the vulnerability and increase the resiliency of managed and unmanaged ecosystems. It is divided into four parts: (i) the dimensions of the problem: background and science; (ii) case studies; (iii) management: detection and prevention; and (iv) management: control and adaptation.
