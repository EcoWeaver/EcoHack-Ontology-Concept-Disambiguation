No evolution of reduced resistance and compensation for psyllid herbivory by the invasive Genista monspessulana
The evolution of redirecting resources from plant defense to growth or reproduction may explain why some exotic species are successful invaders in new environments. For example, the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis posits that escape from herbivores by invasive plants results in the selection of more vigorous genotypes that reduce their allocation of resources to defense. In addition, understanding the defense strategy of an invasive plant may help forecast the likely impact of herbivory. We tested the prediction of reduced defense (i.e., resistance) in Genista monspessulana, measured indirectly as the performance of a specialist psyllid herbivore, by comparing five native and introduced plant populations. We also examined the ability of G. monspessulana to compensate for herbivory in the presence and the absence of psyllids for a single plant population from the native and introduced regions. Plant origin (native or introduced) did not influence the psyllid's abundance and population growth rate, suggesting no change in resistance to herbivory for introduced plants. Similarly, we found no overall difference in plant performance between individuals in the presence and the absence of psyllid herbivory, suggesting that G. monspessulana was able to fully compensate for herbivory. Damaged plants compensated by changing the pattern of branching, which also resulted in greater dry leaf biomass. We conclude that evolution of reduced defenses does not explain the success of G. monspessulana as an invader and that compensation for herbivory may limit the efficacy of the psyllid as a biological control agent.
