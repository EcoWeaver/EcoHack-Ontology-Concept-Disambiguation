First record of Ornithonyssus bursa (Berlese, 1888) (Mesostigmata: Macronyssidae) parasitizing invasive monk parakeets in Santiago, Chile
Abstract Myiopsitta monachus is an invasive psittacine with wide distribution due to the pet trade. Its large communal nests and synanthropic nature contribute to its successful colonization of cities, from where it seems to be expanding in range and numbers. This is relevant with regard to pathogens that invasive species may harbor, especially when host populations thrive. We aimed to identify an abundant mite found in invasive monk parakeet chicks that had been collected in Santiago during 2017 and 2018. Through morphological and molecular identification of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene, we confirmed the presence of Ornithonyssus bursa. This was the first report of this mite in Chile. This mite is common in native and invasive monk parakeet populations and may affect other birds, including domestic fowl. Further, this mite bites people and can be a potential vector of pathogens such as bacteria or viruses. We conclude that this parasite was likely introduced with the parakeet and discuss possible ecological, health and economic consequences of this new potential pest.
