Compliant lightweight non-invasive standalone "Marine Skin" tagging system
Current marine research primarily depends on weighty and invasive sensory equipment and telemetric network to understand the marine environment, including the diverse fauna it contains, as a function of animal behavior and size, as well as equipment longevity. To match animal morphology and activity within the surrounding marine environment, here we show a physically flexible and stretchable skin-like and waterproof autonomous multifunctional system, integrating Bluetooth, memory chip, and high performance physical sensors. The sensory tag is mounted on a swimming crab (Portunus pelagicus) and is capable of continuous logging of depth, temperature, and salinity within the harsh ocean environment. The fully packaged, ultra-lightweight (<2.4 g in water), and compliant "Marine Skin" system does not have any wired connection enabling safe and weightless cutting-edge approach to monitor and assess marine life and the ecosystem's health to support conservation and management of marine ecosystems. A cost-effective multi-sensory tag system has been developed by integrating wireless communication, high performance physical sensors and conformal packaging for marine research. A collaborative team led by Prof Muhammad Hussain from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia designs a non-invasive, wireless, lightweight epidermal multisensory tag with long deployment lifetime for marine research applications. To show the non-invasive and lightweight features of the "Marine Skin" tags, they test their long term temperature, pressure, salinity and their cross-sensitivity on the crustaceans in Red Sea water for more than 20 days. The sensory tags can be tailored for a diversity of animals of irregular size and shape due to the non-invasiveness and conformality of the functional circuits and packaging materials. They enable cost-effective solutions for long term monitoring and measuring.
