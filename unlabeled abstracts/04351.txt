First record of Aedes albopictus (Skuse 1894) on Sao tome island
Biological invasions have critical impacts on native biodiversity and human societies and especially on oceanic islands that are fragile and threatened ecosystems. The invasive tiger mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse, 1894) native to Southeast Asia has been introduced during the past 30 years almost everywhere in the world, including the Americas, the Pacific, Europe and Africa. It has been reported for the first time in the Gulf of Guinea in 2000, first in Cameroon, then in Bioko Island in 2003 and more recently in Gabon in 2007. Here we report the first record of Ae. albopictus on Sao Tome Island. Although we cannot estimate precisely the year of introduction on Sao Tome Island, it most likely arrived within the last 10 years. By sequencing the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene from individual adults, we detected three haplotypes already present in mainland Africa. More studies are needed to explore the dynamics of its expansion and competition with insular native mosquitoes.
