Reaping benefits from an invasive species: role of Harmonia axyridis in natural biological control of Aphis glycines in North America
Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is an invasive species present in numerous agroecosystems in North America. Despite adverse impacts as a threat to native biodiversity, a nuisance household invader and a pest in fruit production, H. axyridis also plays a beneficial role as a major component of assemblages of generalist predators in several agricultural crops. Here, we review the role of H. axyridis as a natural enemy of Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), an invasive pest of soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merrill (Fabales: Fabaceae), in North America. Harmonia axyridis is often the most abundant predator species attacking A. glycines in soybean agroecosystems. This predator has the potential to both prevent and suppress A. glycines outbreaks. Further studies are needed to fully understand and utilize the potential of H. axyridis as a natural enemy in the management of A. glycines and other agricultural pests in agroecosystems worldwide.
