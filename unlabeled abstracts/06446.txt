Association analysis between serotype, cry gene content, and toxicity to Helicoverpa armigera larvae among Bacillus thuringiensis isolates native to Spain.
Serotyping, cry gene content, and toxicity to Helicoverpa armigera were determined for 178 isolates of Bacillus thuringiensis native to Spain. A total of 13 different cry1 and cry2 genes were detected when isolates were screened by PCR analysis. Results showed that cry2 and cry1Ia were the most frequent cry genes in the collection (74 and 57%, respectively); whereas cry1D, cry1Aa, cry1Ab, and cry1C were only moderately abundant (49, 48, 47, and 36%, respectively). The most uncommon cry genes were cry1Ac, cry1E, cry1B, cry1Ib, cry1Ad, cry1F, and cry1G, with frequencies of 24, 14, 13, 8, 5, 5, and 1%, respectively. The distribution of some cry genes was somewhat associated with particular serovars. For example, genes cry1C and cry1D were especially frequent in the serovar aizawai, while cry1B was very frequent in the serovar thuringiensis. Bioassays against H. armigera larvae showed a wide variation in the insecticidal potency, even among strains sharing the same set of cry genes and within the same serotype.
