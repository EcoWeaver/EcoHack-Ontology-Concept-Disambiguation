Geographic expansion of a rust fungus on Plumeria in Pacific and Asian countries
Plumeria species, which are distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, are commonly cultivated as ornamental trees. From the late 1980s onwards, a rust disease of Plumeria spp. caused by Coleosporium plumeriae suddenly expanded to Pacific islands from its original distribution area in Central America. More recently, this disease has been reported from many countries of America, Oceania, Asia and Africa, and it causes severe damage to these trees. The history of its expansion in Pacific and Asian countries based on specimens and literature showed that the rust fungus has rapidly spread from east to west in Pacific countries and then south to north in Asian countries. It is suggested that this rapid expansion may be related to El Nino and La Nina events and typhoons, as well as anthropogenic factors such as movement of Plumeria flowers.
