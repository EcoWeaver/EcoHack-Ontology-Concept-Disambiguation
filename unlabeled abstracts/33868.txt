Does the American mink displace the European polecat? A need for more research on interspecific competition between invasive and native species
AbstractIntroduced alien species can negatively affect native competitors by reducing their populations or eliminating them from ecosystems. However, studies do not always find evidence for anticipated impacts, and changes in native populations can be difficult to estimate. Interactions between the invasive American mink Neovison vison and native European polecat Mustela putorius have been studied in several countries, but the mink's impact on polecat populations at a large spatiotemporal scale remains unclear. In the years 1995-2018, we live-trapped mink and polecats at 60 study sites in Poland, and we analysed hunting bags of mink and polecats from the years 2009-2018. During 13,766 trap-nights, we captured 905 individuals. Mink comprised 91.2% and polecats 8.8% of trapped animals. The mean mink and polecat trappability was 6 and 0.6 individuals per 100 trap-nights, respectively. At rivers, polecat and mink trappability were negatively correlated, whereas at lakes, they were not correlated. The sex ratio of trapped polecats was more skewed toward males than that of mink. Mink comprised 63.6% and polecats 36.4% of 59,831 animals killed by hunters. Over 10 years, the numbers of mink shot annually increased slightly, whereas the numbers of polecat decreased slightly. There was a positive correlation between numbers of mink and polecats shot annually. We found weak evidence that at a large spatiotemporal scale, the invasion of mink has led to a decline in polecat numbers. Although the datasets we analysed were based on large samples, they were insufficient to show evidence of competitive interactions between these two mustelids.
