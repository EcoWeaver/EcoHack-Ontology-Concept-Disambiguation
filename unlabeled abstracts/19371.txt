Invasive species: reality or myth?
In view of the recent debate on the future of invasion biology, we argue that species could be regarded as invasive only when after adaptation in non-native habitats they reach yet another fitness maximum. We suggest that invasion biologists need to unambiguously clarify what constitutes being "invasive" to refute those who call for an end to invasion biology.
