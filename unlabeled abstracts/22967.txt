War of the weeds: Competition hierarchies in invasive species
Invasive plant species succeed because they are able to propagate and disperse into unoccupied habitat, outcompete and suppress other plant species or use a combination of these two strategies. Ecosystems are often invaded by multiple species and it is important to determine which species are likely to dominate plant communities through competition and which species will succeed by other means. We assessed frequency and abundance of 65 invasive species over 1700 km of riparian zone in the Burdekin catchment of North Queensland, Australia and established a dominance hierarchy for those species. The cover of every invasive and one native shrub known to have increased in abundance in historical times, was surveyed in quadrats as part of a nested hierarchical design consisting of 8030 quadrats, within 803 transects, within 90 sites. Total species cover and species frequency were derived from the results of this survey. We estimated the pairwise interactions between individual species and used a non-parametric David Score to rank species and construct a competition hierarchy of invasive species at the quadrat and transect levels. Species frequency and cover were highly correlated (r2 = 0.81). The competition hierarchy of species at the quadrat level was moderately related to species cover, but poorly related to species frequency (r2 = 0.24 and 0.02). The competition rank of many species, including Urochloa mosambicensis and Parthenium hysterophorus, changed markedly with scale when assessed at the quadrat and transect levels. This suggests different processes influenced their competitive success at different scales. This technique enabled us to explore and accept the hypothesis that abundant species are often the most competitive. However, some exceptions were identified in this study and these species may in time become more abundant in the catchment.
