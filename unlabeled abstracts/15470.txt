Seventy-five years of biodiversity decline of fish assemblages in Chinese isolated plateau lakes: widespread introductions and extirpations of narrow endemics lead to regional loss of dissimilarity
Introductions of exotic species have globally modified the structure and function of native assemblages and are recognized as one of the major threats to biodiversity. The current patterns, processes and consequences of invasion have been intensively studied globally, but studies reporting the long-term dynamics of invasions over large areas are rare. Here, we measured how the temporal changes in fish assemblage composition in a Chinese highland isolated-lake landscape drive taxonomic dissimilarity and its turnover component over three successive time periods spanning the last 75 years.
