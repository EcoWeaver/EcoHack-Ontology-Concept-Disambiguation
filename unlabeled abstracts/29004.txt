First record of the invasive species Rottboellia cochinchinensis (Poaceae, Andropogoneae) in the South Region of Brazil
Rottboellia cochinchinensis is an aggressive invasive species native to Asia. This species is known worldwide for invading crops and disturbed habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. In Brazil, R. cochinchinensis had its southernmost record in Sao Paulo state; however, in this study we expand its distribution to Santa Catarina state, in the South Region of Brazil, based on the discovery of a population in Blumenau municipality. These new records are ca. 440 km distant from the nearest known population, in Sao Paulo municipality, Sao Paulo state, Brazil.
