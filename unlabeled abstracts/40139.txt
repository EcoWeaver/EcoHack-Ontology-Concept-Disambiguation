Carbofuran affects behavior and metabolism of the Atlantic Forest lambari Deuterodon iguape, a native species from Brazil
One of the major causes of aquatic biodiversity loss is the contamination of the environment by pesticides. Even though there is a considerable amount of studies on the subject, there are still few that deal with the effects of carbofuran on native species in Brazil. Although carbofuran is widely used in Brazil, its action on native organisms, such as the Atlantic Forest lambari Deuterodon iguape, has not yet been studied. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of exposure to carbofuran on the fish D. iguape, considering the behavior and specific oxygen consumption as end points. Opercular movements, dorsal fin movements, and swimming speed were analyzed as behavioral parameters. To assess specific oxygen consumption, fish were subjected to concentrations of 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/L, for 24 h. For behavior analysis, fish remained exposed to carbofuran at concentrations of 0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mg/L, in periods of 0, 2, 24, and 48 h. The behavior was studied through filming, analyzed with the free software, Tracker 4.92 (Open Source Physics). The results demonstrate an increase in opercular movements (18% +- 2.65) and a decrease in dorsal fin movements (- 21.2% +- 2.97), as well as in swimming speed (- 58.3% +- 1.83) of the experimental groups compared to the control group. There was an increase in oxygen consumption of 58.4% in fish exposed to the highest concentration of carbofuran. Thus, it is concluded that carbofuran altered D. iguape's behavior and oxygen consumption. The species was sensitive to carbofuran concentrations and can be used as a bioindicator.
