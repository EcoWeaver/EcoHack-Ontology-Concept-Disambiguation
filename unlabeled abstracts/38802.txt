Model-based prediction of potential distribution of the invasive insect pest, spotted lanternfly Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae), by using CLIMEX
Lycorma delicatula is one of the major invasive pests of Korea. Careful monitoring is required to protect domestic agriculture as this pest causes severe damage to agricultural crops, such as wilting and sooty mold. This study was designed to confirm the potential distribution of L. delicatula using the modeling software CLIMEX and to suggest fundamental data for preventing agricultural damage by L. delicatula. CLIMEX is the main tool for evaluating the distribution and dispersion of L. delicatulaby utilizing local climate data and physiological information associated with this species. Our results show that Korean weather seems to be adequate for L. delicatula habitation, indicating that approximately 60% of areasexamined have a very high possibility of potential distribution. Particularly, we showed that Gyeongsang-do and Jeonla-do,which have not yet been invadedby L. delicatula,were very suitable locations for its growth. Therefore, while it is necessary to set up feasible strategies for preventing furtherL. delicatulainvasions, subsequent studies are needed for assessing other invasive species consideringthe impact of future climate change.
