Response to temperature and hypoxia in the oxygen consumption of the introduced asiatic freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea (Muller)
1.1. Respiratory response to temperature and hypoxia was determined for specimens of the introduced freshwater Asiatic clam, Corbicula fluminea (Muller).2.2. O2 uptake increases with temperature through 25degC in clams acclimated to 10, 20 or 30degC but is severely depressed above it.3.3. Clams acclimated to 10degC respond to hypoxia as strict O2 conformers while 20 and 30degC acclimated clams are less than strict conformers.4.4. Respiratory adaptation to high temperatures and hypoxia are not as well developed in C. ftuminea as other freshwater bivalve species, reflecting a more recent penetration of freshwater, and limiting its eventual distribution in North America.
