Population age structure and reproductive behavior of the monocarpic perennial Heracleum mantegazzianum (Apiaceae) in its native and invaded distribution ranges.
Many invasive species are benign in their native region-are there interactions between their key traits and the new habitats that explain invasion success? The giant perennial herb Heracleum mantegazzianum is a problematic invader in Europe and is also naturalized in North America. We compared its population structure and reproductive behavior in the native (W. Caucasus) and invaded (Czech Republic) areas in managed (pastures) and unmanaged sites. The age structure of the populations and age at flowering were analyzed using herb-chronology, a method based on counting annual rings in the secondary xylem of roots. The species was strictly monocarpic; most plants in unmanaged sites in the invaded range flowered in the third and fourth yr (maximum 12 yr). In unmanaged habitats, plants from the native range flowered later than those from the invaded range. In both ranges, flowering was delayed in managed sites where the population density was higher and most plants flowered around the fifth year. Reproductive output of individual plants was neither related to population density nor to age at flowering. More favorable climatic conditions in the invaded region, together with increased chances for dispersal in a densely colonized central Europe, seemed to allow the massive invasion.
