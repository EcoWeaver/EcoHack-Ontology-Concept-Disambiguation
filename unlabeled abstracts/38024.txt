Safety and efficacy of Virkon(r) aquatic as a control tool for invasive Molluscs in aquaculture
Virkon(r) Aquatic is a broad-spectrum disinfectant used in aquaculture as a disinfectant for footwear, nets, and equipment for protection from bacteria, viruses and one fungus. Recent studies provided data to support Virkon(r) Aquatic as a tool to kill invasive molluscs and other organisms in aquaculture and field settings. This study reports the efficacy of Virkon(r) Aquatic to kill New Zealand mudsnails Potamopyrgus antipodarum and quagga mussels Dreissena rostriformis bugensis from aquaculture facilities. To address the safety of Virkon(r) Aquatic used in aquaculture and field settings, the safety limits of Virkon(r) Aquatic to Steelhead trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were tested. Short-term emersion of fingerlings for up to 3.5 h in diluted concentrations of 30 mg/L showed no observable toxic effects. Smaller fry were somewhat less tolerant but survived exposures for up to 5 h in 10 mg/L. We conclude that the risks to fish are low if residues of the chemical remained on equipment, or if containers with disinfecting concentrations of 20 g/L were spilled into raceways or around fish holding systems. We suggest that this and additional studies may be helpful to support a label claim of this disinfectant for targeted invasive invertebrate species.
