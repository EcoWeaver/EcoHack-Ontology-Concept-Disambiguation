Improving management of invasive species: New Zealand's approach to pre- and post-border pests
Biological invasions are a ubiquitous global concern. Invasive species are non-native species that arrive in a new area, establish and increase in density and distribution to the detriment of the recipient environment. Such species that become invasive are a major threat to biodiversity (Vitousek and D'Antonio, 1997). Unlike inanimate risks, living things establish, reproduce and often spread, leading to enormous environmental and economic effects (Vila et al., 2010).
