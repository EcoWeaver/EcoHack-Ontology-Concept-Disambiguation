Non-native species have multiple abundance-impact curves
The abundance-impact curve is helpful for understanding and managing the impacts of non-native species. Abundance-impact curves can have a wide range of shapes (e.g., linear, threshold, sigmoid), each with its own implications for scientific understanding and management. Sometimes, the abundance-impact curve has been viewed as a property of the species, with a single curve for a species. I argue that the abundance-impact curve is determined jointly by a non-native species and the ecosystem it invades, so that a species may have multiple abundance-impact curves. Models of the impacts of the invasive mussel Dreissena show how a single species can have multiple, noninterchangeable abundance-impact curves. To the extent that ecosystem characteristics determine the abundance-impact curve, abundance-impact curves based on horizontal designs (space-for-time substitution) may be misleading and should be used with great caution, it at all. It is important for scientists and managers to correctly specify the abundance-impact curve when considering the impacts of non-native species. Diverting attention from the invading species to the invaded ecosystem, and especially to the interaction between species and ecosystem, could improve our understanding of how non-native species affect ecosystems and reduce uncertainty around the effects of management of populations of non-native species.
