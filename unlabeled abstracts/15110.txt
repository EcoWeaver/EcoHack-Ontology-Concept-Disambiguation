The role of waterfowl and fishing gear on zebra mussel larvae dispersal
The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas 1771), is an invasive freshwater species with major negative impacts, promoting changes in ecosystem structure and function and also contributing to economic losses. Navigation has been considered the primary vector of dispersion and little importance has been given to alternative natural (waterbirds) and other human vectors. Using an experimental approach under field conditions, we evaluated and compared zebra mussel dispersal potential by fishing gear (waders and keepnets) versus mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), by examining the adherence and survival rate of zebra mussel larvae on each vector. In addition, we evaluated the survival of zebra mussel larvae under desiccating conditions (i.e., a set of controlled temperatures and relative humidities). Larvae adhered to all types of vectors and survived desiccation under both laboratory and field conditions and thus appear able to be dispersed long distances overland by both ducks and fishing gear. Specifically, on a per-event basis, fishing gear has a higher potential to spread zebra mussel larvae than ducks. Survival was three times higher on human vectors and the number of larvae attached to human vectors was over double of that on the ducks. However, our findings demonstrate that natural vectors, like ducks, can contribute to the transport of zebra mussel larvae at a local scale. Nevertheless, since vectors related to human activity presented a higher potential for transport, it is imperative to continue campaigns to raise the awareness of anglers and boaters as well as continue the implementation of legislation to reduce the risk of zebra mussel dispersal.
