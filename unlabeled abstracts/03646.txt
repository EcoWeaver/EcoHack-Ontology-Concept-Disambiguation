Ambrosiella beaveri, sp. nov., associated with an exotic ambrosia beetle, Xylosandrus mutilatus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), in Mississippi, USA
Xylosandrus mutilatus is an Asian ambrosia beetle that has recently established in Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, and possibly Florida, USA. We investigated the fungi associated with the mycangia (specialized fungus-transporting structures) of X. mutilatus in Mississippi. Mycangia consistently yielded an Ambrosiella sp. which was subsequently found to be closely related to, but distinct from, other Ambrosiella species affiliated with Ceratocystis. This Ambrosiella is described herein as Ambrosiella beaveri sp. nov. Also isolated were Geosmithia lavendula, G. obscura, and a yeast, Candida homelintoma. It is likely Ambrosiella beaveri was introduced along with the beetle into North America.
