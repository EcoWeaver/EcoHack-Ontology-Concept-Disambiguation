Climatic and socio-economic factors determine the level of invasion by alien plants in Chile
Background: Economic activities are substantial factors in alien plant establishment and invasions. Climate also plays an important role in the distribution of alien species.Aims: We evaluate the relationship between alien species density and both climatic and socio-economic factors at the scale of provinces located in a latitudinal-bioclimatic gradient in Chile.Methods: We used generalised linear models with backward selection to evaluate the relative importance of each parameter (human population, gross domestic product, length of traffic routes, crop cover, abandoned crop cover, artificial plantations, protected areas, annual rainfall and temperature) on species density. We compared the average species density among climate types.Results: Alien density was higher for provinces located in the most populated areas with Mediterranean and temperate oceanic climates (south-central Chile) and decreased for less populated provinces in the north and the southernmost parts (desert and sub-Antarctic wetlands). Human population, length of traffic routes and annual rainfall significantly explained the variation in alien species density in Chile.Conclusions: Although human population still increases, the results can be used especially in high priority conservation areas where traffic routes and human settlements can be objectively reduced or managed, to reduce the potential increase in the number of alien species.
