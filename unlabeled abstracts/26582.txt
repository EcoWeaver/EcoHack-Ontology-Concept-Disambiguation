A necrotizing hepatopancreatitis (NHP) outbreak in a shrimp farm in Campeche, Mexico: A first case report
Shrimp culture is the most profitable type of aquaculture in Mexico and it is highly developed in the northern states of the Pacific coast. A reduced number of commercial shrimp farms have been established along the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula and have initiated operations with Litopenaeus vannamei. The Federal Government is concerned about the use of exotic species for aquaculture and has prompted research on domestication of Gulf of Mexico native penaeids. This paper reports the first outbreak of necrotizing hepatopancreatitis (NHP) in a farm culturing L. vannamei in Campeche State, Southern Mexico. The implications of this finding with respect to native shrimp species and aquaculture development for the region are discussed.
