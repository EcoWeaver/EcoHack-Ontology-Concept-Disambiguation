Hyptis suaveolens: An emerging invader of Vindhyan plateau, India
This article addresses the change in species composition in Hyptis suaveolens-dominated and H. suaveolens-uninvaded locations in the Vindhyan dry deciduous forest of India. We also assessed the environmental variables that affect the dominance of this species in sites where it has invaded. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that there was a significant change in species composition in those sites dominated by H. suaveolens. The CCA ordination also suggested that H. suaveolens prefers locations with a high pH and rocky areas with a sandy substrate. The results also showed that the number of native species in the community decreases with the increasing dominance of H. suaveolens. This suggests that, for the conservation of biodiversity and the management of areas that are especially dominated by H. suaveolens, the focus needs to be on areas with a high level of rockiness in the Vindhyan plateau, India.
