Response of the round goby, an invasive fish, to food odours
The aquatic environment contains rich dissolved compounds that are often detected by teleost fish through highly developed chemosensory systems (JONES 2002). Olfactory systems are important in controlling functions such as feeding and reproduction that are integral to the survival of an individual. Fish often use biochemical products released by con-specifics or other organisms in locating food, mates, predators, and spawning sites (HARA 1993). When exposed to chemical stimuli from food, fish respond by exhibiting searching behaviours that improve their chances of locating and consuming the food source (HARA 2006). The round goby is a bottom-dwelling fish, introduced into the Laurentian Great Lakes presumably by ballast water of transoceanic vessels (JUDE et al. 1992). They have spread rapidly through all 5 Great Lakes due to their broad diet, extended reproductive season, aggressive interactions with other fishes, and parental care (MACINNIS & CORKUM 2000). Like many fish, the round goby use chemoreception to detect odours in their surrounding environment (CORKUM & BELANGER 2007). In this study, we determine the response of round gobies to food odours from lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis [Mitchill]), dreissenids, and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss [Walbaum]) eggs in lab and field experiments.
