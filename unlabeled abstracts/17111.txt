When and how do species achieve niche stability over long time scales?
Niche conservation is not ubiquitous among all species or all environmental changes. Identifying the underlying basis for variable species responses is important for conservation efforts and macroevolutionary theory and requires comparing multiple clades and types of environmental change. To examine this issue, niche stability was analyzed for a phylogenetically diverse suite of invertebrates that inhabited the epicontinental seas of eastern North America during the Late Ordovician Period (~450 Ma). These taxa experienced fluctuating sea level and a regional biotic invasion event, the Richmondian invasion, during nine time slices spanning approximately three million years. Niche models were generated with Maxent and niche stability was assessed via geographic overlap, niche similarity, and environmental parameters.
