Alien species in the flora of the nature reserve fund of the flatland part of Ukraine
The current study presents a comparative analysis of the non-native floras of 23 protected areas, including 2 biosphere reserves, 5 nature reserves with 9 segregated units, and 12 national parks located in four natural zones of the flatland part of Ukraine. The taxonomic diversity of the studied floras comprises 484 species from 278 genera and 72 families (about 60% of those recorded in the country). The study reveals a considerable variation in taxonomic and typological structures of the alien floras. The spatial distribution of exotic plant species corresponds to the general biological pattern: the majority of the species occur rarely, less species have an average constancy, and only single species are widely dispersed. This pattern, consequently, determines a low similarity among the non-native floras. However, the cluster analysis shows an almost complete zonal differentiation of the studied floras. The exceptions are the floras of the nature reserve areas with a specific functional-territorial structure. The reference value of the natural reserve fund is questioned.
