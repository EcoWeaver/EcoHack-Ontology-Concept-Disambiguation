Effects of nonnative fish and habitat characteristics on lentic herpetofauna in Yosemite National Park, USA
Nonnative fishes have been introduced into naturally fishless mountain lakes worldwide, often with negative consequences for native fauna. In this study, I used data collected during a census of native herpetofauna, nonnative trout, and habitat characteristics at all lentic water bodies in Yosemite National Park (n=2655) to quantify the effect of trout introductions and habitat on the distribution of four amphibian species and two reptile species. Impacts of trout on amphibians and reptiles were characterized using generalized additive models that included as predictor variables fish presence/absence, amphibian presence/absence (only in models for the two reptile species), elevation, water depth, littoral zone and shoreline substrate composition, relative survey date, and location. All species showed significant associations with habitat characteristics, and elevation and water depth appeared particularly important in influencing distributions. In addition, distributions of the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa) and Pacific treefrog (Hyla regilla) were strongly negatively associated with the presence of nonnative trout while those of the Yosemite toad (Bufo canorus) and Sierra newt (Taricha torosa sierrae) were unrelated to trout presence. The distribution of the mountain garter snake (Thamnophis elegans elegans) was strongly negatively associated with the presence of nonnative trout and positively associated with the presence of native amphibians. Regression results for the Sierra garter snake (Thamnophis couchi couchi) were similar except that the direct effect of nonnative trout was considerably weaker. Together, these results indicate that trout introductions have resulted in considerable alteration of Yosemite's herpetofauna. Long-term studies will be necessary to determine whether removal of nonnative trout populations, where possible, would allow these impacts to be partially reversed.
