Towards site-specific management of invasive alien trees based on the assessment of their impacts: the case of Robinia pseudoacacia
Robinia pseudoacacia L. (black locust) is a North American tree, considered controversial because of the conflict between multiple uses by humans and negative environmental impacts, which have resulted in it being listed among the most invasive species in Europe. The current management of Robinia stands in Central Europe varies locally according to national legislation, preferring either socio-economic benefits or biodiversity impacts. We collected field data from our target region of Czechia, reviewed research articles including local grey literature mostly from Central and Southern Europe, unpublished results of local projects and inquired relevant specialists. Because Robinia grows in habitats ranging from urban to forest to natural grassland, neither unrestricted cultivation nor large-scale eradication is applicable as a universal practice. In this paper we suggest a complex management strategy for Robinia stands that takes into account habitat, this species' local ability to spread, as well as economic, cultural and biodiversity aspects. We categorized Robinia stands growing in Europe into eight groups and proposed stratified approach to the management based on decisions that reflect local context. Depending on that, the management includes (i) establishment of new plantations, (ii) maintenance or utilization of existing stands, (iii) tolerance and (iv) conversion to original vegetation. Our complex management strategy will provide a comprehensive guideline for the management of alien trees in Europe.
