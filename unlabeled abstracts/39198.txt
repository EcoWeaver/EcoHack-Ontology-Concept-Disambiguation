The potential for biological control on cryptic plant invasions
Cryptic invasions can be defined as 'the occurrence of an invasive species or genotype that was not previously recognised as alien in origin or not distinguished from other aliens'. Such invasions can result in negative im- pacts on the recipient ecosystems and disturb the evolutionary history of native plant populations. Many cryptic invasions have become so problematic that there is a need to implement control measures. This paper explores the potential for biological control to be implemented as a means of managing cryptic invasions. Firstly, the paper defines the different forms of cryptic invasion, differentiating between interspecific and intraspecific in- vasions; this hierarchy influences how to detect, study and ultimately implement biological control when cryptic invasions occur. Secondly, unique challenges associated with biological control programmes for cryptic inva- sions are addressed, including: the need for intraspecific level host specificity in agents, the occurrence of hy- bridisation between native species/lineages and the target weed, the role of enemy release in cryptic invasions in the presence of closely related native plant species/lineages, and a review of potential stakeholder conflicts of interest and legislation. Biological control of cryptic invasions has been shown to be possible, however the process will be more difficult and complex than controlling traditional targets and will likely take up more time and resources. If these challenges are overcome, then biological control programmes against cryptic invasions should be able to proceed and maintain the same standards as traditional biological control programmes.
