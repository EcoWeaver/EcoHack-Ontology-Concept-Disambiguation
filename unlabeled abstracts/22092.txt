Utilisation of near Infrared Spectroscopy in Pinus Taeda Progeny Tests Located in Southern Brazil
Pinus taeda L. (loblolly pine) is one of the most important commercial timber species in the world. While the species is native to south eastern USA, it has been widely planted in southern Brazil where it is the most commonly planted exotic species. Interest exists in improving the wood quality of Brazilian grown loblolly pine and utilising near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to assess wood properties. The successful application of NIR spectroscopy relies on the development of wood property calibrations with strong statistics which may be difficult when a population is of relatively young age and of limited genetic variation. In this study, the creation of calibrations for air-dry density, microfibril angle (MFA) and stiffness, based on samples from an 11-year-old progeny test located in the Rio Negrinho municipality of Santa Catarina, Brazil was explored. Untreated and math treated (first and second derivative and standard normal variate) NIR spectra that had been collected in 10 mm increments from the radial surface of 80 pith-to-bark wood strips were used to build the calibrations. The strongest calibrations overall were obtained using first derivative spectra and had coefficients of determination ( R2) that ranged from 0.75 (density) to 0.92 (stiffness). Calibrations were tested on a separate test set and performed well with first derivative treated spectra giving the strongest predictions, r2 ranged from 0.73 (density) to 0.90 (stiffness). The strength of the predictions demonstrates that NIR can be utilised to estimate wood properties of loblolly pine progeny tests at a relatively young age.
