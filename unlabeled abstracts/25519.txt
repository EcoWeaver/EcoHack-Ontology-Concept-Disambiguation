Gorging on gobies: beneficial effects of alien prey on a threatened vertebrate
Invasive species often have rapid and far-reaching negative impacts on populations and ecological communities. These effects are most common when invasive species have few competitors or predators. Although higher level carnivores do consume invasive species, quantitative effects of new and abundant food sources on predators have rarely been documented and, as a consequence, potentially positive effects of invasive species may be under appreciated. We investigated the effects of the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814)) on diet composition, growth rate, and body size of the Lake Erie Water Snake (Nerodia sipedon insularum (Conant and Clay, 1937)), which is threatened in the USA and endangered in Ontario, Canada. Water Snakes have shifted their diet, and round gobies now constitute >92% of prey consumed. This shift in diet has occurred in just one or two Water Snake generations, yet has resulted in more rapid growth and attainment of larger body size in Water Snakes. These positive effects may reduce predation, speed reproductive maturity, increase offspring production, and fuel population growth of this threatened species.
