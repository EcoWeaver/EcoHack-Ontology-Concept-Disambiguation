Assessment of Potential Impacts of Exotic Species on Populations of a Threatened Species, White Sands Pupfish, Cyprinodon tularosa
The potential impact of introduced species on rare taxa is of particular concern to conservation biologists. We evaluate the impacts of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) and virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis) on experimental populations of a threatened species, the White Sands pupfish (Cyprinodon tularosa). Forty experimental pupfish populations were exposed to one of four treatments; (a) 1 crayfish, (b) 4 crayfish, (c) 5 adult mosquitofish and (d) control. Pupfish population size and biomass was monitored over the duration of one breeding season. A repeated measure multiple analysis of covariance revealed a significant effect of treatments on response variables (population size and biomass) (P<0.0001). Mosquitofish had a significant effect on population size and biomass (P=0.0330). The effect of one crayfish was not significant (P=0. 0683). However, 4 crayfish had a significant effect (P<0.0001) on population size. We use these data, along with information on environmental tolerances of crayfish and mosquitofish, to evaluate risks for specific pupfish populations.
