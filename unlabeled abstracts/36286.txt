First study of food webs in a large glacial river: the trophic role of invasive trout
Abstract The aim of this study was to determine the food webs structure of a large Patagonian river in two river sections (Upstream and Midstream) and to evaluate isotopic overlap between native and introduced species. We used stable isotope analyses of d15N and d13C and stomach content. The Upstream section had a more complex food webs structure with a greater richness of macroinvertebrates and fish species than Midstream. Upstream basal resources were dominated by filamentous algae. Lake Trout were found to have a higher trophic position than all other fish species in that area although, the most abundant fish species, were Rainbow Trout. Depending on the life stage, Rainbow Trout shifted from prey to competitor/predator. In the Midstream section, the base of the food webs was dominated by coarse particulate organic matter, and adult Rainbow Trout had the highest trophic level. Isotopic values changed among macroinvertebrates and fish for both areas. The two most abundant native and invasive species -- Puyen and Rainbow Trout -- showed an isotopic separation in Midstream but did not in Upstream areas. The presence of invasive fish that occupy top trophic levels can have a significant impact on native fish populations that have great ecological importance in the region.
