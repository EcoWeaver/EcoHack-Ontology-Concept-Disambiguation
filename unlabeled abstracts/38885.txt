First non-native establishment of the carnivorous assassin snail, Anentome helena (von dem Busch in Philippi, 1847)
Anentome helena (von dem Busch in Philippi, 1847) is known among aquarium enthusiasts as the "assassin snail", and is usually kept to prey on other snail species that are considered pests in home aquaria. There have been concerns that, given its prevalence in the ornamental pet trade, it is only a matter of time before this predator is introduced to the wild. We report the first occurrence of established populations of Anentome helena in a non-native habitat, and provide CO1 sequences of the species from the wild.
