Essential oil yield and composition of native species of the Myrtaceae family from "Campos Gerais" of the Atlantic Forest in Parana State
The Myrtaceae family has great occurrence in Brazil, mainly in the Atlantic Forest of the South and Southeast regions and presents potential for essential oil production. This work aimed to evaluate the essential oil yield and composition of the species Myrciaria delicatula, Campomanesia xantocarpha, Campomanesia aurea, Calyptranthes clusiifolia, Myrcia splendens, Eugenia osoriana, Myrciaria tenella, Myrceugenia reitzii, Calyptranthes concinna e Myrcia arborensis from a segment of the Atlantic Forest of Parana State. The sample collections for essential oil extraction, photographic records and herbarium specimens preparation for botanical species identification were made at the Private Reserve of Natural Heritage (PRNP) Butuguara in Palmeira (PR), with "Campos Gerais" formations. The identification and the official deposit of the species were made at the HFIE Herbarium. The essential oil extraction was carried out by hydrodistillation of fresh and dried leaves using a Clevenger type apparatus and the chemical composition was analyzed by gas phase chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Myrceugenia reitzii showed essential oil yield superior to other species and the essential oil yield of all species increased after drying. The chemical composition in the samples showed mono and sesquiterpenes, being the sesquiterpenes in higher percentages. The drying conditions affected the essential oil composition of for the majority of the evaluated species.
