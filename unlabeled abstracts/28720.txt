A native bird as a predator for the invasive apple snail, a novel rice field invader in Europe
1. Since 2009, the apple snail Pomacea maculata has become a new invader in rice fields and wetlands in Europe, thus far invading only the Ebro Delta (northeastern Spain). It is considered a highly invasive and damaging species, resulting in large economic losses worldwide. 2. Despite the great negative impact of the invasive apple snail in the agriculture and natural wetlands, it has become an abundant potential resource for avian native predators. 3. In this study, stable isotopic analysis was used to assess the consumption of the apple snail by the glossy ibis Plegadis falcinellus in the Ebro Delta. 4. The results indicate the importance of the apple snail in the diet of this native bird. In particular, isotopic results indicated that apple snails and freshwater coleopterans were the main prey in the diet of glossy ibis chicks, accounting for 26-40% of their diet. Thus, this native bird species could potentially help in the biological control of this invasive snail, but it is not expected to eradicate it. 5. While the spread of this pest in rice fields and wetlands is not desirable, we predict that the apple snail will follow a path similar to other invasive species, such as the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii, in establishing itself as part of the wetlands food web.
