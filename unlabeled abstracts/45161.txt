Perceptions of the impacts of invasive alien plants in the riparian zone of the Ganga River: Insights from Varanasi, India
Riparian zones are among the most threatened habitats due to invasive species. Traditionally, studies on invasive alien plants (IAPs) of riparian zones have focused on their ecological implications. Studies assessing the impacts of IAPs on ecosystem services (ES) and ecosystem disservices (EDS) through people's perceptions are lacking in this habitat. This study was conducted in the riparian zone of the Ganga River in Varanasi, India. We used a questionnaire-based survey to assess people's perceptions of IAPs and their potential to provide ES and EDS. Results indicated that residents were aware of IAPs and perceived these both positively (providing ES) and negatively (providing EDS). Soil stabilization and loss of native plant diversity were the most commonly perceived ES and EDS respectively. Socio-demographic variables such as age and education shape people's perceptions of IAPs. Younger and educated respondents were more likely to perceive IAPs negatively. Respondents most commonly used fire as a practice to manage IAPs. They placed Parthenium hysterophorus L. as the highest priority based on its impacts and management needs. This study highlights the need to incorporate public perceptions into the policy, planning, and management of IAPs, particularly in the riparian zone.
