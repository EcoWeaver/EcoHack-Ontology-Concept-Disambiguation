Growth, biomass allocation, morphology, and photosynthesis of invasive Eupatorium adenophorum and its native congeners grown at four irradiances
Eupatorium adenophorum is one of the more noxious invasive plants worldwide. However, the mechanisms underlying its invasiveness are still not well elucidated. In this study, we compared the invader with its two native congeners (E. heterophyllum and E. japonicum) at four irradiances in terms of growth, biomass allocation, morphology, and photosynthesis. The higher light-saturated photosynthetic rate (P max) and total leaf area of the invader may contribute to its higher relative growth rate (RGR) and total biomass compared with its native congeners. Total biomass and RGR increased significantly with the increase of P max and total leaf area. The higher support organ mass fraction and the lower root mass fraction of the invader may also contribute to its higher RGR and biomass through increasing carbon assimilation and reducing respiratory carbon loss, respectively. The higher growth rate of the invader increased its total leaf area, ramet number, and crown area. These traits may help the invader to form dense monoculture, outshading native plant species. However, consistently higher leaf area ratio, specific leaf area, and leaf mass fraction were not found across irradiances for the invader compared with its native congeners. Higher plasticity in response to irradiance was also not found for the invader. The invader retained advantages over the natives across irradiances, while its performance decreased with lower irradiance. The results indicate that the invader may be one of the few super invaders. Reducing irradiance may inhibit its invasions.
