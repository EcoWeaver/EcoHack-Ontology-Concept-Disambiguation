Notes on the marine algae of the Bermudas. 8. Further additions to the flora, including Griffithsia aestivana sp. nov. (Ceramiaceae, Rhodophyta) and an update on the alien Cystoseira compressa (Sargassaceae, Heterokontophyta)
Griffithsia aestivana sp. nov. is described as an endemic from Bermuda. Vegetatively, it is most similar to G. capi- tata from the eastern Atlantic Ocean, but the two differ in overall size and in the tetrasporic state. Eleven other marine algal taxa are reported from Bermuda for the first time: Anadyomene howei, Struvea elegans, Cladopho- ropsis macromeres, Derbesia turbinata, Caulerpa race- mosa var. lamourouxii, Halimeda discoidea, Chrysymenia nodulosa, Gloiocladia iyoensis, Dasya caraibica, Chon- drophycus iridescens and Polysiphonia scopulorum. All except D. turbinata represent new northern limits of dis- tribution in the North Atlantic Ocean. In addition, recent Bermuda collections of the alien Mediterranean Cysto- seira compressa and the rarely found Womersleyella setacea are detailed.
