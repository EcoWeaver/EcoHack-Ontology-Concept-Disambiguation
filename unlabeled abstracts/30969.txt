European native Myriophyllum spicatum showed a higher $${\text{HCO}}_{3}^{ - }$$ HCO 3 - use capacity than alien invasive Myriophyllum heterophyllum
Light, temperature and the availability of carbon are three major drivers of submerged plant growth, photosynthesis and competitive strength. A laboratory experiment using a three factorial experimental design (light x temperature x CO2) was used to evaluate growth responses (RGR (relative growth rate), LDMC (leaf dry matter content) and root:shoot ratio) and physiological changes (pigment characteristics and net photosynthesis under CO2 depletion) in the European native Myriophyllum spicatum and the non-native invasive M. heterophyllum to changes in the three variables. Both species showed temperature optima of 21degC and highest growth rates under high light and high CO2 conditions. Additionally, the capacity of both to use HCO3- was significantly higher in plants acclimated to CO2 depletion than for plants growing in CO2 rich water. Summarizing, both species showed their ability to growth under variable conditions, but M. spicatum is the better HCO3- user and showed better acclimation in growth and physiological parameters to CO2 depletion. Overall, native M. spicatum reached higher growth rates and showed a better acclimation to low CO2 conditions than the non-native M. heterophyllum. Thus the HCO3- -use capacity alone cannot explain the success of evergreen M. heterophyllum in formerly M. spicatum dominated waters.
