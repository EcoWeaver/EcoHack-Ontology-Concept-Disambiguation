Go forth, evolve and prosper: the genetic basis of adaptive evolution in an invasive species
Invasive species stand accused of a familiar litany of offences, including displacing native species, disrupting ecological processes and causing billions of dollars in ecological damage (Cox ). Despite these transgressions, invasive species have at least one redeeming virtue - they offer us an unparalleled opportunity to investigate colonization and responses of populations to novel conditions in the invaded habitat (Elton ; Sakai et al. ). Invasive species are by definition colonists that have arrived and thrived in a new location. How they are able to thrive is of great interest, especially considering a paradox of invasion (Sax & Brown ): if many populations are locally adapted (Leimu & Fischer ), how could species introduced into new locations become so successful? One possibility is that populations adjust to the new conditions through plasticity - increasing production of allelopathic compounds (novel weapons), or taking advantage of new prey, for example. Alternatively, evolution could play a role, with the populations adapting to the novel conditions of the new habitat. There is increasing evidence, based on phenotypic data, for rapid adaptive evolution in invasive species (Franks et al. ; Colautti & Barrett ; Sultan et al. ). Prior studies have also demonstrated genetic changes in introduced populations using neutral markers, which generally do not provide information on adaptation. Thus, the genetic basis of adaptive evolution in invasive species has largely remained unknown. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Vandepitte et al. () provide some of the first evidence in invasive populations for molecular genetic changes directly linked to adaptation.
