Spiders as indicators of microhabitat changes after a grass invasion in salt-marshes: synthetic results from a case study in the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay
Salt marshes are simple ecosystems characterized by extreme conditions; two abiotic factors appear to structure habitats: regular submergence and the resulting soil salinity. These ecosystems support highly specialized species that have a high conservation value. In the last ten years, invasion by Elymus athericus (Poaceae) has led to a major change in vegetation cover (including changes in micro-habitats architecture) in salt marshes of the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay (France). In this study, we tried to determine whether ecological structure and high conservation value of invaded salt marshes had been preserved using spiders as indicators. The functional groups, abundances and flood resistance abilities of spider communities were compared between initial and invaded stations during 2002 and 2003. Invasion by E. athericus had both positive and negative consequences for spider communities, in particular for the dominant halophilic species. Pardosa purbeckensis populations clearly declined in habitats invaded by E. athericus, whereas Arctosa fulvolineata seemed to benefit greatly from the invasion. Functional groups were strongly affected by the plant invasion. Relation between the habitat change (vegetal invasion) and changes in the spider communities (both in terms of functional groups and halophilic species) confirms the high value of this taxon as bioindicators. Lastly, we suggest using abundances of P. purbeckensis as a parameter likely to help monitoring further salt marsh evolutions (such as management).
