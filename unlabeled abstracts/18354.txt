Suppression of invasive topmouth gudgeonPseudorasbora parvaby native pikeEsox luciusin ponds
1. Asian topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva has been recognized as a highly invasive cyprinid fish species in Europe that may present risk to native fish communities. 2. The present study aimed to investigate whether a native piscivorous fish, pike Esox lucius, is able to reduce the establishment success and invasiveness of topmouth gudgeon in shallow ponds. A large-scale, replicated whole-pond experiment was performed in which ponds were spontaneously colonized by topmouth gudgeon and exposed to experimental native fish communities with and without pike. 3. The results of the present study provide evidence for strong negative effects of pike stocking on the abundance and biomass of topmouth gudgeon, while no effects on native fish species were found. The present study suggests that the presence of native pike can considerably enhance the biotic resistance of fish communities against invasion by topmouth gudgeon. 4. It is argued that the resistance of fish communities against invasion by exotic species may in some cases be enhanced by management strategies that reinforce the presence and abundance of pike.
