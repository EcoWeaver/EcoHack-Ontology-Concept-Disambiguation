Combined use of a synthetic trail pheromone and insecticidal bait provides effective control of an invasive ant.
Except for sex pheromones, use of pheromones in pest management has been largely unexplored. A high concentration of trail pheromone disrupts ant trail following and foraging, and thus synthetic trail pheromone can be a novel control agent for pest ants. In this study, a year-long treatment of small areas (100 m(2) plots of urban house gardens) with synthetic trail pheromone, insecticidal bait or both was conducted to develop a novel control method of the invasive Argentine ant Linepithema humile (Mayr). The ant population could be maintained lower than or similar to the initial level only by combined treatment with synthetic trail pheromone and insecticidal bait. Actually, the ant population was nearly always lowest in combination treatment plots. Throughout the study period, the ant population in plots treated with either one of synthetic trail pheromone or insecticidal bait remained similar to no-treatment plots. Combination treatment may be a more effective and environmentally friendly method for controlling invasive ants than conventional methods. Extermination of ants by insecticidal bait and inhibition of re-infestation by pheromone may be the mechanism of the combination effect. This is the first study to show a significant effect of synthetic trail pheromone on ant population.
