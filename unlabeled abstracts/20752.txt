The role of biological control in wildlands
Use of classical biological control to suppress invasive plants or insects is often an important component of programs for the conservation and restoration of wildlands. Its use contributes to preservation of native biodiversity, maintenance of ecosystem services from wildlands, and protection of sources of natural resources for human societies. Use of classical biological control in wildlands is a form of planned, beneficial invasion and its effective use requires careful integration of conservation biologists and biological control scientists to define ecological goals for projects and to investigate and judge the potential safety of biological control agents proposed for release. Greater cooperation between these groups is essential for expanded and safe use of this process.
