The relationship between native species richness and exotic species richness or occurrence will always be negative when the total number of species is accounted for in statistical models: A response to Beaury et al
Beaury et al. (2020) attempt to address the scale dependence of evidence for biotic resistance by including environmental covariates that can account for total species richness. However, this approach will incorrectly estimate relationships, driven by the accuracy of the covariates rather than the true relationship between native and exotic species. Analysis of simulated data show that inclusion of a covariate that correlates with total species richness (red lines) will lead to a significant negative relationship (black lines) between native species richness and non-native species richness (a and b) or non-native species occurrence (c and d) even though the variables are uncorrelated with each other. The strength of this relationship is highly correlated with the accuracy of the covariate for identifying total species richness, with stronger relationships predicted when the covariate is more accurate.
