Swimming and jumping ability of 10 Great Plains fish species
Stream fragmentation can be detrimental to lotic fish species by preventing important life history movements. The maximum swimming speed and jumping ability of 10 stream fish species were evaluated to describe potential water velocity and height barriers to fish movement. A 10-L swim tunnel was used to test maximum swimming performance and an artificial waterfall with an adjustable weir was used to test jumping performance. All tested fish were between 30 and 100 mm total length. Mean maximum swimming velocity ranged from 37.5 +- 1.2 cm/s for mosquitofish to 65.0 +- 1.7 cm/s for largemouth bass and jumping ability ranged from 0 cm for bluegill to 13 cm for green sunfish. Differences in swimming and jumping ability demonstrate how limits to dispersal can be taxa specific and therefore, impact the conservation of rare species and management of exotic species. The values determined in this study can be useful in creating models to predict barriers to fish passage.
