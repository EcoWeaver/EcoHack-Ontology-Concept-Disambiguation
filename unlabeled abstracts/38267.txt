Presence of the introduced ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi A. Agassiz, 1865 in a lagoon system within the River Rhone delta (southeast France)
The introduced ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi A. Agassiz, 1865 was observed in the Vaccares Lagoon (River Rhone delta, southeast France) for the first time in 2016. Large blooms had been observed during the summer in 2016, with monthly zooplankton community monitoring carried out from November 2016 to October 2017. This was done to better understand the dynamics of this ctenophore within this brackish Lagoon. In parallel, we report the first record of Mnemiopsis leidyi in another Mediterranean lagoon near Camargue delta (Estomac Lagoon) in 2019.
