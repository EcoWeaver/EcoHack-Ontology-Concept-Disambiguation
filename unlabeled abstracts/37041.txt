Miracula moenusica, a new member of the holocarpic parasitoid genus from the invasive freshwater diatom Pleurosira laevis
Holocarpic oomycetes are poorly known but widespread parasites in freshwater and marine ecosystems. Most of the holocarpic species seem to belong to clades that diverge before the two crown lineages of the oomycetes, the Saprolegniomycetes and the Peronosporomycetes. Recently, the genus Miracula was described to accommodate Miracula helgolandica, a holocarpic parasitoid of Pseudo-nitzschia diatoms, which received varying support for its placement as the earliest-diverging oomycete lineage. In the same phylogenetic reconstruction, Miracula helgolandica was grouped with some somewhat divergent sequences derived from environmental sequencing, indicating that Miracula would not remain monotypic. Here, a second species of Miracula is reported, which was found as a parasitoid in the limnic centric diatom Pleurosira leavis. Its life-cycle stages are described and depicted in this study and its phylogenetic placement in the genus Miracula revealed. As a consequence, the newly discovered species is introduced as Miracula moenusica.
