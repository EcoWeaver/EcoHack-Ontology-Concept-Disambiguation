First report of Exorista xanthaspis (Wiedemann, 1830) (Diptera: Tachinidae), a larval-pupal parasitoid on invasive pest, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) in maize from India
For the first time, the tachinid fly, Exorista xanthaspis (Wiedemann, 1830) (Diptera: Tachinidae), was found to parasitize the larvae of fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) collected from maize fields in Karnataka, India. The field survey conducted during 2018-19 revealed the occurrence of E. xanthaspis on the larvae of S. frugiperda with the parasitism rate of 1.85 to 4.55% in maize fields. The identity of tachinid parasitoid was confirmed by amplifying Cytochrome Oxidase I gene (CO1-658 bp) and DNA
