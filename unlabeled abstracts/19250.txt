Endozoochorous dispersal of alien and native plants by two palearctic avian frugivores with special emphasis on invasive giant goldenrod Solidago gigantea
Abstract The role of frugivorous birds in dispersal of the seeds of fleshy-fruited plants is well understood, but other groups of birds like granivores and omnivores can also act as vectors, especially in the process of non-standard dispersal. In this study we examined the role of two widely distributed birds (the Eurasian Blackbird, Turdus merula, and the Black Redstart, Phoenicurus ochruros) in seed dispersal. We analyzed the content of 279 droppings of the Black Redstart collected between July and October and 85 droppings of the Eurasian Blackbird collected during January. In total we found 366 seeds, representing 11 plant taxa, in the faecal samples; 93% of the seeds belonged to fleshy-fruited species. The most numerous were two native taxa, Sambucus racemosa/nigra, in summer and autumn, Crataegus monogyna in winter, and one alien species Morus alba, which is dispersed in summer. We also found seeds of four dry-fruited species; the most interesting of which was the presence of anemochorous seeds of Solidago gigantea (a highly invasive alien species). The seeds were found only in droppings of the Eurasian Blackbird. Considering the obtained results the need for further studies on bird-plant interactions should be a priority.
