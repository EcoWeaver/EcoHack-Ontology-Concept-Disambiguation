Characterization of a newly discovered Beauveria bassiana isolate to Franklimiella occidentalis Perganda, a non-native invasive species in China
In this study, a new virulent Beauveria bassiana isolate (B. bassiana-CYT5) had been identified as a new member of the species B. bassiana. The B. bassiana-CYT5 isolate was compared with four other virulent B. bassiana isolates and found to be highly infectious and virulent against the Franklimiella occidentalis Perganda. The B. bassiana-CYT5 could approximately 93.08% mortality of F. occidentalis 6 days post inoculation in the concentration of 1x10(8) conidia/mL. The phylogenetic tree based on ITS and partial sequence of elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-alpha) indicated that B. bassiana-CYT5 isolate was in a cluster of B. bassiana. Furthermore, B. bassiana-CYT5 isolate demonstrated high heat tolerance (60-100% relative germination) between 1-h and 2-h exposure at 37 degC, 38 degC, 39 degC and 40 degC, respectively. So our results suggested that B. bassiana-CYT5 isolate could be a new efficient biocontrol agent against F. occidentalis.
