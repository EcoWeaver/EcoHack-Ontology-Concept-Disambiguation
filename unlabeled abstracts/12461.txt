A molecular approach to understand the riddle of the invasive success of the tarantula, Brachypelma vagans, on Cozumel Island, Mexico
Invasive populations typically demonstrate genetic isolation which results in a loss of genetic diversity and a reduction in invasion success. This study focused on the genetic population of a successful invasive species of tarantula. Individuals were sampled in two mainland localities of the Yucatan Peninsula (Zoh-Laguna and Raudales), in addition to two island localities (El Cedral and Rancho Guadalupe on Cozumel Island). All populations present high genetic diversity (mean: He = 0.23, P = 99%), with significant differences between the Raudales and Rancho Guadalupe localities. The AMOVA analysis revealed a significant population structure (14.5% variation among populations), consistent with the gene differentiation coefficient (GST = 0.21), and spatial analysis of population structure. Our results suggested that the original introduced population did not suffer a loss of genetic diversity during establishment on the island, possibly a result of different biological conditions. Population structure analysis leads us to suggest that one island population is similar to the original genetic profile, whereas the genotypic profile of the other island population reflects recent introductions from the mainland. We identified a potential risk of extinction for one local mainland population, suggesting that this species may be a successful invader in a new environment but endangered in some parts of its natural area.
