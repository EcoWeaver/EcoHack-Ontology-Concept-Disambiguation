7. Examining the Impacts of Zebra Mussels as an Invasive Species in the Great Lakes Region and the Role of Stakeholders in Effective Mitigation Strategies
Zebra mussels were first introduced into the Great Lakes region in 1988, via the ballast water of international ships traveling through the St. Lawrence River. Since then, the aggressive colonization of zebra mussels have had devastating effects on the native aquatic biodiversity in the Great Lakes region. The continued proliferation of zebra mussels have led to increased filtering, high light transmittance through water and growth of benthic (lowest level of a body of water) plants. Due to the intensive filtration of zebra mussels, rapid bioaccumulation of botulinum toxin in their systems have caused high levels of mortality for waterfowl predators. As zebra mussels continue to dominate in predator-prey interactions and interspecies competition, a shift in the ecosystem equilibrium is occurring on varying trophic levels. These changes have not gone unnoticed. Zebra mussels have cost Canadian industries, businesses and communities over $5 billion in a single decade in clogged pipes and turbine damages. The associated economic repercussions from infrastructural damages and native species declines necessitate engagement from a multitude of stakeholders. Public awareness is absolutely vital in minimizing the impact of zebra mussels and preventing their distribution across freshwater in North America. In this presentation, I will discuss the ecological, economic and societal impacts of zebra mussels since their introduction to the Great Lakes region. In addition, I will examine a multitude of management strategies and recommendations to government, private sector and public stakeholders to reduce future impacts of mussels in the Great Lakes region.
