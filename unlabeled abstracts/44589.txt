First report of the Japanese red alga Antithamnion nipponicum (Ceramiales, Rhodophyta) in Norway, an invasive species new to northern Europe

From its native range in Japan and Korea the alga was first introduced to the Mediterranean Sea in 1988. Except for a possible report from the Azores (as A. pectinatum) there are no published records from European Atlantic coasts.

Vegetative and tetrasporangium-bearing plants were found, and the specimens conform to the detailed description recently published by Cho et
