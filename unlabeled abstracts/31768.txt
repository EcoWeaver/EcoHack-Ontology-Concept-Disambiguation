Testing the Enemy Release Hypothesis on tall-statured grasses in South Africa, using Arundo donax, Phragmites australis, and Phragmites mauritianus as models
AbstractThe Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) predicts that introduced plant species can escape herbivory and therefore have a competitive advantage over native plants, which are exposed to both generalist and specialist natural enemies. In this study, the ERH was explored using the invasive alien species, Arundo donax and two native tall-statured grasses, the cosmopolitan Phragmites australis and African endemic Phragmites mauritianus in South Africa. It was predicted that A. donax would have reduced species richness of herbivores compared with the native Phragmites spp., that it would be devoid of specialist herbivores and would thus be experiencing enemy escape in the adventive range. The herbivore assemblages were determined from both field surveys and a literature review. The assumptions of the ERH were for the most part not met; 13 herbivores were found on A. donax compared with 17 on P. australis and 20 on P. mauritianus. Arundo donax had two specialist herbivores from its native range, and shared native herbivores with Phragmites spp. Although A. donax had reduced species richness and diversity compared with that found in the native distribution, it has partially re-acquired a herbivore assemblage which is similar to that found on analogous native species. This suggests that enemy release may not fully explain the invasive success of A. donax in South Africa.
