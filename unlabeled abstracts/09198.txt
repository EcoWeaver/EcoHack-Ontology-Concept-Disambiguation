Nativism and Nature: Rethinking Biological Invasion
The study of biological invasions raises troubling scientific, political and moral issues that merit discussion and debate on a broad scale.

Rethinking conservationists' conceptions of biological invasion is essential to the development of a progressive environmental science, politics, and philosophy.
