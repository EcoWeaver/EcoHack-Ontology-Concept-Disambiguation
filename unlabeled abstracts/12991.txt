Occurrence of Ornamental Fishes:A Looming Danger for Inland Fish Diversity of India
India is known for its immense aquatic wealth, in particular freshwater fish resource. But, the ongoing ornamental fish trade and introduction of exotic fishes in the wild pose a serious threat to India's native aquatic diversity. Recent studies from several parts of India have revealed the presenceof several ornamental fishes in inland water bodies, including the biologically sensitive areas such as Chalakudy River in the Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot which harbours 16 endangered and 4 critically endangered species. So far, 27 ornamental species have been reported in the inland wetlands of India. Among them, 15 have already established a good breeding population and have emerged as a threat to the native species. Awareness among the public, policy makers and researchers about the impacts ofornamental fishes in inland water is the need of the hour. Stringent measures should be taken to monitor the aquarium fish trade and accide ntal release of exotic species into inland waters. If not, the invasion of ornamental fishes may demolish the inland aquatic diversity of native Indian breeds
