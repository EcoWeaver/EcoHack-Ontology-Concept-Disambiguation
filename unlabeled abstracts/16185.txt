Vegetation change and eco-evolutionary dynamics
QuestionEco-evolutionary dynamics is a concept encapsulating a feedback between ecology and evolution, acting on short ecological time-scales. Recent studies suggest that such dynamics have been generally over-looked. The objective of this paper is to examine how eco-evolutionary dynamics may contribute to vegetation science. LocationGlobal. Methods In this paper I discuss eco-evolutionary dynamics in the context of vegetation science, with a focus on effects derived from human-mediated niche construction, manifested as new habitats, non-native species, and changing connectivity and spatial configuration of habitats. Results and ConclusionsI suggest that eco-evolutionary dynamics have the potential to influence plant community composition and assembly, and thus that eco-evolutionary dynamics should become focus of studies in vegetation science.
