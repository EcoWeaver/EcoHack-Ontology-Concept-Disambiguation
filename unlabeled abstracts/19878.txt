Marine alien Mollusca in Italy: a critical review and state of the knowledge
The state of the knowledge about the marine alien molluscan species from Italy is provided based on a critical review of records compiled from an extensive literature survey and from unpublished data obtained from 2005 to 2010. Based on the IUCN definition of 'alien', 35 molluscan taxa (18 Gastropoda, 16 Bivalvia and 1 Cephalopoda) are reported here, for each of which the following data (collected up to December 2010) are provided: published and unpublished records from the coastal and offshore territorial seawaters of Italy, including lagoons, within the 14 biogeographical sea divisions covering the Italian shores, date of first record, most plausible vector(s) of introduction and establishment status. The southern Ionian Sea, the northern Adriatic Sea and the eastern-central Tyrrhenian Sea resulted to be the areas most affected by alien molluscan introductions. The rate of records of new alien species (evaluated on the basis of live findings) is quite uniform over five decades, with six to eight species recorded per decade. The analysis of the vectors showed shipping/maritime transport to be the most common vector of introduction (40%), followed by trade (24%). Nineteen alien molluscan species (54%) were considered as established in Italy.
