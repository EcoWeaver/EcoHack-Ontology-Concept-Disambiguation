Vegetation of riprapped revetments along the freshwater tidal Hudson River, New York
Riprapped revetments are a common shore defense along lakes, rivers, estuaries, and the ocean, but little is known about the ecology of these structures. We studied the amount and composition of vascular vegetation on riprapped revetments along the freshwater tidal Hudson River, New York. Cover, species richness, and species composition of vegetation varied greatly across the 21 study sites, from nearly barren sites to densely vegetated sites. The flora was split about equally between native and nonnative species, and vines were especially well represented. Vegetation cover and composition were correlated with the age, slope, particle size, and roughness of revetments, as well as site exposure and local management practices. We suggest that the ecological functions provided by revetment vegetation vary enormously from site to site along the Hudson, and could be enhanced by deliberate design and management.
