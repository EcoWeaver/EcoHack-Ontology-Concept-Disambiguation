Intensified agriculture favors evolved resistance to biological control
Significance The need for agricultural production to meet the food demands of a growing human population will require sustainable and acceptable pest management, such as biological control, across 11% (1.5 billion ha) of the globe's land surface. However, the long-term viability of this ecosystem service can be threatened by the expansion and simplification of agricultural systems, which may facilitate the evolution of resistance by pests to their control agents. This study uses a national dataset to present evidence for the acquisition of resistance by a ryegrass weevil pest to its parasitoid wasp over the last 21 y. This resistance was not associated with differences in environmental conditions but rather is specific to the most commonly grown pasture grass species.
