Native and exotic coniferous species in Europe possible host plants for the potentially invasive Siberian moth,Dendrolimus sibiricus1Tschtv. (Lepidoptera, Lasiocampidae)
The performance of young larvae of the potentially invasive Siberian moth Dendrolimus sibiricus Tschtv. has been studied for the first time on the native and exotic coniferous species which are widely distributed and of considerable commercial value in Europe. Picea, Abies, the introduced Pinus species (five-needle pine only), and species from the exotic genera Pseudotsuga and Cedrus (all Pinaceae) are found to be suitable hosts for pest development. Two-needle pines and species from non-native Tsuga (also Pinaceae) are poor hosts in terms of larval performance though they may support growth of neonates (most sensitive to food quality). Coniferous species from other families: Taxaceae and Cupressaceae are inedible for the pest. The fact that the Siberian moth is able to survive and develop on all the tested genera of Pinaceae and that some of them constitute two thirds of the European forests underline how harmful this defoliator could be in the case of its introduction into European countries.
