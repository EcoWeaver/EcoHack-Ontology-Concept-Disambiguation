The kudzu connection: Exploring the link between land use and invasive species
From kudzu to zebra mussels, invasive species have wreaked environmental and economic havoc by modifying ecosystems, damaging crops, threatening native species, and serving as hosts to pests and viruses. Invasive species are a clearly a problem--but are they a land use problem? This study establishes a potential nexus between land use planning and biological invasions, or bioinvasions. The study also identifies the types of regulatory and non-regulatory tools used by local governments to address invasive species, including bans and ordinances, planning and policies, permit requirements, partnerships and projects, education, and other strategies.
