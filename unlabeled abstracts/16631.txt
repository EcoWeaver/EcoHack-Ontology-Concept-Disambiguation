A conceptual model of community dynamics during the transport stage of the invasion process: a case study of ships' ballast
After J. L. Lockwood, P. Cassey and T. Blackburn (2009, Diversity and Distributions, 15, 904-910) first described a theoretical relationship between propagule pressure and colonization pressure, two empirical studies demonstrated that the transport stage of the invasion process can profoundly influence the strength of the relationship among multiple events, as well as predictions of introduction risk. However, studies exploring dynamics of transported communities are rare, as repeated-measures sampling during transportation by any vector is logistically difficult. We constructed a conceptual model of community dynamics during transportation and supported it by empirical data for propagule pressure and colonization pressure of plankton.
