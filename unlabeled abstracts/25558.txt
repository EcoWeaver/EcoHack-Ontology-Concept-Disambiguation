Invasibility of an inland area in NE Spain by alien plants
This study examines the alien flora of a representative zone of the continental northeast region of the Iberian Peninsula, in the Huesca province. Its aims were to determine the biological and ecological factors responsible for the invasive behaviour of the alien species, along with factors related to the environment and land use that could increase the vulnerability of the different habitats towards invasion. Results were then compared with previous observations made in the coastal areas closest to this inland region. Relationships between the invasive nature and the biological and ecological characteristics of the species were evaluated by logistic analysis. General linear model analysis was used to correlate environmental factors with the capacity of the region's habitats to accept these invaders. Perhaps the most noticeable feature was the high number of alien plants growing as crop weeds in the continental study area. The factors found to be most related to the invasive behaviour of the alien species were biological type, route of introduction and the disturbance degree of the habitat. Human population density, average yearly rainfall and temperature, and to a lesser extent, land use were the environmental factors most significantly associated with the number of alien species present. Our findings indicate that the invasibility of continental areas of the NE Iberian Peninsula by alien plants is notably lower compared to the closest coastal zones, the degree of naturalisation of alien species within the native flora also being lower. Differences between the coast and interior in terms of the origins and introduction routes of the alien plants were also evident. Environments showing the greatest capacity to accommodate alien plant species were coastal areas, where the land is mostly given over to urban use and there is a predominance of fluvial and riparian ecosystems.
