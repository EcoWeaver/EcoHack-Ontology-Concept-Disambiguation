Record of nile tilapia in the Mandira River, Cananeia, Sao Paulo State
The present short communication reports the occurrence of Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in the Mandira River, in the extractive reserve in the Cananeia estuary, Sao Paulo State. In May 2014, using dip nets, we collected five specimens of O. niloticus in the estuary, with length ranging from 1.4 to 2.5 cm and weight between 0.8 and 2.3 g. Samplings performed in July indicated the presence of additional four specimens of O. niloticus in other stretches of the same river. The occurrence of alien species in conservation areas has high ecological importance, as they can cause environmental and biodiversity alterations; in Brazil, the introduction of alien species is usually related to economic activities, such as the Nile tilapia aquaculture.
