A new invasive species in South America: Pinus oocarpa Schiede ex Schltdl
Conifers have a long history of introductions into many parts of the world and are among the most notorious plant invaders. At least 20 species of the genus Pinus are now considered to be invasive in at least one region of the southern hemisphere. Here, we present a quantitative report of invasion by Pinus oocarpa in a relatively undisturbed vegetation of the Cerrado region of Brazil. The invasion front of P. oocarpa was 458 m distant from the area of introduction, which represents a mean rate of spread of 12.72 m year -1 . The average density of invasive plants was 561 ind ha -1 , with a maximum density of 1,212 ind ha -1 . It is currently unknown if the studied invasive population has produced negative impacts on the invaded ecosystem. However, it would be safe to assume that with the observed densities and rate of spread, P. oocarpa could affect the native community that it invaded. An early response targeting the eradication of the invasive population could prevent these ecological costs.
