Seasonal decline in plant defence is associated with relaxed offensive oviposition behaviour in the viburnum leaf beetlePyrrhalta viburni
1. Plant defence of Viburnum shrubs against oviposition by its specialist herbivore, the viburnum leaf beetle [VLB Pyrrhalta viburni(Paykull)], involves an egg-crushing wound response in twigs. Although the response is variable among Viburnum species, it can have a strong impact on egg survivorship. Beetles typically aggregate egg masses with conspecifics along infested twigs, forming clusters that can overwhelm the twig response. It was investigated whether twig responses and beetle oviposition behaviour vary seasonally.2. In a field experiment, twig defences decreased towards the end of the VLB oviposition period: wound response of the North American Viburnum dentatum L. and the European V. opulus L. was reduced by 100% and 54%, respectively, in September compared with the July to August period.3. Oviposition trials demonstrated a corresponding behavioural change: VLB females displayed aggregative oviposition in August, but not in September.4. Further tests revealed that late-season VLB females reverted to aggregative oviposition after being kept on uninfested twigs, whereas females kept on heavily infested twigs did not. This behavioural change suggests that relaxation of aggregative oviposition originates from cues associated with high densities of egg masses.5. Relaxation of aggregative oviposition may be adaptive (and beneficial for invasion) on shrubs with low levels of defences by reducing intra-specific competition.
