Nutrient availability and invasive fish jointly drive community dynamics in an experimental aquatic system
Species invasions increasingly occur alongside other forms of ecosystem change, highlighting the need to understand how invasion outcomes are influenced by environmental factors. Within freshwaters, two of the most widespread drivers of change are introduced fishes and nutrient loading, yet it remains difficult to predict how interactions between these drivers affect invasion success and consequences for native communities. To test competing theories about interactions between nutrients and invasions, we conducted a 2 x 3 factorial mesocosm experiment, varying western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) presence and nutrient availability within aquatic communities. Based on theory, increased nutrients could either (1) facilitate coexistence between predatory mosquitofish and native species by increasing prey availability (the invader attenuation hypothesis) or (2) strengthen predation effects by enhancing fish productivity more than native community members (the invader amplification hypothesis). In outdoor mesocosms designed to mimic observed nutrient conditions and local community structure, mosquitofish directly reduced the abundances of zooplankton and three native amphibian species, leading to indirect increases in phytoplankton, periphyton, and freshwater snail biomass through trophic cascades. Nutrient additions increased native amphibian growth but had especially pronounced effects on the productivity of invasive mosquitofish. The elevated nutrient condition supported ~5 times more juvenile mosquitofish and 30% higher biomass than the low nutrient condition. Increased nutrients levels did not weaken the top-down effects of mosquitofish on invertebrates or amphibians. Collectively, our results support the invader amplification hypothesis, suggesting that increased nutrient loading may benefit invasive species without attenuating their undesirable effects on native community members.
