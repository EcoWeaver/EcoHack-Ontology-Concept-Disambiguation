Studies on that substrate firstly focused on the associated organisms, but since a few years, identification of wood is a further aim. The purpose is to appreciate its degradation state, diversity, geographical origin and to identify specific associations between colonizing organisms and substrates. The first determinations were made on sunken woods from Taiwan/Philippines, the Vanuatu Archipelago, and the Mediterranean Sea. Samples' identification was based on histological studies. Different preparation techniques were used, depending on their degradation state. Detailed anatomy descriptions were made and compared to the native flora and the introduced species. Wood samples were well preserved. Diversified species were encountered, seemingly originating from local floras. In situ settlements of known wood species will enhance the knowledge of degradation and colonization degrees. To cite this article: M. Pailleret et al., C. R. Palevol 6 (2007).
