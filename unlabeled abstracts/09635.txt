Species richness and soil reaction in a Northeastern Oklahoma landscape
Although the relationship between soil reaction and species richness is of great theoretical interest, and has been relatively well studied in temperate latitudes, the southern Great Plains of North America have not received much attention. We analyzed the relationship between species richness and measures of soil reaction (pH, cation exchange capacity, Ca) in 418 10 m x 10 m samples (with nested smaller quadrats) in the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, Osage County, Oklahoma. We found a negative correlation of richness with soil reaction that is consistent across scales and years in grasslands, with soil calcium exhibiting the strongest relationships. The relationship in woodlands is weakly positive. The proportion of (primarily Eurasian) exotic species is positively related to calcium concentrations in both woodlands and grasslands. Although our results are not inconsistent with species pool hypotheses, critical tests of such hypotheses are operationally difficult.
