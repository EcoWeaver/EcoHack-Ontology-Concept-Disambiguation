Invasive Insects in the Mediterranean Forests of Chile
The Mediterranean ecosystem of Chile comprises the most populated region of the country as well as the most important passageways for international trade. This has caused the rate of introductions of exotic insects to be the highest of the country. As a consequence, it has been observed an increasing number of exotic insects currently being established in three different situations: natural forests, commercial forest plantations and urban trees. In natural forests, the most serious threat is the invasion of Cinara cupressi, causing severe damage on the endangered native Cupressaceae, Austrocedrus chilensis. Apart from this case, records of exotic insects attacking native trees are scarce. On the other hand, forest plantations of exotic species, mainly Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus spp., have been affected for several insect invasions in the last years. These new invasions represent a challenge for the Chilean forest industry, making necessary the adoption of new silvicultural techniques and sanitary protocols for exporting wood products. Besides commercial plantations, insect invasions are also taking place in urban areas: poplars, elms and other ornamental trees have undergone the introduction of several exotic insects. The effect of this pests has been perceived as a major threat for the environmental quality of cities, and public opinion is increasingly demanding actions from the government to minimize their effects. Considering the increasing rate of detection of exotic insects in Chile, it becomes clear that invasive insects represent a current threat for Chilean forests and immediate actions are needed from the government, private companies and society to minimize their negative consequences.
