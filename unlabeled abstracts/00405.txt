Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae): A New Invasive Pest in the United States
The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture recently reported the first detection of Lycorma delicatula (proposed common name spotted lanternfly), yet another invasive hemipteran pest in the US. While efforts to tackle other invasive hemipterans like the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri (Kuwayama), the Bagrada bug, Bagrada hilaris (Burmeister), and the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal) are still underway, L. delicatula is a new pest that could potentially impact industries ranging from lumber to wine. Here we review the literature regarding this insect in its native and invasive range in Asia. We also highlight the pest status and tentative management recommendations for this pest in North America.
