The trade-off between vegetative and generative reproduction among angiosperms influences regional hydrochorous propagule pressure
Aim Local communities are subject to spatiotemporal contingencies of landscape processes; community assembly is thus often considered to be unpredictable and idiosyncratic. However, evolved trade-offs of species' life histories may set distinct constraints on the assembly of species communities. In plants, the recruitment and invasion success of species into communities depend primarily on the number of propagules available and on their generative or vegetative character. Life-history trade-offs prevent individual plants from producing large numbers of both generative and vegetative propagules, but it is not clear whether this constrains their availability at the landscape scale. We thus tested whether: (1) the observed relationship between generative and vegetative propagules deviates from the null expectation stating that species contributing the bulk of generative propagules to the propagule rain should also contribute the bulk of vegetative propagules; and (2) whether vegetative and generative propagule pressures are negatively correlated once species abundance in the regional pool is accounted for.
