Electroantennogram responses of an invasive species fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea) to host volatile compounds
Electroantennogram responses of fall webworms (Hyphantria cunea) to 55 host volatile compounds were conducted. Results showed that male moths were more responsive to trans-2-hexenyl acetate, nonanal, hexanal, trans-2-hexenal, hexanol, isoamyl acetate, acetic acid cis-3-hexenyl ester, ethyl acetoacetate, citronellal and (+)-citronellal, and females were more responsive to hexanol, hexanal, acetophenone, isoamyl acetate, nonanal, trans-2-hexenal, acetic acid cis-3-hexenyl ester, citronellal, cis-3-hexen-1-ol and trans-2-hexen-1-ol. Seven bioactive compounds were also selected for further dosage response experiments, and a positive correlation was found between the fall webworm and the tested compounds. A maximum dosage level of 1000 mg was tested and found to elicit significantly higher activity from male moths compared with lower (1, 10, 100 mg) concentrations.
