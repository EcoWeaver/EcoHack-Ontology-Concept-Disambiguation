Current distribution of the invasive mollusk Corbicula fluminea (O.F. M&uuml;ller, 1774) (Bivalvia, Cyrenidae) in Brazil, including a new record from the state of Piau&iacute;
Corbicula fluminea is an invasive clam originally from Asia that threatens the biodiversity of freshwater communities around the world. It has greatly expanded in Brazil since its first record. We report here the occurrence of C. fluminea from Piau&iacute; state, Parna&iacute;ba river basin and, provide an assessment of its current distribution in Brazil. The compiled data include 382 records in 22 states and the Federal District, encompassing a variety of ecosystems. These results contribute to a discussion about the invasion and expansion process of C. fluminea in Brazil over time.
