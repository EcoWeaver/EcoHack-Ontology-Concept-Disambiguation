Alien species as sources of physiological traits for wheat improvement
Enhanced levels of drought, cold and salinity tolerance plus leaf photosynthesis and high protein content have been identified in species of Agropyron (Elytrigia) and Triticum (Aegilops). Because these characters, is most cases, are products of numerous metabolic pathways, they likely will have complex inheritance patterns and therefore may be difficult to transfer to bread wheat. However, all of the alien species in question are crossable with wheat. Most of the hybrids have been made and in many cases the material has been advanced to the state of addition lines which are available for screening. Where adequate screening tests are available, breeding techniques such as recurrent selection should be effective in transferring the traits.
