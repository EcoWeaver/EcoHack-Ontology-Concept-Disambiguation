Spreading to a limit: the time required for a neophyte to reach its maximum range
The average range size of alien plants in Spain reaches a maximum at 143 years. This is consistent with estimates of such a maximum in Ireland, Britain, Germany and the Czech Republic. A round figure of about 150 years on average for neophytes to reach their maximum range in European countries is indicated.
