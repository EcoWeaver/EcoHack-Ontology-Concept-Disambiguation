Patchy distribution of a fluvial sculpin,cottus nozawae, in the gakko river system at the southern margin of its native range
The distribution pattern of the freshwater sculpin,Cottus nozawae, was investigated in the Gakko River system, Tohoku District, northern Japan, that region representing the southern limit of the species distribution.C: nozawae was not found in the lower sections of the river, being instead restricted mainly to the upstream segments of some tributaries. The relationships between habitat variables and density ofC. nozawae analysed at reach scale, revealed that fish density increased with cover area, decreasing stream width and lower maximum water, temperature. Additionally, maximum water temperature was the best predictor of fish density according to stepwise multiple regression analysis. These data indicated that tributary populations ofC. nozawae were isolated from thermally unsuitable environments. Accordingly,C. nozawae was distributed patchily in headwater streams of this river system, in contrast to those on Hokkaido Island, where the species is distributed continuously throughout middle to upper stream courses.
