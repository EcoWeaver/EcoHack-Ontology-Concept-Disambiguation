Lizard predation alters the effect of habitat area on the species richness of insect assemblages on Bahamian isles
Aim Anolis lizard invasions are a serious threat world-wide, and information about how this invasive predator affects the diversity of prey assemblages is important for many strategic conservation goals. It is hypothesized that these predators reduce the slope of species-area relationships (SARs) of their prey assemblages. The effects of island area and predation by anolis lizards on the species richness of insular insect assemblages were investigated. Location Twenty-four isles around Staniel Cay, Exuma Cays, Bahamas. Methods Flying insects were sampled using half-sized Malaise traps for three consecutive days on each island in May 2007. First, the effect of island area on the probability of lizard presence was evaluated. Then, the effects of the presence-absence of predatory lizards on SARs were analysed for the overall insect assemblage and for the assemblages of five dominant insect orders. Results Our results indicated that anolis lizards occurred primarily on larger islands. The species richness of the overall insect assemblage and five dominant insect orders significantly increased with island area. The interaction between island area and predator presence-absence significantly affected the overall insect assemblage and Diptera and Hymenoptera assemblages (but not Coleoptera, Hemiptera and Lepidoptera assemblages). The presence of predators caused decreases in the slope of the SARs. Main conclusions The presence of predatory lizards strongly affects species richness of insular insect assemblages with the island area being a crucial determinant of the species richness. Therefore, the slope of the SAR can serve as a measure of the consequence of invasive predatory species on native insect assemblages.
