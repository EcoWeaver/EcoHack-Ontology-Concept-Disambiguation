Niche Occupation by Invasive Ground-Dwelling Predator Species in Canarian Laurel Forests
The distribution and co-occurrence of three groups of carnivorous soil macro-invertebrates (Carabidae, Staphylinidae, Chilopoda) were examined in laurel forests of the western Canary Islands. The species numbers per site decreased from East to West (La Gomera, El Hierro, La Palma) in both, beetles and centipedes. No evidence was found for the 'diversity-invasibility-hypothesis' sensu Elton. The number of invasive species per site increased with that of native species in Chilopoda, and was not significant in Carabidae+Staphylinidae. Carabidae and Staphylinidae were combined to form a guild of non-specialized ground-dwelling predatory beetles. The mandible length of adults and larvae was used as an indicator of the preferred food size class to determine the food niche width and niche separation. Two invasive coleopteran species were also examined: Ocypus olens occupied the vacant top predator niche on El Hierro, and Laemostenus complanatus occupied the vacant medium size predator niche on La Palma. Neither of these species was found in laurel forests of any other island where these niches are occupied by autochthonous species, though they are introduced on these islands too. The Chilopoda occurred in the forests with seven invasive and seven native species. Autochthonous and introduced centipedes species of the same size class and group are mutually exclusive.
