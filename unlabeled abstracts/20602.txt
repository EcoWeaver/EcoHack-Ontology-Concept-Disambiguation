Meloidogyne enterolobii (= M. mayaguensis): profile of an emerging, highly pathogenic, root-knot nematode species
Meloidogyne enterolobii (= M. mayaguensis), the root-knot nematode of the pacara earpod tree, belongs to the group of tropical root-knot nematodes and is considered as one of the most damaging species, due to its wide host range, pathogenicity and ability to develop and reproduce on several crops carrying resistance genes. Moreover, recent reports indicate that the geographic distribution of the parasite tends to extend beyond tropical areas, and the risk of its establishment and spread in Mediterranean regions and southern Europe is now highly probable. Recently, molecular markers have been developed that allow the specific identification of this pest, a prerequisite for the implementation of efficient control strategies. In that respect, plant resistance and biological control are currently being actively investigated but a huge amount of research and development is still required to ensure the successful use of such methods in the field.
