Genetic differentiation of invasive Aedes albopictus by RAPD-PCR: implications for effective vector control
Aedes albopictus is an invasive mosquito species of great concern to public health as it is responsible for the biological transmission of several pathogens causing dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, etc. In 2009, this mosquito was detected for the first time in Agra City. This study represents the first genetic analysis of A. albopictus from India. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) was used to study the genetic structure of A. albopictus in four populations from different larval habitats. Seven RAPD primers produced 141 loci. The results displayed rich genetic variation among larval populations which is evident from high value of genetic differentiation (G ST), i.e. 0.280, indicating a very great genetic differentiation. Effective migration rates were observed to be 1.28, depicting a limited gene flow. According to analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), the genetic distance between populations was significant (P < 0.05), showing a very high intrapopulation variation (96 %) with only 4 % variation among populations. Average genetic distances between populations were also calculated using PopGene software. Nei's average genetic distance between these populations was 0.112 (0.05-0.18). The cluster analysis technique of unweighted pair-group mean analysis (UPGMA) method of arithmetic averages was used to develop the phylogenetic tree which clearly shows two clusters of different larval habitats. The findings highlight high genetic differentiation indicating a slight migration rate confirming the recent introduction of this species in Agra region.
