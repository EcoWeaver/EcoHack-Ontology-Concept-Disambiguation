The Biology of Invasive Alien Plants in Canada. 11. Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb., T. chinensis Lour. and hybrids
These Tamarix species and their hybrids, known collectively as saltcedar, are perennial small trees or shrubs native to Eurasia, and were among the Tamarix species introduced to the United States in 1800s as ornamentals, for plantings in windbreaks, and to stabilize eroding stream banks. They have since escaped and become damaging invasive plants in large areas of the western and Great Plains regions of the United States. They are able to reproduce vigorously by both seed and vegetative propagation, and are persistent and long-lived once established. Ecological problems include hydrologic impacts, displacement of native flora and fauna including endangered species, and excretion of salt, which increases soil salinity. Economic impacts include costs associated with control as well as losses of irrigation and municipal water, flood control costs, and loss of recreational opportunities. Invaded habitats include floodplains, salt flats, marshes, reservoirs, stock watering ponds, and irrigation ditches. Saltcedar is difficult to control and almost impossible to eradicate once established. In 2007, naturalized saltcedar was found near Penticton and at Osoyoos Lake in British Columbia, Canada. It is also currently sold in several Canadian provinces as an ornamental. Ecological niche modelling indicates that large areas of the Canadian Prairies are susceptible to invasion. Hybridization, multiple intentional introductions through garden plantings, natural dispersal from populations in the northern United States, and climate warming will increase the risk and promote the spread of saltcedar in Canada.
