The first established population of the invasive silverfish Ctenolepisma longicaudata (Escherich) in the Czech Republic
The silverfish Ctenolepisma longicaudata (Escherich) (Zygentoma, Lepismatidae) is an invasive, synanthropic, warehouse, and economic pest, probably of Central American origin. During recent decades, its occasional occurrence has been recorded from some European countries. Here, we report the first established population of C. longicaudata within the territory of the Czech Republic. In the autumn 2017, the population was discovered in a warehouse and surrounding office buildings in Prague. Since this species causes damage to starch components and fabrics as well as food contamination, we strongly recommend further monitoring and possibly eradication.
