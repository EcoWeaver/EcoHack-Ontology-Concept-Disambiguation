Across islands and continents, mammals are more successful invaders than birds (Reply to Rodriguez-Cabalet al.)
In their reply to Jeschke (2008), Rodriguez-Cabal et al. (2009) argue that the underlying 'data are inadequate to draw strong conclusions about the tens rule or invasibility of islands and continents'. They point out that especially for taxa such as insects or plants, many species introductions are unknown, hence fractions of species that have become established are often overestimated. I agree but would like to add that in Jeschke (2008), I analysed the two well-studied taxa of mammals and birds. Even data from these taxa are imperfect, so they need to be analysed carefully. At least from my perspective, the analyses underlying Jeschke (2008) were done carefully. I thus stand by my original conclusions.
