An invaded wet ecosystem in Central Italy: An arrangement and evidence for an alien food chain
The aim of this work is to provide an account of alien species richness and composition in a remnant Mediterranean coastal wetland of Central Italy. Data were obtained from different taxa-specific methods, in 2001-2005 (terrestrial vertebrates) and in 2005 (fish, arthropoda, mollusca). Among the 353 species sampled, 17 (4.8 %) are aliens (7.1% if we consider only vertebrates).Data on abundance, introduction type and status of alien species are reported. A crustacean, Procambarus clarkii, a fish, Gambusia sp. and three rodents, Myocastor coypus, Rattus norvegicus and Mus domesticus are the naturalized invasive species that locally could constitute a threat on economic and ecological levels. Data on Agapornis nigrigenis and Quelea cardinalis represent the first records for Italy. We also report evidence of a food chain on three levels, among the most invasive species (predation of Gambusia sp. by Procambarus clarkii and of Rattus norvegicus on Procambarus clarkii).
