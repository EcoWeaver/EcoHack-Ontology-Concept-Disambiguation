An Analysis of Otter Lutra lutra Predation on Introduced American Crayfish Procambarus clarkii in Iberian Streams
1. Patterns of otter, Lutra lutra, predation on introduced American crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, were examined in an Iberian intermittent stream over a 2-year period, in order to assess the relative importance to otters of this new food resource. Diet was described from spraints collected monthly, and the importance of different prey types was determined in terms of their relative numeric and energetic contributions to the diet. Monthly fluctuations in diet and abundance of principal prey species were compared. 2. Energetically, the crayfish ranked second after eels, accounting for 18% of the estimated annual intake of energy. Crayfish and eels were particularly important in the diet from April to October. For the rest of the year, crayfish accounted for
