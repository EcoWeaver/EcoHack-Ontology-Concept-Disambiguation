Endozoochory by free-ranging, large herbivores: Ecological correlates and perspectives for restoration
Seed dispersal via ingestion and defecation by large herbivores provides a possible aid for ecological restoration of plant communities, by connecting source communities of target species with habitat restoration sites. It is also a possible threat due to invasion of weeds, grasses or exotic species. Insight into the factors determining internal seed dispersal could therefore improve the management of grazed ecosystems. We recorded viable seed density in cattle, sheep and pony dung samples and monitored dung pat colonisation in the field. In addition, we counted the distribution of dung pats in plots spread over all habitat units in our study site. The three herbivore species appeared to disperse large quantities of many species (61 in total) from a variety of plant families, monocots as well as dicots. The density of viable seeds in herbivore dung and the colonisation of dung pats were positively correlated with Ellenberg nitrogen indicator values and seed supply, but not with seed mass or shape. The results imply that many seeds are dispersed from high productive to low productive parts of the grazed area. In free-ranging systems, we therefore recommend enclosure and separate management of plant communities on nutrient-poor soils with high conservation interest. For habitat restoration sites we recommend integrated grazing only with target plant communities on nutrient-poor soils and not with plant communities on nutrient-richer soils.
