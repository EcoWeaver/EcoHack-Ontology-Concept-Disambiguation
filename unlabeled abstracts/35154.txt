The Influence of Diet and Population Density on Maturation of Females from Native and Invasive Populations of the Multicolored Asian Ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae)
Population density can influence insect reproduction both directly and indirectly causing quantitative and qualitative changes in the feeding regime. We investigated the impact of diet and population density on reproductive maturation of females from native (Irkutsk) and invasive (Sochi) populations of the multicolored Asian ladybird Harmonia axyridis. During the study the beetles fed either on the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, or on less suitable factitious food (eggs of the grain moth Sitotroga cerealella). Population density was determined by the number of females and males placed in a standard Petri dish. The experiments showed that feeding on the grain moth eggs (other conditions being equal) delayed maturation and increased the tendency to enter reproductive diapause in females from the native but not from the invasive population of H. axyridis. In addition, the preoviposition period increased with the number of females but decreased with the number of males in a dish, although these effects were observed only in individuals from the invasive population and their strength depended on the food of the beetles. Earlier we have demonstrated that the impact of the density-dependent factors on the larvae of the invasive population of H. axyridis was stronger than that on the larvae of the native population because the larvae of the invasive population have somewhat more aggressive interactions with competitors. In the present study, similar differences were revealed between females of these populations.
