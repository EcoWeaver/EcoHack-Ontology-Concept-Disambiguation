Invasion of maritime chaparral by the introduced succulentCarpobrotus edulis : The roles of fire and herbivory.
Invasion by the alien succulent,Carpobrotus edulis, has become a common occurrence after fire in maritime chaparral in coastal California, USA. We studied post-burnCarpobrotus establishment in chaparral that lackedCarpobrotus plants before the fire and compared seedbank and field populations in adjacent burned and unburned stands.Carpobrotus seeds were abundant in deer scat and in the soil before burning. Burning did not enhance germination: many seeds were apparently killed by fire and seed bank cores taken after fire revealed no germinable seeds. Laboratory tests showed that temperatures over 105degC for five minutes killedCarpobrotus seeds. In a field experiment involving use of herbivore exclosures, we found that herbivory was an important source of mortality for seedlings in both burned and unburned chaparral. All seedlings, however, died outside of the burn regardless of the presence of cages. Establishment there is apparently limited by factors affecting plant physiology. In the burned area, seedlings that escaped herbivory grew very rapidly. Overall, it appears that herbivory limited seedling establishment in both burned and unburned sites but that the post-burn soil environment supportedCarpobrotus growth in excess of herbivore use, thus promoting establishment.
