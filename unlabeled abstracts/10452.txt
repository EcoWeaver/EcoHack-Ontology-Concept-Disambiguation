Micropogonias undulatus(L.), another exotic arrival in European waters
Two living specimens of the Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus have been caught during recent years in Belgian waters (Southern Bight of the North Sea): one in August 1998 as a by-catch of the commercial shrimp fishery in coastal waters, another in October 2001 on a tidal flat in the brackish part of the Scheldt Estuary. These represent the first records of this north-west Atlantic species in European waters, and their occurrence is likely to be due to transportation in ship ballast water.
