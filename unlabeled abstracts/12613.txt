EFFECT OF CITIZEN ACTION ON SUPPRESSION OF INVASIVE ALIEN LIZARD POPULATION: A CASE OF THE REMOVAL OF EUTROPIS MULTIFASCIATA ON GREEN ISLAND, TAIWAN
This paper analyzes data from the 2009-2016 projects for the removal of the invasive alien species Eutropis multifasciata from Green Island, Taiwan. In this study, the perimeter trapping method was used, and the validity of the method was verified at the beginning of the study. The result showed that the exponential regression analysis showed a statistically significant negative relationship between capture rate and time. Thus perimeter trapping was indeed an effective way of removing E. multifasciata. Besides, it investigates whether citizen action can assist in the removal of invasive alien species. The process of removal occurred in two stages; the first was funded by government, and the second involved citizen action. When citizens took over the work of removal, the size of the animals removed continued to decrease, as did the ratio of alien to indigenous individuals captured. In this case, introducing citizen action was an effective method of removing this invasive alien species.
