Clonal variation in physiological parameters of Alexandrium tamarense: implications for biological invasions and maintenance
The study of the intraspecific variability is a crucial step for understanding the successful establishment and maintenance of invasive species. Alexandrium tamarense strains isolated in spring 2007 from a single bloom in Thau lagoon have been grown on three different media (ESNW based on natural seawater, and the artificial media, ESAW, ESAW+HA). A large diversity in the ability of strains to grow on these media was found. Irrespective of medium composition, growth curves followed three models: (1) a classical shape, (2) a population crash followed in some cases (3) by growth recovery. Some strains were able to show significant growth in an environment completely artificial (ESAW). ANOVA indicated a significant difference between groups in growth rates allowing the distinction of contrasted categories among the strains studied in ESNW medium. These statistical tests also indicated the presence of distinct groups among the strains grown in the ESAW as well as for those on ESAW+HA medium. Lag phases were extremely variable between strains in all environments, suggesting a high variability of adaptation to the environment. The results revealed that wide fitness variations were exhibited by diverse conspecific A. tamarense individuals co-existing during a bloom.
