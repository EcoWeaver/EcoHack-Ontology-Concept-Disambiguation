A non-invasive morphometric technique for estimating cestode plerocercoid burden in small freshwater fish
A non-invasive morphometric technique is presented which can be used to predict the infection status and the proportion of infected fish weight contributed by parasite tissue in three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus infected with plerocercoids of Schistocephalus solidus (Cestoda: Pseudophyllidea)
