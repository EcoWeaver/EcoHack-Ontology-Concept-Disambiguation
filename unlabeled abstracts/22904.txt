Invasive Fire Ants Depredate Nest of Florida Scrub-Jay
We observed depredation of a Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) nest of 4-day-old nestlings in April 2008 by the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta). This exotic species is known to depredate nests of other avian species, but we believe this is the first account of this species of fire ant preying upon young of the Florida Scrub-Jay. This observation is particularly important, as it entails an introduced species directly reducing reproductive success of a federally threatened species.
