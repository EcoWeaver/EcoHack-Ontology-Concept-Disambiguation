Intermediate-disturbance hypothesis
The hypothesis combines the development of a community over time as species are added with environmental disturbance, either physical or biological. The temporal pattern is for diversity to increase until resources become limiting and then declines over time as resources are contested. Any disruption or disturbance of this process can reset the community to some earlier state. High rates of disturbance will keep the community in an early stage with few species and low rates of disturbance will allow competitive exclusion to reduce diversity. Therefore, some rate or magnitude of disturbance should exist that maintains the community in an intermediate developmental state of highest diversity. Strong and weak competitors, good and poor colonizers, can all coexist when disturbance prevents the monopolization of resources and the loss of species.
