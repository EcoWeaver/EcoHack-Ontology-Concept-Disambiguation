Naturalization of the Manila clam (Tapes philippinarum), an alien species, and establishment of a clam fishery within Poole Harbour, Dorset
The first known occurrence of a naturalized population of Manila clam (Tapes philippinarum) in UK waters is reported. Introduced into Poole Harbour for aquaculture in 1988; by 1994 local fishermen and wading birds began to exploit this northernmost naturalized population in Europe. The licensed fishery currently supports 31 local fishers, landing approximately 250 tn. of clams in 2002. The current distribution of the clam in Poole Harbour, the biology of this naturalized population and the ecological impact of its introduction and fishery, is described.
