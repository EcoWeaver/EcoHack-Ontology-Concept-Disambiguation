A newly established round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) population in the upper stretch of the river Elbe
The invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus, Pallas, 1814) has increased its European range dramatically over recent decades, with international shipping suspected as the main vector. Here, we provide the first population and morphological data for a newly established round goby population in the upper Elbe (Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic). Surveys in 2013 along the same stretch found no evidence of gobies, indicating introduction within the past two years. Analysis of morphological similarity confirms the most likely source as the recently established population in the tidal Elbe near the port of Hamburg. Due to the species' restricted range (
