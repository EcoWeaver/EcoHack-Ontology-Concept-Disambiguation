Invasive fishes in the Hawaiian anchialine ecosystem: investigating potential predator avoidance by endemic organisms
Globally, introductions of alien species are increasingly common, with invasive predators potentially having detrimental effects via predation on native species. However, native prey may avoid predation by adopting new behaviors. To determine whether invasive fish populations consume endemic shrimp in invaded Hawaiian anchialine habitats or if adopted patterns of diel migration prevents predation as previously hypothesized, a total of 183 invasive poeciliids (158 Gambusia affinis and 25 Poecilia reticulata) were collected for gut content analyses from four anchialine sites during wet and dry seasons on the islands of Hawai'i and Maui. Predation on shrimp was not detected in habitats where they retreat exclusively into the underlying aquifer diurnally and only emerge nocturnally. However, low levels of predation were detected (7/65 fishes, only by Gambusia affinis) at Waianapanapa Cave, Maui, where shrimp retreat into both the aquifer and a cave during the day. Thus, adopted behavioral responses to invasive fishes generally, though not universally, prevent predation on endemic Hawaiian anchialine shrimps. However, non-consumptive effects resulting from behavioral modification of shrimps may have appreciable impacts on the Hawaiian anchialine ecosystem and warrant further study.
