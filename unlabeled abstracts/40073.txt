The fauna fights back: invasive Cane Toads killed by native centipedes in tropical Australia
ABSTRACT We report two cases of Cane Toads Rhinella marina being killed by Australasian Giant Centipedes Ethmostigmus rubripes in the Northern Territory. At 1730 h on 12 November 2020, a centipede was found attacking a subadult Cane Toad near Larrimah, Northern Territory. At 2015 h on 26 April 2005, near Humpty Doo, a centipede that was seized by a subadult Cane Toad retaliated and killed its attacker (but did not consume it). These observations reinforce the fact that, contrary to popular opinion, Cane Toads are vulnerable to many species of native predators in Australia.
