Native Species Abundance Buffers Non-Native Plant Invasibility following Intermediate Forest Management Disturbances
Abstract The biotic resistance hypothesis (BRH) was proposed to explain why intermediate disturbances lead to greater resistance to non-native invasions proposing communities that are more diverse provide greater resistance. However, several empirical data sets have rejected the BRH because native and non-native species richness often have a positive relation. We tested the BRH in a mature loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forest with a gradient of disturbance intensities including canopy reduction, canopy reduction + fire, and canopy reduction + herbicide and fire. We analyzed data from the study using a combination of Pearson's correlation and beta regressions. Using species richness, we too would reject BRH because of a positive correlation in species richness between native and non-native plants. However, native species abundance was greatest, and non-native species abundance was lowest following intermediate disturbances. Further, native and non-native species abundances were negatively correlated in a quadratic relation across disturbance intensities, suggesting that native species abundance, rather than richness, may be the mechanism of resistance to non-native invasions. We propose that native species abundance regulates resistance to non-native invasions and that intermediate disturbances provide the greatest resistance because they promote the greatest native species abundance.
