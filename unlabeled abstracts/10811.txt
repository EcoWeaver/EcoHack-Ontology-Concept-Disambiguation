Tracking the introduction history of Ichthyosaura alpestris in a protected area of Central Spain
One of the main goals of protected areas, especially National Parks, is biodiversity conservation. Taking into account the multiple negative impacts that allochthonous animals can cause in an ecosystem, it is important to know and track the introductions in order to take efficient management measures to enhance biodiversity conservation. We study the origin of an Ichthyosaura alpestris population in Penalara Massif within the Guadarrama National Park, Central Spain. To accomplish this goal, we used nine microsatellite markers and sequences from 16S and ND4 genes. Both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite analyses showed the close relationship between Penalara and Asturian populations, despite their geographical distance, confirming the allochthonous origin of this population. Interestingly, more than one introduction event seems to have occurred with individuals from Lago Ercina and Pozos de Lloroza populations participating in the founding of the Penalara population. Due to predation, competition and transmission of diseases enhanced by its ongoing expansion, I. alpestris population might be considered a threat to Penalara biodiversity. We advise an efficient population control to conserve the biodiversity within the Guadarrama National Park and an update of the position of this population in the Spanish indexes and list of species.
