Little evidence of native and non-native species influencing one another's abundance and distribution in the herb layer of an oak woodland
QuestionTo what extent are species, including native and non-native species, influencing one another's distribution and abundance in the herb layer of a Minnesota oak woodland?LocationOak woodland succeeding into a more mesic forest, on bluffland of the Mississippi River, east-central Minnesota.Methods We collected plant composition and species cover data in 182 1.0 x 0.5 m quadrats regularly spaced on a 6-ha study grid in the oak woodland. We also recorded slope, slope position, aspect, elevation and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at each quadrat.ResultsPresence and abundance of other plant species, topographic variables and light availability explained only a small portion of the variation (5-19%) in the distribution and abundance of individual species. The most common strongest predictor of cover for the ten most common species was species richness, with the association being positive. The non-native species, garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) exhibited the strongest positive association with species richness. Only one of the 45 pair-wise comparisons of the ten species resulted in a negative relationship between the species. Abundance and distribution of two species were associated with topographic features, but this accounted for much less of the variation in abundance than did species richness.Conclusion We found little evidence that competition or any other interactions among common herb layer species, including the non-native Alliaria petiolata, play an important role in determining the abundance and the distribution of herb layer species in this oak woodland. Topographic factors may explain a small amount of the distribution and abundance patterns of a few species. But, for the most part, species are more likely to be present when other species are present, suggesting that they are simply establishing in microsites favourable to plants in general.
