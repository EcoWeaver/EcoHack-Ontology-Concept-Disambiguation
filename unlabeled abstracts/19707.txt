Comparative biological characteristics of zander Sander lucioperca (L.) in Lakes Onega and Vygozero
The work on the introduction of the zander Sander lucioperca (L.) from Lake Onega to Lake Vygozero is reviewed. A comparative analysis is performed for the biological parameters of zander from these lakes. The zander population from Lake Vygozero differs from that of Lake Onega in its lower growth rate, later maturation, and lower fat content of internal organs; these differences are determined by the limnological parameters and food supplies of both waterbodies.
