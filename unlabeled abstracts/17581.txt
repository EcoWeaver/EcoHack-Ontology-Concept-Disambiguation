Overestimation of establishment success of non-native birds in Hawaii and Britain
The tens rules states that 10 % of all introduced species establish and about 10 % of those species become invasive. Several studies have failed to support the tens rule. However, these studies are beset by a general weakness: many unsuccessful invasions are never reported, and without these data tests of the tens rules are inadequate. Here, using data on the establishment success of non-native birds in Hawaii and Britain and comparing these data with those from a previous study, we show that lack of information about failed species introductions, and the tendency to report species that have become invasive more than those that have not, result in an overesti-mate of the establishment success and invasion rates of non-native species.
