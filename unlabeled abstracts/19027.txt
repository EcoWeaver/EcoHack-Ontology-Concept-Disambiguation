Native, alien, endemic, threatened, and extinct species diversity in European countries
While species diversity patterns at large scales (continental to global) have been increasingly studied recently for a few well-known taxa, only a few studies have included less well-known groups, and analysed congruence patterns between taxa. By using data from nine taxonomic groups (vascular plants, bryophytes, mammals, birds, reptiles, freshwater fish, amphibians, butterflies, dragonflies) from 38 European countries and Israel, we analysed the diversity of five diversity subsets (numbers of native, endemic, threatened, extinct, alien species) and their cross-taxon species diversity congruency.
