Occurrence of Barred Knifejaw, Oplegnathus Fasciatus (Actinopterygii: Perciformes: Oplegnathidae), in Malta (Central Mediterranean) with a Discussion on Possible Modes of Entry
The barred knifejaw, Oplegnathus fasciatus (Temminck et Schlegel, 1844), a species native to the North Western and Eastern Central Pacific, is recorded from the central Mediterranean for the first time. Two individuals were photographed within a month of each other in Grand Harbour and in Marsamxett Harbour, Malta. It seems likely that the fish were introduced by shipping and different scenarios how this may have happened are discussed.
