Population Response of Giant Galapagos Tortoises to Feral Goat Removal
Efforts to eradicate nonnative mammals to restore oceanic island ecosystems have become increasingly successful but parallel tracking of response by native species for which control efforts are intended to benefit has been rare. A major campaign to eradicate nonnative goats and burros was initiated in 1995 on Alcedo Volcano in the Galapagos Archipelago that ultimately removed 62,868 goats and eliminated them by 2006. Planners of the eradication program had the foresight to invest in intensive monitoring of the status of the volcano's giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra) population whose welfare was a primary motivation for the eradication effort. Monitoring revealed an increase in the proportion of juveniles among all tortoises as well as increased growth rates of individual tortoises on Alcedo Volcano from earlier to later phases of the eradication campaign. Over the same time frame in a control population on nearby Santa Cruz Island (where goats and donkeys were not removed) juvenile fraction and individual growth rates remained unchanged. Although goat removal coincided with occurrence of a rare climatic event that simultaneously boosted forage availability for tortoises, failure to observe a comparable improvement in the control population implies that removal of goats and burros was the primary causative factor of improving population status of tortoises on Alcedo Volcano.
