A European ground beetle, Harpalus tardus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Carabidae), in Canterbury, and the predisposition of European carabids to establish in exotic temperate locations
The European ground beetle Harpalus tardus has recently established on the Port Hills, Christchurch. Characters are given to distinguish it from H. affinis, the other species of Harpalus established in New Zealand, and from the superficially similar Anisodactylus binotatus. Six species of European Harpalus are now known to have established in North America and/or New Zealand. Based on the ecology of H. tardus in Europe, it is unlikely to cause significant adverse impact in New Zealand and may even become a beneficial component of the predatory fauna in exotic grasslands.
