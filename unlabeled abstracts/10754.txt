Biology of the exotic zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, in relation to native bivalves and its potential impact in Lake St. Clair
The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is a new exotic species that was introduced into the Great Lakes as early as the fall of 1985. It differs markedly from native species of bivalves in its: (i) shell form; (ii) mode of life; (iii) reproductive potential; (iv) larval life cycle; (v) population dynamics; (vi) distribu- tion, (vii) dispersal mechanisms; (viii) physiology; (ix) potential impact on the ecosystem; and (x) impact on society and the economy. In body form, it has an anterior umbone, a flat ventral surface with permanent aperature for the byssal apparatus and a shape that together make the animal well adapted for life on a hard surface. The shell has a zebra-stripe pattern, a heteromyarian muscle condition and lacks hinge teeth which make it easily identifiable from native bivalves. The zebra mussel is strongly byssate and has an epifaunal mode of life not seen in native bivalves. The species is dioecious and has external fertilization, the eggs developing into pelagic veligers which remains planktonic for approximately 4 weeks. Gametogenesis begins in late winter to early spring, veligers appear in the water column in late May to early June and disappear in mid to late October in Lake St. Clair. Adults live for about 2 years and have very rapid growth rates. Maximum shell lengths average 2.3 to 2.5 cm. Standing crops as high as 200000 m -2 are present in the l-m depths of the Ontario shores. Infestations may be interfering with the normal metabolism of native unionid clams and there is potential of the unionid clam populations being reduced or even eliminated from Lake St. Clair.
