Identifying factors determining the altitudinal distribution of the invasive pest leafminers Liriomyza huidobrensis and Liriomyza sativae
Abiotic and biotic factors that change with altitude can influence the distribution of herbivorous insects. We examined factors influencing the distribution of the generalist leafminers Liriomyza sativae Blanchard and Liriomyza huidobrensis Blanchard (Diptera: Agromyzidae), two pests of agricultural crops, in the tropical Dieng mountainous area of Central Java, Indonesia. Liriomyza huidobrensis predominated at altitudes above 700 m a.s.l. and was the only species collected above 1 400 m a.s.l. In contrast, L. sativae predominated below 600 m a.s.l. and was not found above 1 200 m where the average temperature was 20.7 degC. Parasitoid diversity decreased with altitude, but parasitism did not change. The distribution of neither species was affected by parasitoids; L. huidobrensis predominant at high altitudes was preferred by Opius parasitoids common at these altitudes. Intra- and interspecific competition was detected in laboratory experiments where larval density was high, but led to coexistence rather than species displacement. No competition was detected in a field experiment when larval density was low. However, L. sativae failed to reproduce at the highest altitude, whereas L. huidobrensis established at all altitudes. Host composition varied with altitude and one host (faba beans) preferred by L. huidobrensis was common at high altitudes. By relating published data on the performance of the leafminer species to altitudinal temperature changes, we were partly successful in predicting the altitude at which the dominant species switched. Temperature plays an overriding influence on the altitudinal distribution of leafminers.
