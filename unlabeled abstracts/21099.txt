Aquatic Invaders: Sea Grant/AZA project explains pathways to zoo and aquarium audiences
University researchers and government agency scientists can join new allies in efforts to increase public understanding of aquatic invasive species. More than 200 "free choice learning" centers accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, along with Sea Grant programs across the United States, have received Aquatic Invaders program toolkits as part of an outreach project funded by NOAA's National Sea Grant College Program. Surveys results show that the AZA educators have already reached audiences totaling at least 10, 000 with messages to limit the introduction and spread of AIS. The educators also report significant increases in their own understanding of invasive species. The kit reflects a successful project that brought together scientists and educators for a program designed on a national scale, yet can be adapted for local use/emphasis.
