Hares in Corsica: high prevalence of Lepus corsicanus and hybridization with introduced L. europaeus and L. granatensis
The Italian hare, Lepus corsicanus, was first described in Corsica more than 100 years ago, but the knowledge on the status of the species in this island remains scarce. Moreover, frequent introductions of thousands of individuals from other hare species, namely Lepus europaeus and Lepus granatensis, into Corsica are known to have occurred and an updated assessment of the prevalence of L. corsicanus in Corsica is therefore of utmost importance. Here, to estimate the relative prevalence of the hare species present in Corsica, we conducted a molecular analysis on 67 samples collected by hunters between 2002 and 2007 in 36 Corsican communes. Sequencing of portions of the nuclear gene transferrin and of the control region of the mitochondrial DNA allowed classifying most of the collected samples as belonging to L. corsicanus (70.1%). Of the sampled Corsican communes, 86.1% contained this species, while only in 11.1%, L. europaeus was present. Three of the analyzed specimens showed an inconsistent molecular assignment between markers suggesting a hybrid origin: L. corsicanus x L. europaeus, L. corsicanus x L. granatensis, and L. europaeus x L. granatensis. The first two cases of hybridization had never been described in nature, even in studies focusing on hares from Italy where L. corsicanus and L. europaeus are often sympatric. These results stress the real risk of corrosion of the native gene pool of L. corsicanus via hybridization with introduced species. We highlight the need of urgently rethinking the management plan of hare populations in Corsica. KeywordsConservation-Corsica-Italian hare-Hybridization- Lepus -Introduced species
