Ability of predatory native Australian fishes to learn to avoid toxic larvae of the introduced toad Bufo marinus
Of two native Australian fishes naive to the introduced toad Bufo marinus most barramundi Lates calcarifer rapidly learned to avoid B. marinus tadpoles, while sooty grunter Hephaestus fuliginosus exhibited considerable intraspecific variation in their learning ability. Some sooty grunter learned to avoid tadpoles after only a few attacks, while other individuals continued to attack and reject tadpoles throughout the entire laboratory trials. Individuals of both species recognized and avoided tadpoles 1 day after their previous encounter. None of the fishes died during the trials. The observed variation in behavioural responses of fishes to B. marinus may be due to differences in (1) learning ability, (2) fish hunger levels, and or (3) tadpole palatability and toxicity. The results demonstrate that most barramundi and sooty grunter learn to avoid B. marinus tadpoles with minimal trauma. Consequently, it is anticipated that the toads are unlikely to have a significant negative impact on wild populations of these fishes through direct toxic effects.
