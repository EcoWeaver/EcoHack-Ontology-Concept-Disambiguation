Biofouling in Brazilian commercial cultivation of Kappaphycus alvarezii (Doty) Doty ex P. C. Silva
Biofouling filamentous red algae have been responsible for disease and costly loss of productivity in Asian Kappaphycus farms. Despite this, there is little information on the composition of biofouling composition organisms, their origin and their influence on commercial seaweed production. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify biofouling organisms at three Kappaphycus alvarezii commercial farms in southeastern Brazil and the influence of biofouling on commercial cultivation of this seaweed using floating rafts system between May 2008 and August 2009. Environmental factors had a greater influence on biofouling community composition than temporal factors. Not all the organisms found on the cultivation rafts and seedlings are the same as those on adjacent rocky shores. Foliose and filamentous algae were dominant biofoulers at the site with lower water movement and were easier to manage. The site with higher hydrodynamics was dominated by calcareous organisms which reduced K. alvarezii production by causing the rafts to sink, decreasing solar irradiance; together with greater water movement, this hampered cleaning of the cultivation structures. Endobionts were not found. Seedlings of K. alvarezii were not found fixed at sampling sites and adjacent rocky shores, indicating that the introduced species had not escaped to the wild.
