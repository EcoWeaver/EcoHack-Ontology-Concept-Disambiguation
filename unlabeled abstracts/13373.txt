Mitochondrial cox1 and cob sequence diversities in Gelidium vagum (Gelidiales, Rhodophyta) in Korea
The number of species of non-native and invasive marine algae is growing, with concomitant public concern about native ecosystems and coastlines. Gelidium vagum, recently introduced from northeast Asia to Europe and North America, commonly occurs from the intertidal to subtidal zones in Korea, China, and Japan. To investigate the level of genetic diversity of native populations, we analyzed mitochondrial cox1 and cob from 108 specimens of G. vagum from Korea, China, eastern Russia, including from the Netherlands and USA. The haplotype network of individual and cox1 + cob datasets revealed no genetic structure in local populations, suggesting genetic flow between Korean populations. Our results corroborate a typical pattern of genetic diversity for introduced species, with low levels in introduced populations and high levels in native populations. All haplotypes were shared between the Netherlands and USA, but not between Korea and the Netherlands / USA except cox1. Additional sampling will identify donor populations in native northeast Asian waters. This is the first report of the utility of the mitochondrial coding cob sequences in red algae.
