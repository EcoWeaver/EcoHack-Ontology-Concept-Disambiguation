Ecological implications of harp seal Phoca groenlandica invasions in northern Norway
In the years since 1978, Barents Sea harp seals Phoca groenlandica have appeared in large numbers in Finnmark, North Norway, in February-May. The size of the "seal invasions" increased dramatically in 1987 and 1988 when large seal herds were observed along the coast of North Norway in January-August. The seal invasions gave rise to seal-fisheries conflicts. In addition to consuming fish (capelin, cod, saithe and haddock), the seals caused substantial damage to gill-nets and gill-net catches. The presence of seals may also have resulted in the emigration of commercial species from traditional fishing grounds to deeper strata or areas unsuitable for fishing. Reduced recruitment to the seal population seems to have prevailed during most of the seal invasion period with particularly dramatic effects in 1986-1988, when first-year-mortality may have been almost total. Food shortage, particularly the two important prey species capelin and herring, is discussed as a possible factor contributing to the seal invasions.
