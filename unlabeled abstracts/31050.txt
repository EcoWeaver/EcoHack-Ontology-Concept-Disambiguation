Contrasting impacts of a native and an invasive exotic shrub on flood-plain succession
Question: How do Coriaria arborea, an N-fixing native shrub. and Buddleja davidii, a non-N-fixing exotic shrub, affect N:P stoichiometry in plants and soils during early stages of primary Succession on a flood-plain? Location: Kowhai River Valley, northeast South Island, New Zealand. Methods: We measured soil and foliar nutrient concentrations. light levels, plant Community composition and the above-ground biomass of Coriaria and Buddleja in four successional stages: open. young. vigorous and mature. Results: Coriaria occurred at low density but dominated above-L,round biomass by the vigorous stage. Buddleja occurred at 5.3 +/- 1.0 stems/m(2) in the young stage and reached a maximum biomass of 520-535 g.m(-2) during the young and vigorous stages. Mineral soil N increased with above-ground Coriaria biomass (r(2) = 0.45). but did not vary with Buddleja biomass. In contrast. soil P increased with Buddleja biomass (r(2) = 0.35). but not with Coriaria biomass. In early successional stages. 70-80% of the species present were exotic, but this declined to about 15% by the mature stage. Exotic plant species richness declined with increasing Coriaria biomass, but no other measures of diversity varied with either Coriaria or Buddleja biomass. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that Buddleja dominates early succession and accumulates P whereas Coriaria dominates later succession and accumulates N. A key ecosystem effect of the invasive exotic Budlleja is alteration of soil N:P stoichiometry.
