A note on the relationships between visitor interest and characteristics of the mammal exhibits in Recife Zoo, Brazil
There are few quantitative studies on visitor's behaviour towards animal exhibits in zoos. We evaluated the popularity of mammal exhibits of a small tropical zoo at Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, and correlated it with some characteristics of the exhibits (number of individuals within the exhibit, species body mass, annual maintenance costs, exhibit frontage, and distance between the exhibit and the zoo entrance). We also compared popularity, body mass and annual maintenance costs between native and non-native species. A total of 27 exhibits were studied from December 2000 to May 2001. There was not any correlation between popularity and exhibit features. Although exotic species are heavier and have higher annual maintenance costs than native species, no difference in popularity between exotic and native species was found. Small zoos in tropical countries may redirect at least part of their exhibits from larger-bodied, exotic and more expensive towards smaller, native and cheaper mammal species without compromise to visitor's interest.
