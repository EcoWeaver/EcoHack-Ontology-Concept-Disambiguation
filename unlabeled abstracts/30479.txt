Distribution and ecology of Hemimysis anomala, the latest invader of the Great Lakes basin
Since 2006, the known distribution of Hemimysis anomala has greatly expanded in the Great Lakes ecosystem, with, to date, 45 sites of occurrence among 91 monitored sites, located in four of the Great Lakes and the upper St. Lawrence River. By means of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, a first assessment of the feeding ecology of Hemimysis was completed. The d13C values of 18 individuals collected in Lake Erie (Port Mainland) on a single date (Sept. 23, 2008) ranged from -30.2 to -24.5%0, indicating that Hemimysis could feed on multiple carbon sources including pelagic and littoral autochthonous and terrestrial carbon. In Lake Erie, variation in d13C was related to d15N, indicating the importance of food source for determining the trophic position of Hemimysis. The d15N signatures of individuals were strongly related to their C/N ratios, suggesting that variations in the nutritional value of Hemimysis may depend on trophic position. Isotopic variation among individuals in Lake Erie was complemented by temporal variation in Lake Ontario. Monthly changes (from June to December 2008) in carbon isotope signatures were observed and related to changes in water temperature, highlighting the variations in the baseline prey signatures that fuel Hemimysis diets. The observed variation in stable isotope signatures occurring among individuals within a localized Hemimysis assemblage and temporally should be considered as a key design feature in further studies attempting to identify the possible effects of Hemimysis on nearshore food webs in the Great Lakes.
