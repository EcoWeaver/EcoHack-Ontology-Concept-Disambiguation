Ecological effects and management aspects of an exotic tree species: the case of lodgepole pine in Sweden
The North American tree Pinus contorta var. latifolia was experimentally introduced in Sweden already in the 1920s, and has been used in Swedish forestry on a large scale since the 1970s. These plantations now cover 565,000 ha, mainly in the northern area.In this paper we summarize and discuss existing ecological knowledge of this species introduction. With regard to long-term sustainability we suggest management means to minimize harmful effects of the introduction on ecosystems. These include aspects of self dispersal, pests, ecosystem and landscape structures, and also ecological processes and biodiversity. We also focus on observed and possible interactions in the ecosystems. As Pinus contorta seeds are disseminated and trees regenerated outside initial plantations, this may have future bearings on biodiversity.We suggest a strategy which takes account of the uncertainty in predicting future ecological effects. The strategy includes areal restrictions and zones without Pinus contorta, but also to set up a monitoring program. Observations of adverse effects from the plantations would then give the possibility to adjust P. contorta management.
