Seasonal dynamics and reproductive phenology of ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in fragments of native forest in the Manawatu, North Island, New Zealand
Seasonal activity and reproductive phenology of six forest-inhabiting, common New Zealand endemic carabid beetles, Zolus cf. femoralis Broun, Holcaspis mucronata Broun, Megadromus capito (White), Megadromus turgidiceps (Broun), Plocamosthetus planiusculus (White), and Ctenognathus adamsi Broun, were studied by pitfall trapping, ageing, and dissecting of females. Beetles were collected from forest fragments in the Manawatu region, North Island, in 1990-92 and 1999-2000. Two distinct activity periods were distinguished, in the (austral) spring (August-September) and in late summer-autumn (January-April). Five species collected were reproductively active in both seasons, although no teneral beetles were found in spring. A sixth species, M. turgidiceps was active on the soil surface only in autumn. Results from ageing suggested that the larger species in the tribe Pterostichini lived longer than 1 year and could reproduce more than once
