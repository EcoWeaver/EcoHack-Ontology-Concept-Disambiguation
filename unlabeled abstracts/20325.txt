Water relations advantages for invasive Rubus armeniacus over two native ruderal congeners
Despite species in the Rubus fruticosus complex (wild blackberry) being among the most invasive plants globally in regions with large annual fluctuations in water availability, little is known about their water relations. We compared water relations of a prominent member of the complex, R. armeniacus (Himalayan blackberry), with species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America (PNW), R. spectabilis (salmonberry) and R. parviflorus (thimbleberry). In eight stands of each species located near Portland, Oregon, USA, we measured mid-day hydraulic resistance (R plant), and daily time series of stomatal conductance (g s), leaf water potential (Pslf), and environmental conditions at four time periods spanning the 2007 growing season. Although all species maintained Pslf above -0.5 MPa in spring, R. armeniacus maintained less negative Pslf (>=-1.0 MPa) than the natives in summer, a factor attributable to advantages in both its root and shoot systems. R plant of R. armeniacus was <=0.1 MPa mmol-1 m2 s for the duration of the study, and approximately 25-50% of R plant for the native species in summer. R. armeniacus had higher g s compared to the native species throughout the spring and summer, with approximately twice their rates in summer. Our R plant and g s results show that R. armeniacus has access to more water during PNW summers than congeneric natives, allowing it to maintain high water-use, and potentially helping it achieve higher growth and reproductive rates. Water relations may therefore be a critical component of the competitive and invasive success of R. armeniacus and other R. fruticosus species worldwide.
