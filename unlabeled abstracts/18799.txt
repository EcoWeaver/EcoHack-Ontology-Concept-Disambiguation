Can perennial dominant grass Miscanthus sinensis be nurse plant in recovery of degraded hilly land landscape in South China?
Perennial C4 grasses, especially Miscanthus sinensis, are widely distributed in the degraded lands in South China. We transplanted native and exotic tree seedlings under the canopy of M. sinensis to assess the interaction (competition or facilitation) between dominant grass M. sinensis and tree seedlings. The results of growth, chlorophyll fluorescence, and ultrastructure showed that negative effects may be stronger in perennial dominant grass M. sinensis. Although M. sinensis buffered the air temperature, improved soil structure, and increased soil phosphorus content, these beneficial effects were outweighed by the detrimental effect, especially overshading. To ensure the establishment of target native species in M. sinensis communities in degraded lands of South China, restoration strategies should include removing aboveground vegetation, planting target species seedlings in openings to reduce the effects of canopy shading, and/or selecting competition-tolerant target species. Also, seedlings of exotic species used in restoration engineering cannot be directly planted under the canopy of M. sinensis.
