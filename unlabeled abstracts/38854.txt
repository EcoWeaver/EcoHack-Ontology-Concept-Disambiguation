First report of the invasive red lionfish Pterois volitans (Linnaeus, 1758) (Scorpaenidae) on the coast of Tamaulipas, Mexico
This paper documents the spread of the non-native, invasive, red lionfish (Pterois volitans), to the coast of Tamaulipas, Mexico, a state without coral reefs. Six specimens were collected from a breakwater in the town of La Pesca, municipality of Soto la Marina, in October 2016. The specimens had an average total length of 157 mm and were immature individuals with empty stomachs. We hypothesize that the presence of this species is due to larval dispersal by currents of the Gulf of Mexico.
