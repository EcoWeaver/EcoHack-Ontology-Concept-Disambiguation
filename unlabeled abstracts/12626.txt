Utility of unmanned aerial vehicles for mapping invasive plant species: a case study on yellow flag iris (Iris pseudacorus L.)
This study investigates the utility of an off-the-shelf, consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for invasive species mapping in a lacustrine fringe environment. Specifically, this work sought to determine whether such a UAV would be capable of creating accurate maps of the extent of patches of an invasive plant, yellow flag iris (Iris pseudacorus L.), more efficiently than could be accomplished by a traditional field survey, which is often considered in the literature to provide the most accurate maps. The study was conducted at two lakes in the central interior of British Columbia. The UAV used in this study was a DJI Phantom 3 Professional that can acquire images using the built-in 12.4 MP digital camera. This UAV was selected because it is representative of the type of aerial platform that is easily accessible to invasive plant managers in terms of cost, ease of use, and lack of legal restrictions. Three methods of mapping the yellow flag iris were compared: (1) field survey, (2) manual interpretation of the raw UAV-acquired imagery and the orthoimage created from these data, and (3) pixel-based classification of the orthoimage created from the UAV imagery using a random forest classifier. The results revealed that, at both lakes considered, manual interpretation of the UAV-acquired imagery produced the most accurate maps of yellow flag iris infestation, with a false-positive and false-negative classification rate of less than 1%.
