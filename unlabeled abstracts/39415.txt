Performance of baited traps used as control tools for the invasive hornet Vespa velutina and their impact on non-target insects
The efficiency and selectiveness of baited traps to control the invasive hornet Vespa velutina is often questioned. Comparative assessments are needed to improve control plans and reduce the impact on honeybees and entomofauna. Our aims were to study the performance of traps and baits, to identify environmental conditions that affect capture rates and to identify the groups of insects affected by trapping. During spring in 2016, three types of trap and baits in a full factorial design were tested. Vespa velutina accounted for less than 1% of all captures, reflecting the low selectiveness of the method. The trap design and its location are decisive aspects to determine the capture rates of V. velutina queens. All trap-bait combinations captured a very high quantity of dipterans, native hymenopterans, and lepidopterans. High capture rates of insect groups which are not common prey of V. velutina reflect that the method constitutes an additional threat on native insects.
