Natural dispersal to sub-Antarctic Marion Island of two arthropod species
Distinguishing between species that are recent natural colonists, recent anthropogenic introductions, or previously unknown, but long-term resident native species, is a challenge for those who manage the conservation of the Antarctic region. Here, we report the discovery of two new arthropod species on sub-Antarctic Marion Island--Nabis capsiformis Germar (Heteroptera: Nabidae) and Tetragnatha sp. (Araneomorphae: Tetragnathidae). On the basis of their habitat use, dispersal abilities, historic biodiversity survey records, and limited information on genetic diversity, we conclude that the colonization events were natural.
