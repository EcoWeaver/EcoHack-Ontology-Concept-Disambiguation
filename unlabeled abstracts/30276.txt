Invasive Salix fragilis: altered metabolic patterns in Australian streams
Willows (Salix spp.) are listed as a weed of national significance in Australia. Despite this recognition, functional effects of willows on streams compared to native species are largely unknown . Leaves supply carbon to instream food webs, but may also act as surfaces for biofilm, and thus can contribute in different ways to stream metabolism. Salix fragilis L. and Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. leaves that had been colonised by biofilms were placed into chambers in laboratory conditions, and metabolic rates were measured. Gross Primary Production (GPP) of biofilms on E. camaldulensis leaves after 10 days of incubation were significantly greater than biofilms on S. fragilis leaves. S. fragilis leaves displayed greater rates of microbial decomposition per leaf mass. Autotrophic biomass was one hundred fold greater on E. camaldulensis leaves. The biofilm on E. camaldulensis leaves is likely to support a greater population of grazers, compared to S. fragilis. The alien S. fragilis leaves, therefore, are fuelling a different component of the food web to endemic E. camaldulensis leaves. Endemic Eucalyptus spp. leaves play an important role in temperate Australian streams as a substrate for autotrophic growth and provide a year round pathway for carbon to reach secondary invertebrate consumers.
