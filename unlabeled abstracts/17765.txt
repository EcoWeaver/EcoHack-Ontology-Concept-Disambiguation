The seasonal dynamics of potentially toxic and harmful phytoplankton species in Novorossiysk Bay (Black Sea)
The seasonal dynamics of the taxonomic composition and abundance of potentially toxic and harmful phytoplankton species in the Novorossiysk Bay in 2005-2007 was studied. The network of monitoring stations covered areas with different hydrological and hydrochemical parameters, as well as locations of the dumping of ship-ballast water, which are particularly susceptible to biological invasion. In all, 19 species of potentially toxic and harmful algae were recorded; their abundance reached 3 million cells/L. These were mostly diatoms (Pseudo-nitzschia) and dinophytes (Prorocentrum, Dinophysis, Scrippsiella, and Ceratium), whose abundant development (262 thousand and 8.8 thousand cells/L, respectively) was annually recorded in April-August. From September to March, the abundance of representatives of these divisions averaged no more than 6 and 2.7 thousand cells/L, respectively. An outbreak of the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis pouchetii (38 thousand cells/L) in the port area was observed from April to August, 2006.
