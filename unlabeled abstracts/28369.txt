Foliage Feeding Invasive Insects: Defoliators and Gall Makers
In this chapter we concentrate on the main invasive species which feed on the foliage, by consuming leaves or inducing galls, and which affect both native and non-native tree species. We provide details on their biology, invasion routes, host tree species, damage to native and non-native trees and control strategies.
