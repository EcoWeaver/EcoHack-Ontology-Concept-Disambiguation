Correction for Armstrong and Ball, DNA barcodes for biosecurity: invasive species identification
Correction for 'DNA barcodes for biosecurity: invasive species identification' by K. F. Armstrong and S. L. Ball (Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 360 , 1813-1823. (doi: [10.1098/rstb.2005.1713][1])). On page 1819, the final sentence of the paragraph ending four lines from the bottom of the right-hand column was incorrect, and should read as follows: For example, it was possible to place specimens previously identified as ' B. dorsalis complex' with reasonable bootstrap support and minimal sequence divergence (see figure 2 in the Electronic Appendix) to a likely species, B. caryeae .
