Management options of invasive Elodea nuttallii and Elodea canadensis
Elodea nuttallii and Elodea canadensis, two invasive submerged and rooted aquatic macrophyte species, are receiving increasing attention for their rapid and lasting invasion of many freshwater habitats throughout Europe, Asia and Australia. This review summarizes the present scientific knowledge about means of controlling Elodea nuttallii and Elodea canadensis within of aquatic weed management programs. Both species exhibit high growth rates with a high tolerance to wide ranges of environmental conditions, low vulnerability to grazing and other stress factors, high distribution and reproduction potential, and relatively high resistance to common conventional aquatic weed management procedures. Possibilities for the further use of harvested Elodea biomass are presented and novel approaches to the improvement of the monitoring and management of Elodea plagues are discussed.
