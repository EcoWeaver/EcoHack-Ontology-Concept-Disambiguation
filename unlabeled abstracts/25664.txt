Deconstructing a controversial local range expansion: conservation biogeography of the painted reed frog (Hyperolius marmoratus) in South Africa
ABSTRACT Local range expansions might either be the response of populations to climate or landscape change, or be caused directly by human intervention. In the latter case the expansion would be considered the first in the steps leading to a biological invasion. In species typically not the subject of human commerce, distinguishing the causes of local range expansions is problematic. Range dynamic theory provides a basis for doing so, and, when used to assess phylogeographical information, can be a powerful conservation biogeographical approach. Here we adopt this approach to resolve the controversial case of the recent range expansion of the painted reed frog (Hyperolius marmoratus) in southern South Africa. Within the last decade, H. marmoratus has spread westward approximately 500 km from its historical range. This local range expansion could either represent human-mediated jump dispersal, or a response to landscape or climate change. To date, the latter has been assumed, although not universally. Using a phylogeographic approach to investigate these competing hypotheses, a portion of the mitochondrial COI gene was sequenced for individuals from within the historical range (n = 178), and four putatively introduced populations in dams (n = 121). There was substantial geographical population structure within the historical range, and these populations were significantly different from the dam populations (ST = 0.817, P Keywords: Anura; biological invasions; climate change; landscape change; leading edge effect; samova Document Type: Research Article DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00428.x Affiliations: Centre for Invasion Biology, Department of Botany and Zoology, Stellenbosch University, Private Bag X1, Matieland 7602, South Africa Publication date: March 1, 2008 $(document).ready(function() { var shortdescription = $(".originaldescription").text().replace(/\\&/g, '&').replace(/\\, '<').replace(/\\>/g, '>').replace(/\\t/g, ' ').replace(/\\n/g, ''); if (shortdescription.length > 350){ shortdescription = "" + shortdescription.substring(0,250) + "... more"; } $(".descriptionitem").prepend(shortdescription); $(".shortdescription a").click(function() { $(".shortdescription").hide(); $(".originaldescription").slideDown(); return false; }); }); Related content In this: publication By this: publisher In this Subject: Biology , Ecology By this author: Tolley, Krystal A. ; Davies, Sarah J. ; Chown, Steven L.
