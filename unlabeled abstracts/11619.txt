Polistes dominulus (Hymenoptera, Vespidae) invading North America: some hypotheses for its rapid spread
Summary: Polistes dominulus, a common Polistes species with Old World distribution, is now invading the United States. We discuss those characteristics of P. dominulus that may explain its successful establishment in its new American environment. A versatile diet, the ability to colonize new environments and a short development time of the immature brood might have played an important role in the rapid spread in P. dominulus.
