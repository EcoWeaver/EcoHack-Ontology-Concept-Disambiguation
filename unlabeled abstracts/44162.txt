Silver nanoparticles intensify the allelopathic intensity of four invasive plant species in the Asteraceae
This study aimed to estimate the allelopathic intensity of four Asteraceae invasive plant species (IPS), including Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronq., Erigeron annuus (L.) Pers., Bidens pilosa (L.), and Aster subulatus Michx., by testing the effect of leaf extracts on the seed germination and seedling growth (SGe and SGr) of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in combination with two particle sizes of silver nanoparticles. These four IPS decreased the germination of lettuce seeds but increased the growth of lettuce seedlings. The allelopathic intensity of the four IPS decreased in the following order: B. pilosa > C. canadensis > E. annuus > A. subulatus. Silver nanoparticles decreased the SGe and SGr of lettuce. The 20 nm silver nanoparticles affected the competition intensity for water and the absorption of inorganic salts by lettuce more intensively than the 80 nm nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles intensify the allelopathic intensity of the four invasive plant species on the SGe and SGr of lettuce. The allelopathic intensity of B. pilosa was higher than that of the other three IPS when they were polluted with silver nanoparticles. Thus, silver nanoparticles could facilitate the invasion process of the four IPS, particularly B. pilosa, via an increase in the intensity of allelopathy.
