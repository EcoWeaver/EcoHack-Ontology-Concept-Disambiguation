The native hyperparasitoid complex of the invasive aphid parasitoid Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) in Benin, West Africa
A 2-year study in a vegetable-growing area (Tori, Hla Avame) in Benin has shown that the invasive aphid parasitoid Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Cresson) was attacked by three species of native hyperparasitoids. On several occasions, hyperparasitoids emerged from more than 90% of the mummies collected. The dominating hyperparasitoid was Syrphophagus africanus (Gahan). Two species in the genera Pachyneuron (Pteromalidae) and Aphanogmus (Ceraphronidae), respectively, were also recorded as hyperparasitoids. Charipinae hyperparasitoids were lacking. The only aphid host present at Hla Avame was Aphis gossypii Glover, a dominating species in vegetable agroecosystems in Benin.
