Control of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) in a firmly established area in Spain: risk factors and people's involvement
The tiger mosquito is a competent vector of dengue and chikungunya in Europe. Therefore, evaluating control strategies is a priority. In this work we aimed to determine the key factors affecting Aedes albopictus production, the preferred larval habitats, and we explored the involvement of the citizens in Sant Cugat, Spain. A source-reduction campaign including door-to-door visits and interviews to local inhabitants (2008-2010) and larval surveys (2010) was carried out. Civil workers inspected 3720 premises and interviewed 820 local inhabitants. Larval habitats, detected in 7.2% of the premises (n=266), were negatively associated with primary residence OR=0.4 (95% CI 0.3-0.6); and positively associated with schools OR=2.4 (95% CI 1.1-5.0), solid waste OR=5.1 (95% CI 3.0-8.9), scuppers OR=5.0 (95% CI 3.5-7.3) among other variables. Preventive measures were taken by 83.2% of householders (n=682). In 2010, 10.3% more citizens claimed to avoid having stagnant water compared with 2008. Simultaneously another 10.3% stopped using insecticides. Solid waste, scuppers and vegetable gardens were found to be important factors characterizing premises with larval habitats. People claimed to know about this insect and they considered it to be an important issue that diminished their quality of life.
