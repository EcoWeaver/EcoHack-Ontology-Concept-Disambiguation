Edge effects on vegetation and soils in a Virginia old-field
We investigated the effect of proximity to forest edge on plant community structure and ecosystem properties during succession, using field measurements of leaf area index (LAI), species composition, and soil carbon. Data were collected along four transects within a 14-year-old temperate successional field in north-central Virginia over the 2000 growing season. Additionally, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated from LANDSAT 7 satellite data at a resolution of 30 m for the entire field. Results showed that relative frequencies of trees increased with proximity to forest edge suggesting a more advanced stage of succession in areas close to the adjacent secondary forest. Significant negative relationships were observed between distance from forest edge and both peak season LAI and NDVI. LAI and NDVI values within 60 m of the forest edge, however, were not significantly different from those values in the adjacent mature secondary forest, suggesting that some community level properties may take relatively short periods of time to reach undisturbed states. The presence of several key plant species, particularly Celastrus scandens (climbing bittersweet), exhibited a strong control on the spatial variability of LAI and potentially the aboveground net primary production. Soil carbon levels did not show a significant increase at sites close to the adjacent secondary forest (relative to an adjacent crop field), as seen with LAI and NDVI, suggesting no recovery of soil carbon in these systems after 14years. This study points to the complexity of factors that influence spatial patterns of succession in old-fields and suggests that invasive species may play an important role in successional pathways and carbon cycling.
