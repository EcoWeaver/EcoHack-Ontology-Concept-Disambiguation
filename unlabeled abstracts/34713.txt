Recurrent bridgehead effects accelerate global alien ant spread
Significance Because of the globalization of trade and travel, worldwide invasion rates are high. A potential driver of the global acceleration of new invasions is the so-called bridgehead effect, in which initial invasive populations serve as the source of additional invasions via secondary introductions. However, the frequency and overall importance of secondary introductions remain largely unknown. Using a remarkable dataset, spanning nearly 100 years (1914-2013), of ant interceptions at air and maritime ports in the United States and New Zealand, we found that most ant introductions arise via secondary transport via intermediate regions. Our analyses also reveal positive feedback between the introduction and establishment stages of the invasion process via secondary introductions acting as a critical driver of increasing global invasion rates.
