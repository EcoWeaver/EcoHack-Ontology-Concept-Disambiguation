Phymatolithon lamii (Hapalidiaceae, Corallinales, Rhodophyta): a first report for the Mediterranean Sea
Abstract Phymatolithon lamii (Hapalidiaceae, Corallinales, Rhodophyta) is reported for the first time in the Mediterranean Sea. A morphological-anatomical account of Gulf of Trieste specimens is presented along with comparisons with P. lamii specimens from other regions, comparisons with other Mediterranean species of Phymatolithon and a dichotomous key to known Mediterranean species of Phymatolithon. Whether P. lamii occurs naturally in the Mediterranean Sea but was previously misidentified as P. lenormandii or is, alternatively, an alien species, or both, has not been resolved.
