Eradications as scientific experiments: progress in simultaneous eradications of two major invasive taxa from a Mediterranean island
Background Black rats Rattus rattus and mat-forming iceplants, Carpobrotus aff. acinaciformis and Carpobrotus edulis are pervasive pests on Mediterranean islands. Their cumulative impacts on native biotas alter the functioning of island ecosystems and threaten biodiversity. We report here the first attempt to eradicate both taxa from a protected nature reserve in south-eastern France (Bagaud Island). In order to minimize unwanted hazardous outcomes and produce scientific knowledge, the operations were embedded in a four-step strategy including initial site assessment, planning, restoration and monitoring.ResultsTrapping, which yielded to the removal of 1 923 rats in 21 045 trap-nights, allowed removing a substantial proportion of the resident rat population and reducing the amount of rodenticide delivered in the second stage of the operation. Forty tons of Carpobrotus spp. were manually up-rooted from of a total area of 18 000 m2; yet careful monitoring over a decade is still required to prevent germinations from the seed bank.Conclusion Two years after the beginning of the interventions, both eradication operations are still ongoing. Biosecurity measures have been implemented to reduce reinvasion risks of both taxa. With the long-term monitoring of various native plants and animals, Bagaud Island will become a reference study site for scientific purposes.
