Improving amphibian genomic resources: a multi-tissue reference transcriptome of an iconic invader.
Background Cane toads (Rhinella marina) are an iconic invasive species introduced to four continents and well utilized for studies of rapid evolution in introduced environments. Despite the long introduction history of this species, its profound ecological impacts and its utility for demonstrating evolutionary principles, genetic information is sparse. Here we produce a de novo transcriptome spanning multiple tissues and life stages to enable investigation of the genetic basis of previously identified rapid phenotypic change over the introduced range. Findings Using approximately 1.9 billion reads, from developing tadpoles and 6 adult tissue-specific cDNA libraries, and a transcriptome assembly pipeline encompassing 100 separate de novo assemblies, we constructed 62,202 transcripts, of which we functionally annotated ~50%. Our transcriptome assembly exhibits 90% full-length completeness of the BUSCO (benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs) dataset. Robust assembly metrics and comparisons to several available anuran transcriptomes and genomes indicate that our cane toad assembly is one of the most complete anuran genomic resources available. Conclusion This comprehensive anuran transcriptome will provide a valuable resource for investigation of genes under selection during invasion in cane toads, but will also greatly expand our general knowledge of anuran genomes, which are underrepresented in the literature. The dataset is publically available in NCBI and GigaDB to serve as a resource for other researchers.
