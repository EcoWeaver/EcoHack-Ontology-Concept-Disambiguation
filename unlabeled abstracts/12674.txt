An Update to the Adventive Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphidoidea) of America North of Mexico, with Notes on Intercepted Species
Two hundred and sixty-two adventive aphids (Hemiptera: Aphidoidea) have been previously reported in North America north of Mexico. We update this to include 25 previously unrecorded species, and include information on the location and date of first discovery, biogeographic origin, and economically important North American hosts for these species. The number of adventive species introduced per year has decreased overall since 1930.We discuss aphids intercepted at United States ports of entry and identified by the Systematic Entomology Laboratory from 2000-2016 and comment on how the composition of species intercepted may affect the adventive species that become established.
