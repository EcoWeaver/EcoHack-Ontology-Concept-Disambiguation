Seasonal Development of an Invasive Exotic Species,Contarinia nasturtii(Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), in Quebec
The seasonal development of the swede midge Contarinia nasturtii Kieffer was studied in Quebec in 2004 and 2005 using pheromone traps, emergence cages, and visual inspection in relation to degree-day accumulations (DD7.2 degrees C). Peak emergence of overwintering adults occurred between 344 and 731 DD7.2 degrees C (second half of June) during both seasons. The swede midge had three to four overlapping generations in Quebec based on adult captures in pheromone traps and abundance of larvae in the field. The level of infestation was higher in late transplants than in early transplants, with cauliflower and broccoli being more susceptible to damage than white or red cabbage under high pest population.
