Managing marine invasive species through public participation: Lionfish derbies as a case study
The management of invasive species can be facilitated by public participation. The drivers of public involvement and success at invasive removal in tournaments (derbies) to catch Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) in the Western Atlantic were examined. Information on 69 lionfish derbies held in the wider Caribbean region from 2010 - 2015 was compiled. Derbies attended mainly by artisanal fishers reported lower catches but higher participation than derbies dominated by recreational divers or attended by a mixed public. As predicted, the number of lionfish caught increased with effort and with time since lionfish were established in an area. In contrast, participation was best predicated by national wealth (GDP per capita) and number of local dive shops. From the point of view of public engagement, derbies should therefore be held in areas where lionfish are well established, and where the pool of potential participants is large. However, if the management goal is instead to slow the invasion, early detection is critical. The focus should then shift to areas where no or very few lionfish have been detected, and the derby approach modified to a more frequent or continuous, monitoring-like incentive scheme.
