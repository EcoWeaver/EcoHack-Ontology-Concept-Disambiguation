First report of the Q biotype ofBemisia tabaci in Japan by mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequence analysis
The recent upsurgence ofBemisia tabaci (Genn.) as an important insect pest and vector ofTomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is directly linked to serious damage to tomato crops grown throughout Japan. The molecular genetic identification and phylogenetic relationships of 12B. tabaci populations collected from representative locations in Japan were determined based on the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) sequence. Phylogenetic analysis of the whitefly mtCOI sequence indicated that both the invasive B and Q biotypes now occur in Japan. The Q biotype was found at four locations: Mihara in Hiroshima, Nishigoshi in Kumamoto, Miyanojo and Okuchi in Kagoshima prefectures; the remaining eight collections were identified as the B biotype. This is the first report of the introduction of Q biotype in Japan.
