A review of the alien and expansive species of freshwater cyanobacteria and algae in the Czech Republic
The invasion and spread of non-native species of many different kinds of organisms is of increasing interest to researchers. Invasions by microscopic organisms, however, are poorly understood, and their impact on the environment is probably underestimated. We collected available data on non-native and invasive/expansive algae and cyanobacteria in the Czech Republic; we mapped their distribution and assessed their impact on local species and other real or potential risks resulting from their spread. The list of alien species in the Czech Republic contains 10 species of cyanobacteria, 9 species of Bacillariophyceae, 1 species of Dinophyta, 1 species of Ulvophyceae, 2 species of Chlorophyceae, and 1 species complex of Zygnematopyceae. The literature on the worldwide occurrence of these taxa is also reviewed. KeywordsAlien species-Invasive species-Expansive species-Cyanobacteria-Algae-Freshwater-Czech Republic
