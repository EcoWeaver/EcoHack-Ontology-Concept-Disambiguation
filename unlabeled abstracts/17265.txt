Fish assemblages respond to altered flow regimes via ecological filtering of life history strategies
1. In riverine ecosystems, streamflow determines the physical template upon which the life history strategies of biota are forged. Human freshwater needs and activities have resulted in widespread alteration of the variability, predictability and timing of streamflow, and anticipating the biotic consequences of anthropogenic streamflow alteration is critical for successful environmental flow management. In this study, we examined relationships between dam characteristics, metrics of flow alteration and fish functional community composition according to life history strategies by coupling stream flow records and fish survey data in paired flow-regulated and free-flowing rivers across the conterminous United States.
