Biological observations for invasive alien insect species Anoplophora chinensis (Forster, 1771)
In recent years, invasive and exotic insect species have been frequently found in Turkey. Anoplophora chinensis (Forster, 1771) was first recorded in Sile (Istanbul province) county, Turkey, in June 2014 and later in Zeytinburnu (the garden of the Abdi Ipekci Sports Complex and the surrounding) in July in the same year. This study was conducted in these two counties in particular between June 2014 and July 2016 with the aims of making remarks on an earlier misidentification of Anoplophora species and determining the life cycle and the host plants in Istanbul, Turkey. It was noted that the record of A. glabripennis in Istanbul was a misidentification of A. chinensis. It took 1 year to complete its generation. The primary host plant of this insect was found to be Acer negundo.
