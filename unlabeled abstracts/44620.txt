Findings of invasive and potentially invasive plant species in the Western regions of the Republic of Bashkortostan
Invasions of aggressive alien plant species that have a high rate of expansion and pose a threat to ecosystems and their biodiversity have become more active in the 21st century due to anthropogenic disturbances of vegetation cover, the lack of systematic control of their numbers, the expansion of transport corridors, etc. Research for the search of new locations of adventitious plant species is carried out in the Republic of Bashkortostan especially intensively during the last 10 years. The result of this work was the publication of the "blacklist" flora of Bashkortostan [1] including 100 invasive and potentially invasive plants and "Synopsis of adventive species of the Republic of Bashkortostan" [13], who presented data on 457 localities of alien plant species, is not peculiar to the nature of Bashkortostan. This article is an addition to the previously published data obtained during the route expedition research in 2019-2020, conducted in the Western regions of the Republic. More than 150 new localities of 22 invasive and potentially invasive plant species were identified. 11 species are included in the "Black book of flora of Central Russia" [9]. The data obtained clarify and expand the understanding of the modern secondary range of invasive plants on the territory of the Republic.
