First record of the invasive Ponto-Caspian tubenose goby Proterorhinus marmoratus (Pallas, 1814) from the River Pripyat, Belarus
The invasive Ponto-Caspian gobiid fish Proterorhinus marmoratus has been recorded in August 2007 for the first time in the upper and middle sections of the River Pripyat (Republic of Belarus), a principal invasion corridor of European inland waters. This species was found mainly in river oxbows characterized by depths of 0.3-1.0 m, aquatic vegetation and muddy substrata. Tubenose goby invasion of the River Pripyat basin was via reservoirs on the River Dnieper, which was invaded by the species during the late-1970s.
