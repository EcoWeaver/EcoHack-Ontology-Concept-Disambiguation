Ruppell's weaver, Ploceus galbula Ruppell, 1880 invasion of the Eastern Arabian Peninsula: potential economic and social impacts
In this article we report the first invasion of Ruppell's weaver (Ploceus galbula) into the Palearctic biogeographic zone. This research documents the introduction and spread of Ruppell's weaver in the Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. Because the Ruppell's weaver are not strong fliers, their introduction is almost certainly caused by escapees and deliberate releases of birds brought in by pet trade. Subsequently, Ruppell's weavers were able to breed and spread, feeding on the seasonal crops, while exhibiting the ability to utilize variable food sources. After the first introduction in Al-Qatif city, the weavers spread north and south. This report highlights the potential ecological, economic and social impacts of the weaver's invasion in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Lastly, the importance of a comprehensive study assessing the effects the Ruppell's weaver has in these invaded habitats is highlighted.
