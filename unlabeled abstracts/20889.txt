Changes in segetal vegetation in the Borska nizina Lowland (Slovakia) over 50 years
This article reports changes in the segetal vegetation in the Borska nizina Lowland (Western Slovakia) over 50 years. The study was based on phytosociological releves obtained by Krippelova in the years 1949-1955, as well as our own recent data from the years 2002-2006. Using ordination and statistical methods, structural and floristic changes to four associations recorded in the area in both time periods were evaluated: Veronicetum trilobae-triphyllidi, Consolido-Anthemidetum austriacae, Echinochloo-Setarietum pumilae and Setario viridis-Erigeronetum canadensis. These plant communities are found in arable fields or young fallows. In some of these communities the proportion of invasive species, as well as archaeophytes and native species, has increased. Some agricultural practices (like fertilization and liming) support the spread of nitrophilous and calcareous species. Several ruderal species and herbicide-resistant species have expanded in the fields. In all studied associations the proportion of nutrient-demanding species has increased. Some rare and threatened species have declined or disappeared, but some threatened species that are missing from historical material are now present. However, the changes detected are not as substantial as expected based on data from other countries. Key wordsEllenberg's indicator values-immigration status-invasive status-life forms-threat
