Invasions of rainbow trout and brown trout in Japan: A comparison of invasiveness and impact on native species
Many species of salmonids have been stocked into waters outside of their native range. The invasiveness and impact of these species on native species varies depending on their biological traits, and on environmental conditions, such as climate. In Japan, rainbow trout and brown trout, both listed in 100 of the world's worst invasive alien species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, occur as non-native species. The invasiveness of these two species is thought to be related to seasonal flooding, given flood waters can physically damage fry and prevent population establishment. Rainbow trout have successfully invaded waters in Hokkaido, northern Japan, where the likelihood of flooding is low between June and July, when their fry emerge, but successful invasions are rare in regions south of Hokkaido. Brown trout, however, have successfully invaded waters not only in Hokkaido, but also other regions. Since brown trout have a similar life history to the native white-spotted charr and masu salmon, with fry emerging before the flood season, they are more suited to the Japanese climate than Rainbow trout. Rainbow and brown trout interact with native species in various ways, but a common outcome of these interactions is the displacement of native charr species. Legal regulations of non-native salmonids should be based on understandings of the ecological traits of each invasive species and regional impacts on native species. Given the ongoing nature of climate change, the nature and extent of the effects of rainbow and brown trout on native species might also change.
