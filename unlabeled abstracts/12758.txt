First record of the invasive pest Drosophila suzukii in Ukraine indicates multiple sources of invasion
Drosophila suzukii, commonly known as the spotted-wing Drosophila, is an invasive polyphagous fruit pest, which has emerged as a global threat to agriculture in the Americas and in Europe. Due to the rapid spread, great economic losses and its pest behavior, D. suzukii represents a powerful model for invasion biology and pest management studies. However, its current European distribution, invasion routes and levels of genetic diversity in populations of D. suzukii are poorly understood. We present the first report of D. suzukii from Ukraine, with the invasion likely occurring close to 2014. The pattern of genetic variation at cytochrome oxidase I among D. suzukii populations from Europe, USA and Asia reveals comparatively high genetic diversity in the Ukrainian population of this pest species, suggesting a complex invasion scenario from multiple sources. Further monitoring patterns of genetic variation across space and time, to better understand the invasion routes of this invasive insect pest, will be an essential part for developing successful pest management strategies.
