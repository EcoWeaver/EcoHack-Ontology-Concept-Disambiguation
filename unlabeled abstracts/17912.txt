Changes in Relative Abundance of Several Minnesota Fishes from 1970 to 2013
Large-scale ecological stressors such as climate change, habitat degradation, and invasive species increasingly affect fisheries across watershed or political boundaries within which they are typically managed. Though broad-scale analyses of trends in fish populations and changes in aquatic communities can be useful for detecting the effects of these stressors, they are rarely possible due to a lack of long-term data sets. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has used gill nets and trap nets to monitor fish communities in lakes since 1940, and the techniques have been standardized since 1970. We applied a random-coefficient mixed-effects model to mean CPUE data to describe statewide and local population trends of eight key fish species (Black Crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, Northern Pike Esox lucius, Smallmouth Bass M. dolomieu, Walleye Sander vitreus, White Sucker Catostomus commersonii, and Yellow Perch Perca flavescens) sampled from 1970 to 2013 in 119-1,499 lakes. We found increasing statewide trends in gill-net CPUE of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye and decreasing trends for Yellow Perch and White Sucker. Statewide trends in average trap-net CPUE were positive for Bluegill, negative for Black Crappie, Walleye, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch, and stable for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Smallmouth Bass. We compared the CPUE trends across lake types developed for Minnesota lakes and found some differences, especially in medium and large mesotrophic lakes, suggesting that some species display changes in abundance more in those lakes types than in others. This study quantifies temporal changes in Minnesota's fish community structure and can help managers focus future research and management activities in the state and in similar waters across central North America.Received May 14, 2014; accepted September 9, 2014
