<i>Spartina alterniflora</i>Invasion Alters Carbon Exchange and Soil Organic Carbon in Eastern Salt Marsh of China
We investigated carbon (C) fluxes from Spartina alterniflora community comparing with native C3-plant (Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis) communities as well as mudflat in a coastal marsh in eastern China by determining the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R ECO) and soil respiration (R SOIL) monthly with static chambers over 1 year. Plant biological traits and soil organic carbon (SOC) were measured at the end of the growing season. Gross primary production (GPP) was calculated as the sum of R ECO and NEE, while the respiration of aboveground plant (R AG) was assessed by the difference between R ECO and R SOIL. The invasion of S. alterniflora significantly increased R ECO, GPP, and R AG in salt marsh. The NEE in the S. alterniflora community was significantly lower than in mudflat and S. salsa community (p < 0.05), but was comparable to that in P. australis community (p > 0.05). R SOIL among sites with different communities did not show significant variations (p > 0.05). Surface water inhibited R SOIL and made it insensitive to changes in environmental factors across communities. Relative to other communities, the lower shoot-root ratio of S. alterniflora community together with its higher R ECO and R AG determined a higher proportion of C allocated in belowground, which ultimately resulted in increment of SOC as well as increased GPP. The invasion of S. alterniflora potentially induces a negative feedback to the global climate change by regulating the C sequestration in salt marsh ecosystems.
