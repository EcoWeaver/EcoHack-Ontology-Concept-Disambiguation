The COVID-19 Restrictions and Biological Invasion: A Global Terrestrial Ecosystem Perspective on Propagule Pressure and Invasion Trajectory
Biological invasions driven by climate change, transportation, and intercontinental trade, as well as land-use change and tourism, pose severe threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services worldwide. However, the COVID-19-induced shutdowns and cross-border restrictions could have significantly impacted some of these drivers. Thus, COVID-19-induced restrictions may potentially alter the invasion trajectories and propagule pressure of invasive alien species, yet very few studies have examined this possibility. Here, we provide a unique conceptual framework to examine how COVID-19-induced restrictions may influence the rate, magnitude, and trajectories of biological invasions. We also discuss the similarities between the high-hit regions of COVID-19 and the global hotspot of biological invasions. Additionally, we assessed whether previous predictions of biological invasions still hold despite the strong impact of COVID-19 on the drivers of invasions. Finally, we emphasize the possibility of harnessing such restrictive measures to manage invasive species, nature reserves, and national parks. The present study is a significant addition to the current understanding of the interplay between pandemic outbreaks and biological invasions in the context of both direct and indirect effects of global ecosystem change.
