What guides invasion success? Ecological correlates of arrival, establishment and spread of Red Sea bivalves in the Mediterranean Sea
AimThe opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 re-established the direct link between long-separated biogeographic realms, allowing hundreds of marine species to spread from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. We use marine bivalves to relate species-level attributes to successful transition through successive stages of the invasion process.LocationMediterranean and Red Sea.Methods We compiled data on taxonomic composition, body size, life habit and geographic distribution of the Red Sea bivalve fauna from published literature, museum collections and our own field surveys. Using multimodel inference, we examined selectivity of the Lessepsian invasion and identify traits that distinguish successful species at three major stages of invasion: arrival, establishment and spread.ResultsThe upper limit of bathymetric range and occurrence outside the tropical zone in other regions are the strongest predictors of successful transition through the Suez Canal. Establishment in the Mediterranean is positively correlated with earlier arrival and association with hard-bottom habitats. Preference for hard substrates together with large body size is the primary factor distinguishing invasive aliens representing a significant threat to recipient ecosystems from other established species.Main conclusionsThe relative strength of abiotic and biotic filters changes along the course of the invasion: environmental affinity and climate match constrain the pool of potential invaders, while the establishment in the new region and invasive status depend on the habitat preferences and life history traits of aliens, affecting their interactions with resident species. Our results together with previous studies suggest that the eastern Mediterranean rocky shores are more susceptible to the establishment of Lessepsian species, many of which may induce strong pressure on recipient communities as ecosystems engineers and competitors of native species.
