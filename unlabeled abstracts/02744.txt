Phytochemical study of Caulerpa racemosa (Forsk.) J. Agarth, an invading alga in the habitat of La Maddalena Archipelago
Caulerpa racemosa is a marine Chlorophyta widely distributed in tropical areas, introduced into the Mediterranean Sea since 1990. It has been invading the Mediterranean Sea causing ecological problems. This invasive event can be considered as one of the most serious in the history of species introduced into the Mediterranean Sea, even if C. racemosa has not triggered as much attention as the famous 'killer alga' Caulerpa taxifolia. The aim of this work is to analyse phytochemically C. racemosa in the northern Sardinia area for secondary metabolites. Marine algae shows the molecular pattern of bis-indole alkaloids, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and sterols. The intention is to expand phytochemical analysis in order to understand just how significant the anti-tumour, anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive actions can be.
