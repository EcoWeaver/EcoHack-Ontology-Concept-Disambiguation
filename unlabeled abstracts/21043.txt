The brown trout (Salmo trutta) in the lake, Ovre Heimdalsvatn: long-term changes in population dynamics due to exploitation and the invasive species, European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus)
Studies of the brown trout (Salmo trutta) population in the Norwegian subalpine lake, Ovre Heimdalsvatn, over a 50-year period have revealed major changes in population dynamics. In 1958, the population density was high, with individuals stagnating in growth at lengths below 30cm. After heavy exploitation during the years 1958-1969, the number of older fish declined substantially, and growth rates increased significantly. Since 1969, the European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) have been observed in the lake, with increasing densities from 1977-1978 to 1999-2000. The age structure of the brown trout population has changed markedly from the 1960s to the period 1993-2006. Annual recruitment significantly declined, from an average number of 3746 individuals in age-class 4 during the period 1958-1966 to an average of 1668 during the period 1993-2006. However, due to lower exploitation rates, the number of old fish was significantly higher in the latter period. The summer diet of brown trout has changed substantially from a dominance of the large crustaceans Lepidurus arcticus and Gammarus lacustris to a high occurrence of European minnows, while L. arcticus has become practically absent from the diet. There was a negative relationship between brown trout biomass and annual length increment. However, despite a brown trout biomass at the same level during the years 1993-2006 as in the 1960s, annual individual growth rates have significantly declined. The reduced recruitment and reduced annual growth rates of the brown trout, as well as changes in the diet, are most likely related to the introduction and establishment of the invasive species, the European minnow.
