Three non-indigenous species from Madeira harbors, including a new species of Parasmittina (Bryozoa)
During a study investigating the identity and abundance of fouling non-indigenous species in marinas from the Madeira Archipelago, three species of bryozoans were detected on experimental settlement plates. These three species are described and figured. Celleporaria inaudita was previously only known from Vanuatu (South Pacific Ocean) and Safaga Bay (Red Sea). Parasmittina alba was previously only known from the Brazilian coast. The origin of Parasmitina multiaviculata sp. nov. is unknown. Secondary introduction by anthropogenic vectors (via hull fouling of recreational vessels) seems the most plausible explanation for the presence of these species in the Madeira Islands.
