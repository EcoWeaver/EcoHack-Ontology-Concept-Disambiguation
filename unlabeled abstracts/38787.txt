The exotic sap beetle Phenolia (Lasiodites) picta (Macleay, 1825) is recorded for the first time in Greece. In August 2018, a nitidulid beetle was found near Mt. Pelion of Central Greece. It was later identified as P. picta, a recent alien species in Europe, previously recorded from Spain, France, and Turkey.
