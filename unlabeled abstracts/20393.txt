Seasonal home range estimates and habitat selection of saugeye in a small warmwater impoundment
Abstract Saugeye, a hatchery-produced hybrid of walleye, Sander vitreus (Mitchill), x sauger, Sander canadense (Griffith & Smith), is commonly stocked by several state fishery management agencies in the United States. Saugeye is a top-level predator that can restructure fish communities and provide supplemental angling opportunities. However, there are few published studies explaining distributions and habitat selection of saugeye. This study determined seasonal home range estimates and habitat selection of saugeye in a small warmwater impoundment using ultrasonic telemetry. Seasons for this study were defined as winter, spawn, spring, summer and autumn. Mean home range estimates were greatest during spawn when water temperature increased from 7.5 to 15 degC and lowest in winter when water temperature decreased below 7.5 degC. Saugeye selected open water and mid-water ledge habitat during each season, but rock/gravel shoreline was increasingly selected during winter and spawn. These results corroborate previous studies that suggest saugeye exhibit seasonal variation in distribution and habitat use patterns. Managers should consider distribution and habitat selection trends of saugeye when assessing stocks or determining whether to introduce the species in a small warmwater impoundment.
