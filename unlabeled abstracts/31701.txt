New record of the invasive snail Melanoides tuberculata (Gastropoda, Thiaridae) - Ceara State, Brazil
Abstract Melanoides tuberculata is a freshwater gastropod native to Africa and Asia, and currently presents distributed worldwide. The first record of Melanoides tuberculata in South America occurred in Brazil, in the city of Santos, state of Sao Paulo, in 1967. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to report the occurrence of Melanoides tuberculata for Banana Lagoon and to characterize the current population situation. The gastropods were collected through direct visualization of shells, morphometric measurements of Melanoides tuberculata shells were determined using a digital caliper. After identifying the gastropod and its first distribution in the area, a preliminary descriptive analysis of the population was carried out. The gastropods were classified by grouping the individuals into four classes according to the shell width (mm). This is the first record of the occurrence of Melanoides tuberculata, in Banana Lagoon, Caucaia municipality, Ceara state, Northeast Brazil, being the largest specimen cited in the literature (33.77 mm) and 92.65% of the gastropods present in sizes above the first reproduction stages.
