Interception frequency of exotic bark and ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytinae) and relationship with establishment in New Zealand and worldwide
Scolytinae species are among the most damaging forest pests, and many of them are invasive. Over 1500 Scolytinae interceptions were recorded at New Zealand's borders between,1950 and 2000. Among,the 103 species were Dendroctonus ponderosae, Ips typographus, and other high-risk species, but actual arrivals probably included many more species. Interceptions were primarily associated with dunnage, casewood (crating), and sawn timber, and originated from 59 countries, mainly from Europe, Australasia, northern Asia, and North America. New Zealand and United States in- terception data were highly correlated, and 7 of the 10 most intercepted species were shared. Interception frequency and establishment,in New Zealand were not clearly related. By combining,New Zealand and United States interceptions of true bark beetles we obtained data on species found in shipments,from,around the world. Logistic regression analysis showed,that frequently intercepted species were about four times as likely as rarely intercepted species to be established somewhere.,Interception records of wood,and bark borers are valuable for the prediction of invaders and for our gen- eral understanding of invasions. The use of alternatives to solid wood packaging, such as processed wood, should be encouraged,to reduce the spread of invasive wood,and bark borers.
