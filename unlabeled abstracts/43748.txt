Checklist of aquatic non-native and invasive species in lakes Mead and Mohave
More than half of National Parks in the United States report the presence of invasive animals. Here we report a checklist of non-native aquatic fauna at Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Nevada, with the earliest reported sighting in 1940. Seventy-two species of non-native aquatic fauna were found representing six taxonomic groups. 41 (57%) are established, 9 (13%) are either eradicated or failed, and the status of 19 species (26%) is unknown. This comprehensive species list represents a preliminary step in developing monitoring programs for invasive species currently found within Lakes Mead and Mohave. It will also help inform the development of early detection and rapid response activities and monitoring to safeguard the park from future invasions.
