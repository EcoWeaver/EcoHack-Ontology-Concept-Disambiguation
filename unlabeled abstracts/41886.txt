Understanding public perceptions toward invasive species in different parts of Europe
Understanding public attitudes toward invasive species is crucial to curtail the reasons for their introduction and to increase the effectiveness of control measures. A questionnaire was distributed in three European countries (Italy, Spain and United Kingdom) to evaluate public attitudes on the problems posed by invasive species, their perception of the impacts and their willingness to introduce and support management actions. People whose occupations are not nature related or who practice gardening as a main outdoor activity, represent the highest risk groups relating to the introduction of invasive species. Ecosystem damage and species extinctions were the main concerns for people, and signal crayfish and zebra mussel were the species of most concern. People firstly supported control and eradication followed by awareness resulting in increasing public awareness as management measures. This information can feed into educational, prevention and eradication campaigns promoting the necessary socio-cultural changes to prevent the negative impacts of invasive species.
