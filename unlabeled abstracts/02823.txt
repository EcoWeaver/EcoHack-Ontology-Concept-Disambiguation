Invasion dynamics of white-nose syndrome fungus, midwestern United States, 2012-2014.
White-nose syndrome has devastated bat populations in eastern North America. In Midwestern United States, prevalence increased quickly in the first year of invasion (2012-13) but with low population declines. In the second year (2013-14), environmental contamination led to earlier infection and high population declines. Interventions must be implemented before or soon after fungal invasion to prevent population collapse. (c) 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All rights reserved.
