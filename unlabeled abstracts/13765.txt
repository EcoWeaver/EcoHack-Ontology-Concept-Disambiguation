Occurrence and ITS diversity of wood-associatedBursaphelenchusnematodes in Scots pine forests in Switzerland
The quarantine pathogen Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Pine Wood Nematode - PWN) represents a serious threat for Pinus species in Europe. To exclude its presence in Switzerland, in 2010 and 2011 we conducted a countrywide survey in 102 Pinus sylvestris stands chosen according to whether they contained dying or dead trees or were located in areas of risk of PWN introduction. Totally, 285 trees (1-5 per site) were sampled. Nematodes were extracted from wood chips using a standard procedure, and identified to species by ITS sequencing. Bursaphelenchus species were present in 34% of the trees, but no B. xylophilus was identified, i.e. PWN is still not present in Switzerland. The nematodes found belonged to seven different species, with B. vallesianus the most frequent species, followed by B. sexdentati, B. mucronatus kolymensis, and B. eggersi. Three other species (B. borealis, B. pinophilus, B. poligraphi) were each only present in one or two trees. Three groups of sequences could not be assigned to a species because of the lack of matching reference sequences. The species composition found in Switzerland suggests a co-existence of southern and central European Bursaphelenchus species. Intraspecific ITS variability differed considerably among the four most common species. B. eggersi, B. mucronatus kolymensis, and B. sexdentati had several variable sites in the ITS region, resulting in multiple ITS genotypes in each species. In contrast, all 99 B. vallesianus isolates had an identical ITS region. This could indicate a founder effect, and possibly that B. vallesianus is not native to the Alpine region.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
