Pyropia suborbiculata(Bangiales, Rhodophyta): first records from the northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean of this North Pacific species
Pyropia suborbiculata is a bladed Bangiales originally reported from Asia that has also been recorded as an introduction in Atlantic USA, New Zealand, Vietnam, Canary Islands and Brazil. Here we report for the first time the expansion of its distribution to Europe (Northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts) on the basis of collections from the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal). Comparison of morphological and molecular data of our specimens with those of Py. suborbiculata confirms conspecificity and allowes us to differentiate it from other similar species traditionally reported in this area. Its extensive distribution in the Iberian Peninsula and identical rbcL sequences with native and introduced strains suggests a recent introduction probably from the NW Pacific following the example of a lot of exotic seaweeds introduced in Europe. Although this is the first report in Europe of this taxon, it could have been easily overlooked until now because of its small thalli
