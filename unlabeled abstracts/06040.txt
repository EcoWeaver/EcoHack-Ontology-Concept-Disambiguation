Intracellular Growth and Morphological Characteristics of Legionella pneumophila during Invasion and Proliferation in Different Cells
Various studies have been made to attempt to study the interaction between Legionella pneumophila and the host cells. In this research, we successfully constructed a L. pneumophila mutant strain that stably expressed high levels of green fluorescent protein and used this strain to evaluate the adherence, invasion and proliferation of L. pneumophila in association with several cell lines, including seven cell lines [human macrophage-like cell lines (U937, THP-1), murine macrophage-like cell lines (J774.1A, Raw264.7), human bronchial epithelial cell lines (16HBE, Beas-2B) and human cerrical cancer cell line (HeLa)] which have been used as the host models of L. pneumophila, and two breast carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). Our results showed that the two newly tested cell lines are able to support the intracellular proliferation of L. pneumophila, and there were some morphological variations during the invasion and intracellular replication of L. pneumophila in different cell lines. These results can help us find out the common and special patterns of invasion and proliferation of L. pneumophila within different hosts. This is conducive to our knowledge on the relationship and interaction between bacteria and host. Graphical Abstract Fullsize Image
