Isolation and characterization of 18 novel polymorphic microsatellite markers from the Mayan cichlid (Cichlasoma urophthalmus)
We isolated and characterized 18 microsatellite loci from the Mayan cichlid, Cichlasoma urophthalmus. Loci were screened for 24 specimens from a total of seven sites in south Florida, Mexico, Belize and Honduras. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 21, observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.208 to 0.875, and the probability of identity values ranged from 0.012 to 0.203. These new loci will provide tools for identifying the source population(s) for the introduction of Mayan cichlids in south Florida and for comparing population genetic structure of Mayan cichlids within and among subpopulations in its native (Central America) and introduced ranges (south Florida). Mayan cichlids are an invasive species in south Florida so identifying source populations may reveal pathways that can be managed to prevent further introductions. Mayan cichlids may also be useful as a model system in which to examine the relationship between introduction history, population genetic diversity, and invasibility.
