A new aspect of grassland vegetation dynamics: cyanobacterium colonies affect establishment success of plants
Cyanobacteria may have considerable effects on community functioning, mostly because they produce various metabolites that adversely affect other organisms. Here we synthesized existing knowledge about the effects of toxic cyanobacteria on the germination and growth of terrestrial plants. We also aimed to test the chemical effects of a Nostoc (Cyanobacteria) extract on the germination and growth of species of alkali habitats to investigate whether cyanobacteria can alter community structure and diversity via affecting the establishment success of plants.
