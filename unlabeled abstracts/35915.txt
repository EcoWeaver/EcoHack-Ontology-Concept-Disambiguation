Effect of Temperature on the Reproductive Potential of Indigenous and Exotic Species of Entomopathogenic Nematodes inside Galleria mellonella L. Larvae
The influence of different temperature ranges on the reproductive potential of native and exotic species of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) was checked on Galleria mellonella larvae. The native species included Steinernema asiaticum and Heterorhabditis indica whereas exotic species were S. feltiae and H. bacteriophora. G. mellonella larvae were exposed to 300 IJs of each species. After inoculation at different temperatures, the reproductive potential of EPNs increased with increasing temperature and was found to be the best at 25degC. No EPNs species could reproduce at 5degC. S. feltiae started reproduction at 10degC, while all remaining species reproduced at 15degC or higher temperatures. Maximum numbers of IJs were recovered from H. bacteriophora. Time taken for first emergence of IJs from the host was shortest at 25degC i.e. 7-8 days in case of S. asiaticum and S. feltiae, while 11-13 days for H. bacteriophora and H. indica. Maximum emergence time was taken by S. feltiae at 10degC.
