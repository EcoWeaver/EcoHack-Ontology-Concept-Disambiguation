Protocol for Transferring Bare-rooted Native Plant Seedlings to Restoration Sites - Preventing the Spread of Invasive Species Contaminants
Seedling transfer is commonly used for restoration ecology, however, still many projects do not take into consideration the risk of invasive species contaminants, especially invisible contaminants such as eggs, seeds, spores, mycelium, and small-sized organisms. Here we reviewed literature in order to provide a low cost and simple protocol to avoid the spread of invasive species in forests and other restored sites in four summarized points used in a restoration project in a Tahitian forest (French Polynesia).1- minimize distance between nursery and transplantation site; 2- use sterile or neutral substrate (from the transplantation site), isolate from the surrounding soil; 3- treat against fungi and invertebrates; 4- avoid substrate transport prior to transfer to transplantation site.
