Mechanisms of invasions: can the recipient community influence invasion rates?
Abstract At least since,Elton's work,in the 1950s it has,been argued,that properties of recipient communities,influence invasion rates. The widespread view, initiated by Elton and,later supported,by,both,empirical,and,modelling studies, is that species-rich communities are more resis- tant to invasion,than species-poor,communities,in other- wise identical habitats. However, the dynamics of some empirical systems do not support this idea, but reveal instead,a positive relationship between,species,richness and invasion, reflecting the particular attributes of com- ponent,species,and,their interactions. These,findings cannot,be,explained,solely,by,Shea,and,Chesson's (2002) attempt,to reconcile,divergent,observations,of both,positive and,negative,relationships,between,inva- sion rates and richness of the recipient community. Here, based on the behaviours of several models, we develop an alternative view that invasion success,is related posi- tively to variability in resource,availability. This variability can arise in many ways, dependent in part on the life history features of component species, the nature of interactions among species, and the spatial arrangement
