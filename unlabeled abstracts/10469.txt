Robust detection protocols for uncertain introductions of invasive species.
Two important features of real-world port inspections of shipping containers for invasive species are the general absence of underlying economic considerations and the climate of severe uncertainty that surrounds the likelihood of invasive species introductions. In this article we propose and illustrate a method for determining inspection protocols that address both of these issues. We seek inspection protocols that are robust in the sense that they maximize the range of uncertainty over which the expected loss from the introduction of an invasive species plus the costs of inspections do not exceed some critical value. These inspection strategies are practical and provide ready alternatives to existing protocols.
