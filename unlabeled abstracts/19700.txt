Predicting spread of invasive macrophytes in New Zealand lakes using indirect measures of human accessibility
1. Models predicting invasive macrophyte spread between lakes provide an important tool for focusing proactive management efforts to lakes deemed susceptible to invasion. However, challenges to forecasting macrophyte spread include wide physiological tolerances of invasive macrophytes and a lack of information on the relative importance of the various human vectors (e.g. boating traffic). In New Zealand, three invasive species that reproduce vegetatively, Ceratophyllum demersum, Lagarosiphon major, Egeria densa, and a single species that reproduces sexually, Utricularia gibba, are currently spreading across the lake landscape at a great cost to the local ecology and economy.
