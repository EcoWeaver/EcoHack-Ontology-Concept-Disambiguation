First report of three predatory bugs (Heteroptera: Miridae) in tomato fields infested by the invasive South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta in Niger: an opportunity for biological control?
An increase in international trades in goods and services and the movement of humans in recent decades has led to a concomitant increase in the number of exotic insects invading new areas, with some establishing as harmful agricultural pests. That is how the South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) has recently and rapidly invaded Niger except the Diffa region. This new pest represents a real threat for tomato production in the country. To this end, the first step includes identifying the fortuitous natural enemies present. For this purpose in Niger, five tomato-infested fields from three distant and climatically different agricultural regions were sampled, with a particular focus on predatory mirids. Based on morphological characters and molecular barcoding approach, Nesidiocoris tenuis, N. volucer and N. callani (Miridae: Dyciphini) were reported for the first time in Niger and associated with tomato pests providing new insights upon their distribution areas and ecology, and genetic diversity. These findings are discussed in the framework of T. absoluta management and also the need of accurately identifying the community of natural enemies when facing invasive species.
