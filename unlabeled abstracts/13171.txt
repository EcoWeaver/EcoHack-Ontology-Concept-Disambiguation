Conservation assessment of Lecythidaceae from eastern Brazil
This work evaluates the conservation status of the 22 species of Lecythidaceae native to eastern Brazil. Assessments based on current IUCN criteria, distribution maps, and an identification key to the native and non-native species from the area are provided. The results of this study suggest that over half of the species are threatened (vulnerable or endangered), four species should be added to the IUCN Red List, and the status of seven species currently on this list should be changed. It was found that nearly all collections of endangered species are from or occur within 20 km of a reserve, which clearly shows that protected areas are of vital importance for the survival of most endangered Lecythidaceae from this region.
