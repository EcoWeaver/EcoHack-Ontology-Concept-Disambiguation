Alveolar echinococcosis in nutria (Myocastor coypus), invasive species in Slovenia
The present report describes a case of Echinococcus multilocularis infection in nutria (Myocastor coypus) culled in the central area of Slovenia. Post-mortem exam showed multiple cystic lesions in the liver. Gross examination, as well as parasitological and histopathological examinations, revealed numerous cysts of various sizes, filled with yellow clear fluid and displacing most of the liver parenchyma. The cyst lumina contained numerous protoscolices approximately 100 mm in diameter and calcareous corpuscles. The protoscolices had two visible suckers and a rostellum with birefringent hooks. The lesions were consistent with an E. multilocularis cyst. Molecular analysis confirmed that the nutria was infected with E. multilocularis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of echinococcosis in nutria in Slovenia that presents gross, parasitological, and histological lesions and the result of molecular analysis. Nutrias in Slovenia are dangerous invaders but can also be a relevant bioindicator of the presence of the parasite in the environment.
