The non-indigenous and invasive species Paraleucilla magnaKlautau, Monteiro & Borojevic, 2004 (Porifera: Calcarea) in the Algerian coast (Southwestern of Mediterranean Sea)
The non-indigenous and invasive calcareous sponge Paraleucilla magna Klautau, Monteiro & Borojevic, 2004 has been detected for the first time on the Algerian coast. Anthropogenic activities such as aquaculture farms or shipping traffic might be important vectors or act as stepping-stones in its further expansion. Additional recording of the species adds to the knowledge of its biogeography distribution, biology and ecology in the Mediterranean and may improve selection of key geographical sites for future monitoring on the species proliferation and expansion.
