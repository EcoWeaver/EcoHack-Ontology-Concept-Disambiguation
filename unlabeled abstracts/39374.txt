New data on the monitoring of dangerous invasive insect species in Abkhazia
The article presents the monitoring data of the three most dangerous invasive insect species in the territory of Abkhazia: palm borer Paysandisia archon (Burmeister), boxwood moth Cydalima perspectalis (Walker), red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier). All of them penetrated into Abkhazia in the period from 2014 to 2016 from the Russian Federation. The penetration of invasive species is accompanied by serious ecological and economic consequences. Pest populations show resilience and expansion of forage plant infestation zones. To control pest populations, regular pesticide treatments are required for Buxus colchica boxwood stands, as well as for all types of trees used in the green architecture of Abkhazian cities.
