Vachellia farnesiana (L.) Wight & Arn., a potentially invasive tree in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
Vachellia farnesiana was in cultivation in South Africa as an ornamental tree as early as 1858. The first non-cultivated specimen was collected in 1888 and the first naturalised population in 1952. We surveyed 4.5 km along a seasonal watercourse near Albert Falls Dam in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where a V. farnesiana population was identified in 2016. We found a total of 1203 trees of V. farnesiana, of which 82% of the trees produced fruit. Field observations suggest that this species has the potential to become invasive in South Africa.
