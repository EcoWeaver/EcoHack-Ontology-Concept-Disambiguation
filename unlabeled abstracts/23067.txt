Earthworm populations in relation to soil organic matter dynamics and management in California tomato cropping systems
Earthworms are key regulators of soil structure and soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in many agroecosystems. They are greatly impacted by agricultural management, yet little is known about how these factors interact to control SOM dynamics. This study sought to explore linkages between agricultural management, earthworms and aggregate associated SOM dynamics through a survey of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cropping systems in northern California. Earthworms and soil samples were collected between February and April of 2005 from 16 fields under one of three types of residue management: (1) tomato mulch - no postharvest tillage and tomato residues left on the soil surface, (2) cover crop - tomato residues tilled in and leguminous cover crop planted, and (3) bare fallow - tomato residues tilled in and soil surface left exposed throughout the winter. Earthworms were collected via hand-sorting and identified to species, while soils were wet sieved to yield four aggregate size classes: large macroaggregates (>2000mm), small macroaggregates (250-2000mm), microaggregates (53-250mm) and the silt and clay fraction (
