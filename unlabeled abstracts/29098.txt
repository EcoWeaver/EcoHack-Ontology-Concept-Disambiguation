Limited dispersal prevents Quercus rubra invasion in a 14-species common garden experiment
Aim Information about the importance of propagule pressure and habitat invasibility in invasion success of dispersal-limited species is scarce. We aimed to assess invasiveness of Quercus rubra within stands of 14 tree species, and the effects of distance from propagule source on invasion success, to highlight limiting factors for further application in nature conservation. Location Siemianice Experimental Forest--a common garden forest experiment with 14 tree species, western Poland. Methods We investigated aboveground biomass, leaf area index and density of Q. rubra natural regeneration within 53 experimental plots, as well as distance from the seed source. We also analysed light availability changes between 2005 and 2015 on plots of each tree species. We used multiple linear regression and variable importance to quantify the effect of each factor. Results All factors tested influenced ecological success of Q. rubra. Invasion success decreased with increasing distance from the seed source and decreasing light availability and was higher within stands of pioneer tree species. Leaf area index depended mostly on tree stand species, density depended on distance from the propagule source and biomass depended on both. Light availability explained 7.2%-30.2% of the variance; tree species--from 36.1% to 57.4%; and distance from the propagule source--from 12.4% to 56.7%. Main conclusions Tree stand species, light availability and distance from the propagule source influence ecological success of invasive Q. rubra, displaying their importance for spread of this species. These factors are controllable in forest/conservation management and may be used to prevent Q. rubra invasion. Planting late-successional tree species that cast dense shade, maintaining canopy closure and removing fruiting trees from surrounding more invasible stands may prevent Q. rubra invasion.
