Impact of natural enemies on Obolodiplosis robiniae invasion
The gall midge Obolodiplosis robiniae is a pest of black locust Robinia pseudoacacia. The species was recently introduced into Europe and it is nowadays a usual insect in Slovakia, where two-year field surveys were undertaken during 2007-2008. The main objective of this study was to determine the natural enemies attacking O. robiniae and estimate their influence on midge population, less than 3 years after its introduction. Eight parasitoids and bushcricket Tettigonia viridissima were responsible for midge regulation. The parasitoid complex was not typically that of an introduced species as it was predicted. Firstly, the midge was heavily influenced by a specialized parasitoid Platygaster robiniae, which was a predominant parasitoid and accounted for 98% of all specimens reared. Secondly, annual larval parasitism varied from 5.4 to 10.8%, though the late season average parasitism achieved 26.0% and often exceeded 40%. P. robiniae was also very efficient in exploiting galls and was capable of consistently regulating midge population. The surveys demonstrated that the average cumulative impact of natural enemies on the midge was substantial. Stably around 20% of attacked galls were recorded during the late summer. Bushcrickets were as efficient as parasitoids and played an important role at control, especially during lack of parasitoids. Greater impact of parasitoids was found in the larger settlements than it was in the countryside, when countertendency was valid for bushcrickets. There is an indication that O. robiniae parasitized by specialized parasitoid, and attacked by bushcrickets represents only a moderate risk for R. pseudoacacia or forest stands.
