An alien approach to invasive species: objectivity and society in invasion biology
Several authors have recently argued that invasion biologists should adopt a more objective and dispassionate stance towards invasive species. Brown and Sax (Austral Ecol 29:530-536, 2004; Austral Ecol 30:481-483, 2005) assert that invasion biologists risk their objectivity, "commit the naturalist fallacy" or "embark on a slippery slope" with engaged concern about invasive species. Elsewhere, Colautti and MacIsaac (Divers Distrib 10:135-141, 2004) propose a neutral language for invasion biology, one that insulates scientific from popular discussion about invasive species. While there is certainly hyperbole about the effects of some invasive species, the type of objectivity promoted in these papers may often be inappropriate for invasion biology. It implies a policy of non-action that is inconsistent with the conservation values of many invasion biologists. To engage these values, invasion biologists can adopt deliberative methods for environmental problem-solving that involve stakeholders in their research design and which still promote high standards of scientific rigor.
