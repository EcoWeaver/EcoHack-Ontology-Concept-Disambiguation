Prioritizing rat eradication on islands by cost and effectiveness to protect nesting seabirds
To prioritize conservation actions on Italian islands we used the case study of the eradication of the Black rat Rattus rattus to protect Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea and Yelkouan shearwater Puffinus yelkouan. We evaluated for each island the effectiveness of rat eradication by means of two different indices, both based on the relative importance of the island's nesting population of the two species at the national and regional scale, but differing in the parameters set at the divisor, i.e., respectively, the number of nesting pairs in rat-free islands and the number of islands occupied by shearwaters. We estimated analytically the monetary costs of rat eradication on each island. Islands at high risk of recolonization were excluded from further analyses, while costs and effectiveness of rat eradication were compared for the remaining islands. Rat eradication was most cost-effectively carried out on the island hosting the largest colony of P. yelkouan. Eradicating rats from all the islands in the ranking provided benefits to 63.9% of the Italian population of P. yelkouan, but only to 7.1% of that of C. diomedea. Comparing costs and effectiveness of all possible island combinations, ranging from a minimum budget of 50,000 EUR and a maximum of 1600,000 EUR (i.e. the cost for eradicating rats from all the listed islands), the maximum increase in effectiveness (marginal effectiveness) fell around a relatively small budget (200,000 EUR). For both species, when adopting the cost/effectiveness rankings, the number of pairs protected for 1000 EUR of investment was significantly higher than adopting rankings of effectiveness alone, demonstrating that conservation priorities are more efficiently identified by including monetary costs in the analysis.
