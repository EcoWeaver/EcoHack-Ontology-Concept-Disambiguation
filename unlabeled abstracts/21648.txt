Non-indigenous Japanese oyster drill Pteropurpura (Ocinebrellus) inornata (Recluz, 1851) (Gastropoda: Muricidae) on the South-west coast of Portugal
The Japanese oyster drill or rock snail Pteropurpura (Ocinebrellus) inornata (Recluz, 1851), a marine mollusc, belonging to the family Muricidae, is reported from Portugal for the first time. This non-indigenous species, most likely introduced accidentally from French oyster rearing areas into mainland Portugal, has been regularly sampled in shellfish-culture and nearby environments in Sagres, Algarve, South-west Portugal since 2005-2008. Detailed studies are urgently needed in order to assess whether or not it has become an invasive species due to a range expansion beyond its point of initial introduction. Outputs should provide information to decision-makers to predict and limit further spread which might result in biodiversity loss and negative economical consequences in locally species-rich areas.
