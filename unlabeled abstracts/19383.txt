Isolation of fourteen novel polymorphic microsatellite markers for alien or invasive species: monitoring and management of the mud snail Bullacta exarata Philippi, 1849
The mud snail Bullacta exarata is commercially one of the most important marine snails in China, endemic to the coastlines of north-east China and west South Korea. However there is controversy regarding whether the mud snail is an invasive species or whether Laizhou Bay has a historical natural distribution, with little information available on population genetics. In this study, 14 novel polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated from the mud snail, and characterized in wild stock from Laizhou Bay of China. The number of alleles varied between 4 and 19, and the observed and expected heterozygosity at the population level varied from 0.1875 to 1.0000 and 0.7172 to 0.9379, respectively. Five locus Bex26-166, Bex28-188, Bex29-115, Bex32-179 and Bex34-148 significantly deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P < 0.01). These microsatellite markers will be useful for population genetics, alien and invasive species identification, parentage studies of this species.
