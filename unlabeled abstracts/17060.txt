Community invasibility and invasion by non-native Fraxinus pennsylvanica trees in a degraded tropical forest
Whether invasion of introduced plant species may be aided by certain community properties is poorly understood for species-rich ecosystems, such as tropical montane forests. In Kenya, the non-native tree Fraxinus pennsylvanica has invaded degraded montane forests. We used generalized linear mixed models to examine the relative importance of different community properties to Fraxinus invasion after agricultural abandonment and in the secondary forest. Fraxinus invasion was positively related to plant community species diversity and the abundance of tree saplings, shrubs, ferns, and herbs in the abandoned fallows, but negatively related to the same community properties in the secondary forest. The number of Fraxinus recruits declined with declining propagule pressure in the fallows, but not in the secondary forest. Although adult and saplings of Fraxinus were positively related to community diversity in the fallows, Fraxinus appeared to decrease diversity in the secondary forest. These results show that the success of non-native species invasion and the effects of an invader on the resident community may depend both on properties and degree of disturbance of the community. Plant community diversity and evenness appeared to determine the invasion success by increasing invasibility of the abandoned fallows, but decreasing invasibility of the secondary forest. Our results from a tropical degraded forest emphasize the importance of including habitat characteristics when predicting both the potential of non-native plant invasion and effects of invasives on the particular community.
