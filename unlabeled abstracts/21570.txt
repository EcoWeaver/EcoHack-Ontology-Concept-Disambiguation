Invasive alien species dispersal: the millennium biodiversity disaster
Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to analyze the different modes of species dispersal and the various types of alien species dispersed in the Indian peninsular region and its impact on the eco system and livelihoods. Design/methodology/approach - The paper portrays the various identified alien species, the scale of invasion thereby resulting in biological disaster caused by mankind. Findings - The paper lists the invasive alien species (IAS) are those that are transmitted from their own ecological niche and to a new niche due to human influence, which causes the biodiversity disaster. International boundaries are indeed porous to the intentional and unintentional movement of species from various eco systems in the country. Originality/value - It is felt that few initiatives are being taken by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and governance of eco system from IAS is a necessity. Sustainable eco system governance (SESG) from invasive alien species should be emphasized to avoid biodiversity disasters that will have an impact on food security and nutrition of human beings.
