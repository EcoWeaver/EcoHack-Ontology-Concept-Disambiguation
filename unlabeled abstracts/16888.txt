Molecular analysis confirms the introduction of a second species of yellow peacock cichlid Cichla monoculus Spix & Agassiz 1831 (Cichliformes: Cichlidae) in the Southeast Atlantic Hydrographic province, Brazil
Cichla kelberi, Cichla monoculus, and Cichla ocellaris are recognised as the most widespread introduced species of yellow peacock cichlids but most studies have failed to accurately identify these species in the invaded systems. The present study used molecular analysis to firstly confirm the introduction of C. monoculus in the Southeast Atlantic Hydrographic province, which encompasses areas from the three most populated Brazilian states. The cytochrome b sequences of 13 yellow peacock cichlids captured at two reservoirs from Paraiba do Sul river basin confirmed six of them as C. monoculus and seven as C. kelberi. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the six C. monoculus caught in the Paraiba do Sul river clustered in a well-supported clade with other C. monoculus sequences available in GenBank. Some individuals showed divergences in colouration pattern from that of the original description of C. monoculus, suggesting that this species could be interbreeding with C. kelberi. Our findings stressed the applied importance of using molecular approaches to accurately detect invasive cryptic species and to track the spread of yellow peacock cichlids outside their native range.
