Distribution of the invasive bivalve Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834) in Croatia
The Chinese pond mussel Sinanodonta woodiana is an invasive bivalve species present in the flowing and standing waters of most of Europe. Field research conducted from 2007 to 2011 indicated that this species has colonised the entire eastern part of Croatia, and that its spread westward is continuing. During our study, S. woodiana was recorded at 54 localities.
