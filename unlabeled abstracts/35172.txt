Small Spruce Bark Beetle Ips amitinus (Eichhoff, 1872) (Coleoptera, Curculionidae: Scolytinae): a New Alien Species in West Siberia
The small spruce bark beetle Ips amitinus is a widespread species in many European countries that has been actively spreading into Northern Europe in the recent decades. In Russia, I. amitinus is present in the western, northwestern, and northern regions of the European part, with a tendency for range expansion. The species was first recognized in West Siberia in 2019 by characteristic morphological features and molecular genetic analysis. This bark beetle is abundant on Pinus sibirica in Siberian pine forests located near settlements within Tomsk and Kemerovo provinces, and is also sporadically found on the Siberian spruce Picea obovata. It colonizes the upper trunk and branches of standing and windfall trees. In the outbreak foci this bark beetle causes catastrophic drying of Siberian pines, starting from the crown top. This pattern of tree drying was noted for the first time near settlements in Yashkinsky District of Kemerovo Province in 2014, and now outbreak foci of I. amitinus exist in all the Siberian pine forests in this district. The population growth of I. amitinus was probably facilitated by dry and hot summer weather in the southeast of West Siberia during the last decade, in 2011 and 2012, and also by heavy winter snowfalls leaving numerous snapped tree branches which are easily colonized by the pest. In Tomsk Province, the most active outbreak focus of I. amitinus appeared in 2018 in the Siberian pine forest near Luchanovo and Ipatovo, following an outbreak of the Siberian moth Dendrolimus sibiricus. The invasion of I. amitinus in Siberia may increase the degradation rates not only of the gene-reserve Siberian pine forests but also of other dark coniferous stands.
