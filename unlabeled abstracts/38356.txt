The invasive American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) in the Republic of Korea: history and recommendations for population control
- Accepted in Management of Biological Invasions - The American bullfrog, Lithobates catesbeianus, has been introduced to all continents with suitable environments and most populations are now viable. This is also the case of the Korean Peninsula, where the invasive L. catesbeianus has a significant negative impact on the local fauna. Here, we review the introduction pathway and population establishment for the species in the Republic of Korea. We then review effective population control methods and make recommendations for the most efficient ways to manage L. catesbeianus populations based on the specific environment of the Republic of Korea. This is the first account of the multiple introductions of the species in the country, the past failures at population establishments, and also the first summary of population control methods that had an impact on population mitigation before their abortion. Our recommendations for population control are based on the local ecology and landscapes and highlight the need for multiple control methods to be used in synergy.
