Checklist of non-native benthic macroinvertebrates and fish in the Dnieper River basin
An annotated checklist of non-native benthic macroinvertebrates and fish in 6 sub-basins (assessment units) of the Dnieper River is presented (based on a literature survey and the author's unpublished data). In total, the checklist includes 92 non-native aquatic species (invertebrates - 57, fish - 35), primarily of Ponto-Caspian origin. This background information provides support for possible future development of relevant management options towards control of invasive species in the studied area, which is an important part of the European network of inland waterways and the European inland water "central invasion corridor".
