Effect of substratum drying on the survival and migrations of Ponto-Caspian and native gammarids (Crustacea: Amphipoda)
Organisms inhabiting shallow near-shore waters are at risk of desiccation during water level fluctuations. Using laboratory experiments, we investigated the survival and behavioural defences of four freshwater amphipod species during substratum drying: three Ponto-Caspian invaders (Pontogammarus robustoides, Dikerogammarus haemobaphes and Dikerogammarus villosus) and the native Gammarus fossarum. We hypothesized that they would be able to survive air exposure events as well as to adjust their behaviour by following the decreasing water level and/or burying in the sediments. To test these hypotheses, we examined survival of each species on gradually drying sandy substratum as well as their horizontal and vertical migration behaviours. P. robustoides was most resistant to substratum drying and was the only species burying into the substratum. On the other hand, G. fossarum exhibited distinct horizontal migrations following the retreating waterline. These two species seem to be particularly well adapted to the drying environment. Defence mechanisms of D. haemobaphes and D. villosus were less efficient, though the former species also followed the retreating waterline to some extent. Our study demonstrates that exotic and native gammarids have several adaptations that enable them to invade and persist in habitats experiencing common water level fluctuations.
