The effects of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) and the native antPrenolepis imparison the structure of insect herbivore communities on willow trees (Salix lasiolepis)
Abstract 1. We examined the relative effects of the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, and a common native ant, Prenolepis imparis, on the community of herbivorous insects occurring on willow trees, Salix lasiolepis in Northern California, U.S.A. 2. Using paired control and treatment branches from which we excluded ants and other non-volant predators, we found that effects of Argentine ants on the herbivore community were generally similar to those of P. imparis. Argentine ants and P. imparis suppressed the damage by skeletonising insects by 50%, but had little effect on most other external-feeding or internal-feeding guilds. 3. The abundance of aphids was 100% greater in the presence of Argentine ants, but there was no effect on aphid numbers in the presence of P. imparis. Late season aphid numbers were substantially higher in the presence of Argentine ants, but not P. imparis. 4. The effects of Argentine ants on skeletonising insects and aphids combined with the overwhelming abundance of Argentine ant workers, suggests that they may have substantial, but often overlooked, effects on the herbivore communities on other plant species in or near riparian habitats in which they invade.
