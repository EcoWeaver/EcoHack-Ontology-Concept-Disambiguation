The effects of city-suburb-exurb landscape context and distance to the edge on plant diversity of forests in Wuhan, China
We analysed the relative role of landscape context (city, suburb and exurb) and distance to the edge (from forest edge to 45 m in interior) on plant diversity of natural forests in Wuhan city. The results indicated that landscape context had significant effects on plant diversity, and both landscape context and distance to the edge affect vegetation and disturbance characteristics. Landscape context was the main factor affecting richness of woods, herbs, indigenous species, forest generalists and insect or wind pollination species. These species tended to be higher in exurban forests while non-indigenous species were higher in the urban forests. The number of non-indigenous species, forest specialists, herbs and insect pollination species also depended on distance to the edge or on both interactions. Richness of non-indigenous species decreased with increasing distance to the edge in urban forest. Vegetation characteristics that shrub cover was lower and disturbance characteristics that disturbed cover and human activity were higher in the urban edge than in the suburb and exurb edge, which decreased from the edge to the interior. Therefore, we should prioritize the preservation of less disturbed and frequented forests (suburban and exurban) to buffer the invasion of non-indigenous species, and to reserve more indigenous species.
