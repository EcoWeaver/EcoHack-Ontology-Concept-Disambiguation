Interspecific comparison of movement patterns among bitterling species in an agricultural ditch system
Patterns of movement are related to life history and/or species traits. Understanding movement patterns of multiple species sharing the same niche may clarify coexistence mechanisms. Therefore, the movement patterns of three bitterling species, Acheilognathus tabira erythropterus, Acheilognathus melanogaster, and Rhodeus ocellatus ocellatus, were examined between June and November 2009 in an agricultural ditch system associated with Lake Kasumigaura in central Japan. The mark-recapture method was used with a fixed releasing point in an approximately 5.5 km-long ditch. Movement distances of A. t. erythropterus and A. melanogaster were longer than that of R. o. ocellatus, but the direction of movement was similar among the three species. However, R. o. ocellatus moved to locations with a low dissolved oxygen concentration and deeper water. These results suggest that R. o. ocellatus may adapt better to environmental fluctuations, because its tolerance to hypoxia is the highest of the three species. Compared with R. o. ocellatus, A. t. erythropterus and A. melanogaster may move relatively longer distances to search for suitable habitats following an environmental fluctuation.
