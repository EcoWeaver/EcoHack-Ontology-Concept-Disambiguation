Beetle community responses to grey willow (Salix cinerea) invasion within three New Zealand wetlands
We investigated the effects of invasion by introduced grey willow (Salix cinerea) on beetle communities within four wetland vegetation types: native vegetation, native vegetation following grey willow removal, native vegetation undergoing grey willow invasion and dense grey willow-dominated vegetation. In total, 1505 beetles from 90 species were collected using modified Malaise traps. Native wetland vegetation had significantly lower beetle species richness than willow-dominated vegetation and was dominated by herbivores, whereas detritivores characterised willow-dominated vegetation. Beetle abundance was highest in the willow-dominated vegetation and mostly comprised detritivores. In contrast, beetle abundance was lowest in native wetland vegetation, but had even proportions of herbivores and detritivores. Native wetland vegetation had a high proportion of native beetles present. As grey willows invaded, introduced beetles became more common. The beetle community composition differed significantly between grey willow-dominated vegetation and native wetland vegetation. These compositional differences were mainly due to the increasing complexity of vegetation structure following grey willow invasion. The beetle communities within restored native wetland vegetation were most similar to those within the native wetland vegetation. From a conservation perspective, these results are encouraging and suggest that, although grey willows dramatically alter the composition of beetle communities present, these communities can be restored to a beetle fauna that is similar to those found within native wetland through the removal of the willows.
