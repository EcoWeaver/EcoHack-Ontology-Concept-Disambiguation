Invasion of an estuarine transition zone by Dreissena polymorpha veligers had no detectable effect on zooplankton community structure
Large numbers of the filter-feeding larval stage of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) (veligers) have been advected into the estuarine transition zone (ETZ) of the St. Lawrence River. In 1994, they became the dominant member of the tidal freshwater zooplankton assemblage of the ETZ (and subsequently the true estuarine assemblage) during summer months. These changes in community structure have not, however, been reflected in changes in the abundance of preinvasion taxa. Abundance of potential planktonic competitors such as rotifers and the cladoceran Bosmina longirostris fluctuated between years but did not decline following the invasion. Only densities of the copepod Eurytemora affinis declined in 2000 and 2001, but this could not be definitively associated with the invasion. Synchronous variation among different zooplankton groups suggests that environmental forcing related to or correlated with temperature anomalies is the major cause of interannual variation in the abundance of zooplankton taxa. The negative correlation between veliger abundance and salinity indicates that the ETZ acts as a sink for the larval stages of the zebra mussel. Their precise fate remains uncertain, but our study suggests that this invasion has had little or no impact on this pelagic community in spite of the numerical dominance of veligers.
