Abstract Recognizing that high litter fall and its rapid decomposition are key traits of invasive species, litter fall and its decay in Sapium sebiferum Roxb. was studied in a site at Palampur. For this, litter traps of dimension 50x 50x 50 cm 3 were placed in under canopy and canopy gap of the species.
