Modeling the Influence of Resource Availability on Population Densities of Oxyops vitiosa (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a Biological Control Agent of the Invasive Tree Melaleuca quinquenervia
The Australian snout beetle, Oxyops vitiosa, was introduced to south Florida, USA, as a biological control agent of the invasive tree Melaleuca quinquenervia during the spring of 1997. As part of ongoing post-release evaluations of this weevil, we sought to quantify the population density that can be maintained by O. vitiosa larvae when fully exploiting the available melaleuca foliage. Seasonal population densities were modeled as a function of tree size distribution and density, plant phenology, quantity of acceptable foliage (suitable for larval development) and larval consumption values. Larval densities varied dramatically due to fluctuating resource availability and ranged from 830 946 larvae/ha in July-August to >4.5 million larvae/ha in January-February. The expected population density for a generalized (mixed sized) tree distribution was estimated to be 13.9 million larvae/ha. Larval densities increased to 18.8 million larvae/ha per year when large trees (>20 cm diameter at breast height) represented the dominant size class, whereas habitats dominated by medium (10-19 cm) and small (1.3-9 cm) trees were predicted to have larval densities of 11.3 and 6.3 million/year, respectively. Validation data obtained from smaller, more accessible plants suggested that the model overestimated realized yearly larval densities by 9% or 15 416 larvae/ha per year.
