Genetic signature of a recent invasion: The ragged sea hare Bursatella leachii in Mar Menor (SE Spain)
*First data about Bursatella leachii population genetics are shown.*Only one haplotype for each gene (COI & 16S) was detected from 80 lagoonal individuals.*In spite of this genetic homogeneity, it is able to survive and reproduce with success.*Higher genetic diversity for COI gene was found outside Mar Menor coastal lagoon.*Two colour morphotypes were detected but not showing genetic differentiation.
