First record of a walnut shield bearer Coptodisca (Lepidoptera: Heliozelidae) in Europe
A leafminer of the Nearctic genus Coptodisca Walsingham (Lepidoptera: Heliozelidae), a species of potential economic interest, is reported for the first time from Europe, infesting the black (Juglans nigra L.) and the common walnut (Juglans regia L.). Mines were collected since September of 2010 in several sites of two Italian regions (Campania and Lazio). The species is rather similar to Coptodisca juglandella (Chambers), the only Coptodisca known to attack walnuts, but at present, an unambiguous identification cannot be provided because of the unsatisfactory charac- terization of this leafminer and congeneric species. Three generations were recorded per year and leafminers overwinter as mature larvae. The first adults emerged in May-June while mature larvae of the last gener- ation started the overwintering in September. During the last generation of the year, infestation levels of leaves were 100% in all sampled locali- ties. Several species of parasitoids were reared from infested mines, with specimens belonging to the genus Chrysocharis (Hymenoptera: Eulophi- dae) being the most frequent parasitoids.
