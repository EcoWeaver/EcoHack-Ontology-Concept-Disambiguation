Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal: the spread of Hemimysis anomala G.O. Sars, 1907 (bloody red shrimp) in the New York State canal system
In Europe and North America, human-made canals and reservoirs have contributed to the spread of non-native species. The mysid shrimp Hemimysis anomala G.O. Sars, 1907, which is native to the Ponto-Caspian region of Eurasia, expanded its range through intentional stocking in reservoirs and movement through shipping canals within Europe. The species later invaded the Laurentian Great Lakes, most likely through ballast transport in the early 2000s. Our survey of the New York State canal system (USA) found the species at 10 sites, spanning over 80 km of canal, which confirms the species continues to colonize human-made canal systems and that canals may catalyze its spread. We report two primary geographic areas where Hemimysis is present in the New York State canal system--in the Erie Canal east of Oneida Lake and in the Cayuga-Seneca Canal in the Finger Lakes region. Body length was significantly smaller in the western assemblage (CayugaSeneca Canal) compared to the assemblage east of Oneida Lake, but within each geographic area there were no significant differences in the proportion of juveniles relative to adults by longitude or the maximum density by longitude. Future studies should examine the role of surface-water flow and recreational boating traffic in the spread of Hemimysis as well as to what extent canal ecosystems are impacted by the establishment of this omnivorous crustacean.
