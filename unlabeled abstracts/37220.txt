Macroparasites of the Invasive Fish,Cyprinus carpio, in Patagonia, Argentina
The common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) is probably the most widely distributed freshwater fish species and cultured on almost all continents. In South America, researches on parasites from C. carpio are limited. The aim of the present study was to report macroparasites from wild populations inhabiting Neuquen River, which is its southernmost distribution in South America. From spring 2011 to winter 2012, four seasonal samples of fishes were collected from Neuquen River at Ingeniero Ballester dam using gill nets. Fish were dissected and all organs were checked under microscope. All macroparasites were determined and counted allowing calculation of prevalence and mean intensity. In total 33 fish were examined and the following six parasites were recorded: the monogeneans Dactylogyrus extensus in gills and Pseudacolpenteron sp. in the canals of the scales in the lateral line system, the cestode Bothriocephalus sp. in intestine, the nematode Contracaecum sp. in abdominal cavity, and the acanthocephalans Pomphorhynchus patagonicus in intestine and abdominal cavity and Polymorphus sp. in abdominal cavity. The monogenean D. extensus was the species more represented with the highest prevalence and mean intensity. The present study report 6 new records of parasite species in C. carpio from Argentina.
