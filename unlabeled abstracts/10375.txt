Characterization of microsatellite loci in a seed chalcid,Megastigmus spermotrophus(Hymenoptera: Torymidae)
Abstract Highly polymorphic microsatellite markers can supply demographic information on founder events and range expansion following initial introduction of invasive insect species. Six microsatellite loci were isolated from a partial DNA library in order to study the invasion patterns of a seed chalcid, Megastigmus spermotrophus, introduced to Europe and New Zealand. Allelic diversity at all described loci was high, ranging from 17 to 30 alleles per locus. All six loci were successfully amplified in 15 congeneric species.
