Population Biology and Rates of Invasion of Three Introduced Impatiens Species in the British Isles
Impatiens glandulifera was estimated as having a rate of spread of up to 38 km yr-1, compared to a rate of up to 24 km yr-1 for I. parviflora. Impatiens capensis was also studied. The use of vice-county data as opposed to 10 km squares is discussed. To identify characters which enabled I. glandulifera to be so successful, frost tolerance and seed output seem to be important factors. Occasional long distance dispersal events, probably aided by humans, are considered to be responsible for the rapid spread of I. glandulifera. Impatiens glandulifera is a pest plant because it forms dense monospecific stands in damp woodland, swamping all other plants. It is able to do so because of early germination and rapid growth to a height higher than any other British annual. Local spread is limited to 2 m yr-1 from its own ballistic dispersal and to a small multiple of that from animal spread. -from Authors
