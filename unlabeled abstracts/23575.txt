The Effect of Nonnative Salmonids on Social Dominance and Growth of Juvenile Atlantic Salmon
Nonnative species have been shown to negatively impact the native community in which they are introduced. In the Great Lakes, competition with nonnative salmonids may be hindering the restoration efforts of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, a once-native top predator in Lake Ontario. We examined the effects of brown trout S. trutta and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, two nonnative fishes in Lake Ontario, on the social dominance and growth rate of juvenile Atlantic salmon from three strains being used for reintroduction efforts in Lake Ontario. Using seminatural stream channels, we found that the presence of either rainbow trout or brown trout reduced aggression, dominance, and food consumption of the Atlantic salmon. Brown trout had the strongest effect, increasing aggression levels in the channels by a factor of two and sharply reducing the dominance of Atlantic salmon. When both nonnatives were present, initiated aggression by Atlantic salmon decreased by a factor of three and food consumption halved as compared with when the salmon were alone. Consequently, over a 7-d time period, standard growth rate of the Atlantic salmon dropped from no change in mass when alone to a value of -0.3% per day when with the nonnative species. Of the three strains tested, one strain was least affected by the nonnative trouts, implicating genetic differences among the strains and suggesting that one strain may have greater poststocking success in Lake Ontario tributaries with naturalized populations of brown trout and rainbow trout.Received April 26, 2011; accepted January 18, 2012
