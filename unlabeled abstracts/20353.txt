Parasite-mediated intraguild predation as one of the drivers of co-existence and exclusion among invasive and native amphipods (Crustacea)
Parasitism is emerging as one of the forces determining the outcome of biological invasions. Using field survey and laboratory experiments, we investigate parasitism as one of the factors mediating the interactions among invasive and native amphipods. An extensive survey (100 sites) of a small British island, revealed the native Gammarus duebeni celticus to be parasitised by the muscle wasting microsporidian Pleistophora mulleri and the acanthocephalan duck parasite Polymorphus minutus, the introduced European Gammarus pulex only by P. minutus and the North American Crangonyx pseudogracilis by neither. While Gammarus spp. were widespread in rivers (one or both species present in 64% of sites), C. pseudogracilis had a restricted distribution (7% of sites) and always co-occurred with Gammarus spp. In contrast, Gammarus spp. were absent from all pond/reservoir sites, with C. pseudogracilis present in over 90%. While the negative association of C. pseudogracilis with Gammarus spp. undoubtedly results from factors such as physico-chemical tolerance and predation as C. pseudogracilis can be heavily predated by Gammarus spp., it was notable that C. pseudogracilis co-occurred with Gammarus spp. more frequently when the latter were parasitised. Laboratory experiments clearly showed that predation on C. pseudogracilis was greatly diminished when G. d. celticus was parasitised by P. mulleri and G. pulex by P. minutus. Our study provides evidence that parasitism, by mediating a key interspecific interaction, is one of an array of interacting factors that may have a role in driving patterns of exclusion and co-existence in natives and invaders.
