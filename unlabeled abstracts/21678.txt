Occurrence of the non-native blenny Omobranchus punctatus (Valenciennes, 1836) (Perciformes: Blenniidae) in the Amazon coastal zone, Brazil
The muzzled blenny Omobranchus punctatus (Valenciennes, 1836) is native to the Indo-Pacific region. The species has been recorded at a number of locations in the southwestern Atlantic, including the Brazilian states of Bahia, Santa Catarina, and Rio de Janeiro. This fish was probably introduced accidentally in ship fouling, and poses a potential threat to the local ecosystem.
