Differences in Leaf Functional Traits BetweenRhus typhinaand Native Species
The differences in leaf functional traits between invasive and native species are considered to be closely linked to the mechanisms underlying successful plant invasion because co-occurring invasive and native species experience similar or even identical environmental selective pressures. This study aims to determine the differences in leaf functional traits and resource-use strategy between the invader Rhus typhina and the native species Sapindus mukorossi. Leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen concentrations, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf moisture of R. typhina were significantly higher than those of S. mukorossi, but leaf length, leaf width, and single-leaf wet and dry weights of R. typhina were significantly lower than those of S. mukorossi. Plasticity indices of leaf shape index and SLA of R. typhina were obviously higher than those of S. mukorossi, while plasticity indices of single-leaf wet and dry weights, and leaf moisture of R. typhina were obviously lower than those of S. mukorossi. The higher leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen concentrations, SLA, and leaf moisture as well as the high range of phenotypic plasticity of leaf shape index and SLA for R. typhina may confer it a competitive advantage and thus play an important role in its successful invasion.
