FIRST RECORD IN COLOMBIA OF CORBICULA FLUMINEA (MOLLUSCA: BIVALVIA: CORBICULIDAE), AN INVASIVE SPECIES
The bivalve Corbicula fluminea Muller is recorded for the first time in Colombia, in the National Park Isla de Salamanca. This protected area includes freshwater channels and mixohaline lagoons influenced by waters of both the Magdalena River and the Caribbean Sea. This exotic bivalve occurs locally in freshwater channels close to the Magdalena River as well as in the latter, whereas another corbiculid native species, Polymesoda solida, is commonly found in the mixohaline lagoons. Densities of C. fluminea ranged from 10 to 100 ind/m2 along with low numbers of P. solida. Lengths ranged form 10 to 43 mm in a predominant muddy substrate. Local fishermen have stated that C. fluminea was established approximately in 1992; this clam is being artisanally exploited for human consumption along with P. solida, although fishery is mainly focused on the latter, due to its larger size.
