The Riparian Vegetation Disturbed by Two Invasive Alien Plants, Sicyos angulatus and Paspalum distichum var. indutum in South Korea
Biological invasion of alien plants is considered to be one of the most serious threats to biodiversity in riparian zones. The effects of two invasive alien plants, Sicyos angulatus and Paspalum distichum var. indutum, on the flora and community structure of the riparian vegetation were investigated at 22 sites at streams in Korea. Sicyos angulatus has invaded the central Korean Peninsula. This alien plant has caused problems to stream managers because of its aggressive vining growth. It had suppressed native vegetation such as trees, shrubs and tall grasses on bank slope and higher floodplains. Paspalum distichum var. indutum has become more widespread in the southern part of Korea. This invasive plant has shallow rhizomes and creeping, extensively branched stolons. It forms a dense mat over lotic or slowly-flowing water and threatens submerged and short emergent hydrophytes. In order to control the introduction and expansion of alien plants, limitation of artificial disturbances and appropriate alien plant management are needed in riparian areas.
