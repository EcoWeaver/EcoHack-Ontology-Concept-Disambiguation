Linking eelgrass decline and impacts on associated fish communities to European green crab Carcinus maenas invasion
Following their first detection in Newfoundland in 2007, populations of invasive European green crabs Carcinus maenas (Linnaeus, 1758) have increased and spread throughout eelgrass Zostera marina meadows. Green crabs can reduce eelgrass biomass by damaging rhizomes and plant shoots when burrowing for shelter and digging for prey. Empirically demonstrating large spatial-scale impacts of green crabs on eelgrass and subsequent cascading effects on the ecosystem has proven difficult because of the general absence of effective baseline studies prior to an invasion of green crabs. We conducted surveys in Placentia and Bonavista bays, Newfoundland (20 sites) to compare eelgrass and associated fish communities before and after an invasion of green crabs. We analyzed eelgrass surveys from 1998 and 1999 (before green crab) and again in 2012 (after green crab) using a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) study design in order to isolate effects of crab-induced eelgrass loss from effects independent of green crabs. Underwater video sampling evaluated eelgrass change over time and indicated a 50% decline in eelgrass percent cover since 1998 at sites with green crabs, and eelgrass declines up to 100% at sites with highest abundances and longest established presence of green crabs. Beach seining showed a sharp decline in abundance and biomass of fish (~10-fold between sites with and without green crabs) and indicated changes in fish community structure after green crab arrival at a site. Our results suggest cascading effects on fish communities and substantial potential impacts in coastal ecosystems occur following green crab invasion.
