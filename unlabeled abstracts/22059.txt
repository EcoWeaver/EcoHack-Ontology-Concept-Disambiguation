Are alien fish disadvantaged by extremely variable flow regimes in arid-zone rivers?
The proliferation of alien fish in dryland rivers potentially obstructs the maintenance of river health. Modified flow regimes are hypothesised to facilitate invasions by alien fish but in unregulated dryland rivers, large floods provide a recruitment advantage for native over alien species whereas droughts favour alien species. We tested these hypotheses by using data from a 3-year study (20002003) of fish populations in the unmodified rivers of the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB) of Australia. Results from a lower reach of Cooper Creek were compared with those of an earlier study (19861992). During both periods, large floods occurred, with return periods ranging from 1 in 5 to 1 in 25 years. In the lower Cooper, decreases in the abundance of alien species relative to native species, and dramatic increases in recruitment of native species, were observed during a 13-year period following large floods. In two other rivers in 20002003, there was no statistically significant change in the already low abundances of alien species. We suggest that the naturally variable hydrological regimes and native-dominant fish assemblages of the unregulated LEB rivers afford some resistance to the establishment and proliferation of alien fish through flood and drought conditions.
