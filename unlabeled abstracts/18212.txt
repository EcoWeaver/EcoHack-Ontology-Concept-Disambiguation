Growth and bleaching of the coral Oculina patagonica under different environmental conditions in the western Mediterranean Sea
The success that the putative alien species Oculina patagonica is able to survive under different environmental conditions may be benefiting its establishment and spread- ing along the Mediterranean Basin. Our objectives were to determine the response of this species, in terms of growth and bleaching, under different environmental conditions. Field data on colony growth and bleaching were obtained for a period of 18 months (from June 2010 to December 2011), in the Ali- cante Harbour (38deg20'11''N, 00deg29'11''W) and the Marine Protected Area of Tabarca (38deg09'59''N, 00deg28'56''W). Addi- tionally, data on sedimentation rates, chlorophyll a concen- tration and organic matter were also collected. Moreover, the role of light over growth and bleaching of the coral was also studied with a field experiment. Our results showed that growth rates were similar among localities (eutrophic and oli- gotrophic environments), decreasing with increasing perim- eter of the colony. Growth rates were at a minimum during cold months (13 degC) and enhanced during warm months until a threshold temperature; thereafter, bleaching was observed (>28 degC), being adverse for coral growth. In addition, light attenuation could act such as local stress, increasing the coral bleaching with the increase in seawater temperature. Our findings confirmed that O. patagonica has a broad tolerance to seawater temperature, irradiance and trophic water con- ditions, in addition to its ability to thrive through bleaching events, mainly in eutrophic environments, probably related to food availability.
