Changes in functional biodiversity in an invaded freshwater ecosystem: the Moselle River
The spread of non-indigenous species and the decline of autochthonous ones are leading to a homogenization of freshwater fauna in terms of systematic units, but the functional consequences are poorly documented. We studied the peculiar case of the lower, French section of the Moselle River where 20 invertebrate species have been introduced since 1854, with a rate increasing exponentially with time. Dredge sampling performed in 1994, 1996, 2000 and 2001 at four sampling stations allowed for an evaluation of faunal changes in terms of composition, structure and function. During this period, no structural changes were recorded in spite of multiple, new and successful introductions. The evaluation of functional modifications was based on a typology of taxa exhibiting homogeneous biological/ecological traits. Functional diversity, measured as the diversity of taxa distribution among functional groupings, revealed a significant increase between 1994/1996 and 2000/2001 because those species that were over-represented during the former period reached more equilibrated densities during the latter. The major, indirect implications of these functional changes are discussed.
