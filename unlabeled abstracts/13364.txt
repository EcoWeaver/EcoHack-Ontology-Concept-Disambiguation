The status of Lake Lanao endemic cyprinids (Puntius species) and their conservation
The endemic cyprinid species flock of Lake Lanao, Philippines is a classic example of explosive evolution. Based on historical surveys, most of the 18 endemic cyprinid species in Lake Lanao are now believed to be extinct. We compared results of landing and market surveys conducted in 2008 to information from historical surveys. Field sampling and fishermen interviews provided additional information on the status of the endemic and other fish species in Lake Lanao. Puntius lindog and Puntius tumba were the only two endemic species recorded in 2008, accounting for 0.01 % and 0.04 % respectively of the total weight harvested. Our discovery that at least two endemic cyprinids remain in Lake Lanao is surprising and significant as the lake is increasingly imperiled by human disturbances, exploitation and introduced species. Protecting and conserving the remaining endemic species are important management priorities.
