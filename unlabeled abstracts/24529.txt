Differential effects of native and invasive algal wrack on macrofaunal assemblages inhabiting exposed sandy beaches
Many sandy beaches worldwide receive large amounts of drift seaweed, known as wrack, from offshore algal beds and closer rocky intertidal shores. Despite the important influence of algal wrack on macrofaunal assemblages from different coastal systems, relatively little attention has been paid to the macrofaunal responses in sandy beaches to macrophyte wrack supplies. Algal wrack is a key resource, i.e. for food and/or refuge, for beach invertebrates while its availability can affect diversity and abundance of intertidal animals including shorebirds, but the role of certain types of wrack and its location on the shore has not been examined experimentally to date. In this paper, we use experimental manipulation of two species of brown seaweeds, i.e. artificial wrack patches made up of the native macroalgae Saccorhiza polyschides and the invasive species Sargassum muticum, to test hypotheses about influences on macrofaunal assemblages inhabiting the drift line and supratidal levels of exposed beaches. Results pointed out that different types of wrack deposits were not used uniformly by invertebrates. Nutritional value differed between the two species of wrack. In most cases, the carbohydrates, lipids and organic carbon content were greater in patches of S. muticum than in patches of S. polyschides. Data also provided evidences that nutritional content and microclimatic conditions of wrack deposits, i.e. temperature and humidity, might affect macrofaunal assemblages.
