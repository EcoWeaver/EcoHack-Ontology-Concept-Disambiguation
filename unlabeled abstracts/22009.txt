Early detection of marine invasive species, Bugula neritina (Bryozoa: Cheilostomatida), using species-specific primers and environmental DNA analysis in Korea
The bryozoan, Bugula neritina, is one of the most widespread sessile marine invasive species. Since its first discovery in Korea in 1978, the gradual increase in the distribution and abundance of this species resulted in a significant damage to growth of aquaculture. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a potentially useful tool for species detection including rare, invasive and threatened native species. In this study, species-specific primers and probe were designed to amplify a 185-bp region based on mitochondrial COI of B. neritina for monitoring, and tested on environmental samples from 35 harbors of Korea in 2017. Among 35 sites monitored, B. neritina colonies were detected in 27 sites during field survey. However, B. neritina DNA was detected in all examined eDNA isolated from seawater. These results suggested that eDNA-based methods coupled with simple seawater sampling could be suitable for determining the distribution and abundance of B. neritina as complementary traditional monitoring.
