Angling web forums as an additional tool for detection of new fish introductions: the first record ofPerca fluviatilisin continental Portugal
This work reports for the first time the presence of a non-native fish, the European Perch (Perca fluviatilis), in continental Portugal. The presence of this species was first reported on an angling web forum and its occur- rence was scientifically confirmed later in a small reservoir of the Tagus river basin, located in the central region of Portugal. The importance of the angling web forums as a useful tool to help detection of non-native fish species introductions and their potential for education on biological invasions is discussed.
