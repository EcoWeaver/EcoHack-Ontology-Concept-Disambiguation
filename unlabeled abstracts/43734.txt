In total, 22 taxa of Ponto-Caspian invertebrates were found in the benthos and periphyton of the Kanevskoe and Kievskoe reservoirs and in the cooling pond. The history of invasion and distribution of two Dreissena species in the cooling pond and also the features of their spatial and biotopic distribution in reservoirs are described. Information on the invasions of Dreissena polymorpha Pall, in the cooling pond of the Khmelnitskaya nuclear power plant is presented. invasions-Dreissena polymorpha-Dreissena bugensis-Ponto-Caspian species
