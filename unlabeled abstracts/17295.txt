Reproduction of the invasive bluespotted cornetfishFistularia commersonii(Teleostei, Fistulariidae) in the Mediterranean Sea
We investigated the reproduction of the bluespotted cornetfish Fistularia commersonii, one of the most successful invaders of the Mediterranean Sea and Europe. The results highlighted a multiple spawning pattern with asynchronous oocyte development and an unrestricted testicular organization with cystic spermatogenesis. Eight maturity stages in females and four in males were described. The reproductive season lasted at least six months, from May to October, with a peak in August, but gravid specimens were observed up to December. The gonadosomatic index and condition factors were significantly correlated with water temperature. Spawning started at an average water temperature of 228C. The species is reproductively adapted to the conditions occurring in the Mediterranean Sea and it is suggested that warming conditions could facilitate its success along the Northern and Western sectors of the basin.
