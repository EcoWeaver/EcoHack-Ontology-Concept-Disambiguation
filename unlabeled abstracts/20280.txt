Community structure of insect herbivores on introduced and native Solidago plants in Japan
We compared community composition, density, and species richness of herbivorous insects on the introduced plant Solidago altissima L. (Asteraceae) and the related native species Solidago virgaurea L. in Japan. We found large differences in community composition on the two Solidago species. Five hemipteran sap feeders were found only on S. altissima. Two of them, the aphid Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum Olive (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and the scale insect Parasaissetia nigra Nietner (Hemiptera: Coccidae), were exotic species, accounting for 62% of the total individuals on S. altissima. These exotic sap feeders mostly determined the difference of community composition on the two plant species. In contrast, the herbivore community on S. virgaurea consisted predominately of five native insects: two lepidopteran leaf chewers and three dipteran leaf miners. Overall species richness did not differ between the plants because the increased species richness of sap feeders was offset by the decreased richness of leaf chewers and leaf miners on S. altissima. The overall density of herbivorous insects was higher on S. altissima than on S. virgaurea, because of the high density of the two exotic sap feeding species on S. altissima. We discuss the importance of analyzing community composition in terms of feeding guilds of insect herbivores for understanding how communities of insect herbivores are organized on introduced plants in novel habitats.
