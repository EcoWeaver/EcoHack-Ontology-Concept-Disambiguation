Fronts from two-dimensional dispersal kernels: Beyond the nonoverlapping-generations model.
Most integrodifference models of biological invasions are based on the nonoverlapping-generations approximation. However, the effect of multiple reproduction events (overlapping generations) on the front speed can be very important (especially for species with a long life spam). Only in one-dimensional space has this approximation been relaxed previously, although almost all biological invasions take place in two dimensions. Here we present a model that takes into account the overlapping generations effect (or, more generally, the stage structure of the population), and we analyze the main differences with the corresponding nonoverlapping-generations results.
