Changes in the plant community of a Brazilian grassland savannah after 22 years of invasion byPinus elliottiiEngelm
Background: The invasion by Pinus elliottii is one of the most serious threats to the remaining native cerrado vegetation in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, causing biodiversity losses yet to be evaluated. We conducted a study in an area where P. elliottii began establishing in 1988.Aims: To estimate diversity losses in the plant community and to understand the floristic and structural changes resulting from pine tree invasion of grassland savannah.Methods: All plants taller than 50 cm were sampled in 35 plots (64 m each) within an area densely invaded by P. elliottii and in 10 plots in non-invaded grassland savannah. Density, species richness, diversity, ground cover and spatial distribution were compared by Wilcoxon tests, non-metric multidimensional scaling and Payandeh indices.Results: Twenty-two years after the arrival of the first invasive trees (founders), the grassland savannah has become a dense pine forest with 12,455 individuals ha, a basal area of 26.44 m ha, a sparse native woody understory comprised of 16 species (H' = 0.44), density of 1210 individuals ha and the herbaceous layer totally absent.Conclusions: Invasion by Pinus elliottii has completely changed the structure of the grassland savannah and caused severe plant diversity losses. Native species surviving the invasion in the understory do not typically represent the previous composition and functional traits of the native vegetation.
