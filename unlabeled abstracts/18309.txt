Control ofPseudophilothrips ichini(Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae) with acephate to exclude a biological control agent ofSchinus terebinthifolia
Post-release monitoring of biological control agents to determine impact on the target weed has recently received increased priority. Several methods are available to measure the impact of a biological control agent by manipulating the agent population while measuring fitness of the weed. Brazilian peppertree, Schinus terebinthifolia is one of the most damaging weeds in subtropical areas of Florida and Hawaii. A biological control agent, the thrips, Pseudophilothrips ichini is a sap-feeder that shows high levels of specificity and causes severe distortion of leaf tips of the weed. Thrips populations of this species and a generalist thrips, the red banded thrips Selenothrips rubrocinctus were experimentally manipulated by applications of the systemic insecticide acephate by both foliar applications and by an inserted encapsulated formulation. Foliar applications protected plants against red banded thrips for 29 days and against the biological control thrips, P. ichini for 22 days after treatment. Control with inserts were initially low but was achieved after 60 days and this control continued for 182 days after treatment. Manipulation of these biological control thrips populations with foliar or inserted formulations will assist in the determination of biological control agent impact.
