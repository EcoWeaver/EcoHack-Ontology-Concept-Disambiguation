Biological invasion at an early stage? First record of the banjo catfish Pseudobunocephalus iheringii (Siluriformes: Aspredinidae) in the Tramandai river basin, Brazil and the potential invasion pathway to this system.
The aim of this paper is to report the occurrence of Pseudobunocephalus iheringii (Boulenger 1891) in an artificial channel in the watershed divide between the Laguna dos Patos basin and the Tramandai river basin, in southern Brazil. This report represents the first record of an additional nonnative species in the Tramandai basin, documents the early stage of a potential invasion process in this system, and represents the first evidence for the role of artificial water channels as invasion pathways for nonnative fish species into the Tramandai basin, affecting two aquatic ecoregions (Laguna dos Patos and Tramandai-Mampituba) in souther Brazil.
