Does competition for pollinators contribute to structuringEricacommunities?
Pollinators are often implicated in the origin of plant species, but their role during the assembly of diverse plant communities has only rarely been investigated. Intra-specific competition for pollinators can theoretically facilitate plant species co-occurrence by limiting the density of any one species, while inter-specific competition can potentially structure communities through the exclusion of inferior competitors. We analyse plant community composition and use field experiments to test whether intra- and inter-specific competition for pollinators structures communities of co-occurring Erica species.
