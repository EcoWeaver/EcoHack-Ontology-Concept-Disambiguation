Factors affecting radial growth of the invasive Prunus serotina in pine plantations in Flanders
Prunus serotina is an invasive species that causes problems mainly in pine forests on sandy soils in Western Europe. Thus far, there have been almost no studies considering the diameter growth of P. serotina in its introduced range. We analysed the radial growth of P. serotina in seven Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) plantations in Flanders (Belgium) using multiple linear regression and a potentialxmodifier approach. The radial growth of P. serotina in the understory of the studied pine plantations was reduced by up to 50% when compared to potential P. serotina growth in full light conditions. Size and site effects were strongly growth-reducing; crowding effects were important only for small individuals. The actual radial growth of P. serotina below pines was determined primarily by the diameter and age of the P. serotina tree and by competition with neighbouring trees.
