A new report of Craspedacusta sowerbii (Lankester, 1880) in southern Chile
Craspedacusta sowerbii (Lankester, 1880) is a cnidarian thought to originate from the Yangtze River valley in China. However, C. sowerbii is now an invasive species in freshwater systems worldwide. In Chile, C. sowerbii was first recorded in 1942 by Porter and Schmitt in the Marga-Marga Reservoir, in Valparaiso. Since then, there have been few further Chilean records of this species. Here, we report the presence of C. sowerbii medusae in Santa Elena Lake, Bulnes, Region del Bio- Bio, along with limnological parameters.
