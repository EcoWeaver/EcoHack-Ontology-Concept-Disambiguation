Efficacy of high-pressure seawater spray against colonial tunicate fouling in mussel aquaculture: inter-annual variation
Invasive species such as ascidians have negative effects on aquaculture operations worldwide. Prince Edward Island, Canada, in particular has seen high fouling levels of non-native tunicates including the colonials Botryllus schlosseri and Botrylloides violaceus. Previous research indicated that high-pressure seawater spraying of mussel socks fouled with colonials is an effective mitigation strategy. Those results, however, were based on a year (2009) with unseasonably low water temperatures at the beginning of the colonial tunicate growing season in June and July; therefore, we repeated part of that study in the following year (2010) to determine whether typical (warm) early season water temperature affected tunicate fouling levels and how both treatment efficacy and fouling effect on mussel productivity differed between the two years. In 2010, Botryllus schlosseri fouling (in terms of biomass) was four-fold higher than in the colder year (2009), reaching an average biomass of 600-800 g per full-length mussel sock (up to 2.4 m long), but it still did not affect mussel productivity. B. violaceus was also present on mussel socks, but only in very low amounts (<50 g per mussel sock), so that results for this species were inconclusive. High-pressure water spraying was at least as effective in 2010 as in 2009 at removing B. schlosseri tunicate fouling from mussel socks, though in 2010, treatment also negatively affected mussel productivity by reducing mussel biomass by 30% in the frequently (5x) treated group. Considering these results along with the potential risk of increased tunicate spread (through fragmentation) and the cost of treatment, frequent application of high-pressure water spray is unnecessary.
