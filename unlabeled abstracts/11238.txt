Local-scale correlates of native and non-native earthworm distributions in juniper-encroached tallgrass prairie
European and Asian earthworms have invaded much of North America with profound impacts to soils, plant communities, and animal populations. However, few studies have assessed local-scale correlates of earthworm distributions, and most invasive earthworm research has occurred in northern forests. Additionally, despite several studies showing facilitative relationships between invasive earthworms and invasive plants, no research has assessed a potential facilitative interaction between earthworms and woody plants encroaching into prairies. We conducted the first assessment of factors influencing local-scale distributions of native and non-native earthworms for the U.S. Great Plains in a tallgrass prairie-woodland mosaic experiencing eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) encroachment. We documented both native and non-native earthworms, including non-native species from Eurasia (Aporrectodea spp.) and South America (Family Ocnerodrilidae). Native and non-native earthworm distributions were strongly correlated, yet local-scale predictors of distribution also differed between the groups. Native earthworms were more likely to occur near roads and in areas with moist soils. Contrary to expectation, we found no evidence that non-native earthworms occurred more frequently in areas with eastern redcedar-encroachment; instead, non-native earthworms were most likely to occur in tallgrass prairie. Our results suggest that, within prairies and woodlands of the Great Plains, native and non-native earthworms occur most frequently near roadways and in locations with moist soil. Because the few approaches for controlling invasive earthworms are only likely to be feasible on a small scale, findings from such local-scale studies are important for directing management to reduce earthworm impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services.
