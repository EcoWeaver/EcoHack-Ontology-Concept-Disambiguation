Invasive and nativeRhododendron ponticumpopulations: is there evidence for genotypic differences in germination and growth?
Previous studies have shown that the invasive spread of Rhododendron ponticum in the British Isles is influenced by the more favourable environmental conditions in the new territory than in the species' home range. In this study, we asked whether the species' invasion success might also involve a genotypic background for higher growth and germination rates in invasive populations. We tested the hypotheses that invasive populations have higher absolute germination rates, germinate faster and exhibit higher growth rates. We present data from greenhouse and climate chamber experiments with seed material and Rhododendron cuttings from six populations each of native Georgian, native Spanish and invasive Irish populations subjected to different temperature environments. There were no differences in the maximum germination rate and optimum germination temperature between native and invasive origins. We found significant differences in germination velocity with the Irish seeds responding most rapidly to all germination treatments. Accordingly, in the growth experiment the invasive Irish origins had the highest relative growth rates in all environments tested. Our results provide evidence for a genetic shift in invasive populations towards an increased investment in growth and towards a faster germination rate. Both traits would contribute to explaining this species' range expansion. The underlying evolutionary mechanisms for this shift are discussed, including the possibility of hybridisation or of an ecological release from hitherto experienced constraints in the native area.
