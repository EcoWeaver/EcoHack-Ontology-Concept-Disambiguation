Effects of exotic grass invasion on spatial heterogeneity in the ground-layer of grassy woodlands
We quantified the effects of exotic annual grass invasion on the ground-layer structure of grassy eucalypt woodlands, with the aim of determining if weed invasion decreased gap size and plant basal area leading to reduced spatial heterogeneity. We measured plant density, distance between plants and basal plant area in woodland sites which ranged from zero to 100% exotic plant cover in the ground-layer. The ground-layer in uninvaded woodlands was heterogeneous, with a large variation in basal plant area and distance between plants. Exotic annual grass density was positively correlated with total plant density, whereas native plant density was negatively correlated. Total plant basal area decreased as total plant density increased, with a lower total plant area in exotic dominated transects compared to native dominated. Variation in basal plant area decreased with increasing plant density. Exotic annual grasses were more closely spaced together (smaller gap size) and had a smaller basal area than the native grasses and rushes. There was also less variation in basal area and gap size with individual exotic annual grasses compared to the native grasses. Inter-plant distance was greater for both the native and exotic grasses when they had native grasses neighbouring them instead of exotic grasses. These findings show that woodlands invaded by exotic annual grasses have relatively less spatial heterogeneity in the ground-layer. These results have implications for other aspects of perennial grassy ecosystems invaded by annual grasses, including plant recruitment and restoration strategies.
