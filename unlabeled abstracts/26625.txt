Rotifer Population Dynamics in Two Coupled Habitats: Invasion of Chaos
We study the role of interactions between habitats in rotifer dynamics. We use a simple discrete-time model to simulate the interactions between neighboring habitats with different intrinsic dynamics. Being uncoupled, one habitat shows periodical oscillations of the rotifer biomass while the other one demonstrates chaotic oscillations. As a result of the exchange of rotifer biomass, chaos replaces regular oscillations. As a result, the rotifer dynamics becomes chaotic in both habitats. We show that the invasion of chaos is followed by the synchronization of the chaotic regimes of both habitats, and this synchronization increases as coupling between the habitats is increased. We also demonstrate that the biological invasion of the rotifer species, which show chaotic dynamics, to a neighboring habitat with intrinsically regular plankton dynamics leads to the invasion of chaos and the synchronization of chaotic oscillations of the plankton biomass in both the habitats.
