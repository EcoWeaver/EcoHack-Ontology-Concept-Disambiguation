The finding of North American freshwater gastropods of the genus Planorbella Haldeman, 1842 (Pulmonata: Planorbidae) in East Siberia
Specimens belonging to North American representatives of the genus Planorbella Haldeman, 1842 of the gastropod family Planorbidae were found for the first time living at the inlet of a warm stream running from the Ust-Ilimsk Pulp and Paper Plant into the Angara River along with the two common indigenous species Galba truncatula (Pulmonata: Lymnaeidae) and Sibirenauta sibirica (Pulmonata: Physidae). Morphological studies of the shell, the radula and the genitals showed that the newly found Planorbella specimens can most likely be attributed to P. duryi duryi (Wetherby, 1879) while it also contains morphological characters of other species in this genus. It is assumed that the occurrence of Planorbella in East Siberian water bodies is a result of unintentional release from aquarium tanks.
