Genome-wide analysis of the Fusarium oxysporum mimp family of MITEs and mobilization of both native and de novo created mimps.
We have performed a genome-wide analysis of the mimp family of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements, taking advantage of the recent release of the F. oxysporum genome sequence. Using different approaches, we detected 103 mimp elements, corresponding to 75 nonredundant copies, half of which are located on a single small chromosome. Phylogenetic analysis identified at least six subfamilies, all remarkably homogeneous in size and sequence. Based on high sequence identity in the terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), mimp elements were connected to different impala members. To gain insights into the mechanisms at the origin and amplification of mimps, we studied the potential of impala to cross-mobilize different mimps, native but also created de novo by inserting a short DNA segment between two TIRs. Our results show that TIR sequences are the main requirement for mobilization but that additional parameters in the internal region are likely to influence transposition efficiency. Finally, we show that integration site preference of native versus newly transposed mimps greatly varies in the host genomes used in this study.
