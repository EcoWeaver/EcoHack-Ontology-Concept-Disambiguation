Response to Comment on "Opposing Effects of Native and Exotic Herbivores on Plant Invasions"
Our investigation found that non-native plants were more susceptible to native generalist herbivores than were native plants. Ricciardi and Ward's finding that non-native plants without native congeners are more susceptible to native herbivores than are non-natives with coexisting native congeners supports our hypothesis that evolutionary naivete leaves plants at greater risk of attack by newly encountered generalist herbivores.
