Biological invasions in artificial habitats: factors that determine the presence of native and exotic peracarid Crustacea species in Southwestern Atlantic
The aims of this study were to compare the richness and the population traits of exotic and native peracarid species in two ports of the Southwestern Atlantic (Mar del Plata: MDP, Puerto Madryn: PMY), in order to discuss the vulnerability of these environments to biological invasions, to explore the current status of these assemblages and to study the life history traits that could favour the establishment of exotic species in these ports. Five biofouling samples were taken each season from 2016 to 2017. The present study showed that exotic species were dominants in both ports but profound differences were registered between environments: MDP port is characterized by the absence of native species and highest richness of exotic species (n = 7 spp.); while in PMY port two native species were registered and exotic species (n = 2 spp.) showed lower richness than MDP port. The analysis of species assemblages and life history traits allows us to discuss the potential invasive pattern of peracarids in the Southwestern Atlantic, suggesting that factors, such as propagule pressure, port infrastructure, pollution levels are closely related to the differences in vulnerability of these artificial environments to biological invasions. In addition, the population dynamics and the reproductive traits of exotic species could explain their establishment and proliferation in the marine environments studied.
