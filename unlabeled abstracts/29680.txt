Mozambique's charcoals--energetic properties of nine native species
Most of the charcoal produced commercially in Mozambique is from natural forest and its production often affects negatively the environment. Nine species of high commercial value were analyzed and the results indicate comparable quality of their charcoal and that made from species of low commercial value. The dissemination of this knowledge could relieve pressure on the valuable species and also help in controlling the charcoal supply chain.
