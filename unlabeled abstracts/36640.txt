The Future of Legislation, Policy, Risk Analysis, and Management of Non-Native Freshwater Fishes in China
Policies and legislation for the importation and use of non-native (NN) freshwater fishes have been rapidly evolving in several countries around the world in response to heightened evidence of their adverse ecological and economic impacts. In China, the already large and growing number of NN freshwater fishes being imported from foreign countries or translocated within China has necessitated the development of management strategies supported by policies at both national and regional levels. Despite increasing awareness of the damage caused by NN fishes, such initiatives in China continue to lag behind those already implemented in other countries. This study endeavours to narrow this policy gap by: (i) providing an synoptic overview of the vectors and pathways of NN freshwater fish introductions and dispersal both into and within China; (ii) evaluating existing policies and legislation relative to those currently implemented in Europe, the USA and Canada; (iii) examining the role of decision-support tools for identifying and assessing the risks posed by NN fishes; and (iv) proposing perspectives and possible options for NN fish policies, legislation and management in China.
