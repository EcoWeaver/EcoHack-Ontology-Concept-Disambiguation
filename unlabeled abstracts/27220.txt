The role of size-selective predation in the displacement of Orconectes crayfishes following rusty crayfish invasion
Selective predation can drive community composition. We designed a field study to determine if selective predation by fishes accounts for population dominance of the exotic rusty crayfish, Orconectes rusticus, in a northern Wisconsin lake. We hypothesized that fish predators avoid consuming O. rusticus in favor of congeners O. propinquus and O. virilis because O. rusticus attains either superior size or is more aggressive than its congeners. Largely based on previous experimental work, we expected that predators would consume smaller individuals of rusty crayfish than of other species, as a result of behavioral differences among crayfish species. Although smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) consumed fewer rusty crayfish than expected based on relative prey abundance, predators consumed similar sized crayfish of all species. Further, our results indicated that predators likely avoid O. rusticus because they have larger chelae than congeners, and that behavioral differences did not appear to contribute substantially to crayfish selection at the whole lake scale. Our results suggest that selective predation based on chelae size is one of the primary drivers of this species replacement. Selective predation commonly accelerates exotic dominance over native prey and should be considered explicitly in exotic species investigations.
