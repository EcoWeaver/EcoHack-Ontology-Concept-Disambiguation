Identification key for drosophilid species (Diptera, Drosophilidae) exotic to the Neotropical Region and occurring in Brazil
Thirteen exotic species of drosophilids are recorded in the Neotropical Region, and some of them are highly invasive and a significant threat to fruit cultures. We provide an illustrated key for identifying exotic drosophilid species in Brazil and briefly discuss their taxonomic status, distribution, and occurrence in the Neotropics. The key should support newcomers to the study of Drosophila and facilitate the identification of exotic drosophilids by illustrating their specificities.
