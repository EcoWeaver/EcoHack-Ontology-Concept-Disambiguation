A new species, Cheiloneurus nankingensissp. nov., from Eastern China is described. It is similar to C. arabiacus Hayat but distinct from it in a number of morphological characters. It is a hyperparasitoid with the encyrtid wasp Aenasius arizonensis Girault, 1915 as the primary host and the cotton mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley, 1898 (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) as the secondary host. A key to all seven species of Cheiloneurus known from China is presented.
