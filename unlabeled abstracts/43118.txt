The ecology of non-native invasive plant species: are there consistent patterns?
Abstract Non-native invasive species are defined as those naturalized species that are new to a particular region and produce reproductive offspring at considerable distance from their native land. Invasive plants can be introduced accidentally (e.g. Parthenium hysterophorus and Chromolaena odorata ) or deliberately (e.g. Lantana camara and Prosopis juliflora ) and can have profound population, community and ecosystem-level effects. The aim of this paper is to examine how ecological attributes such as disturbance, species diversity and species richness influence invasion patterns. Are there parameters that retrospectively explain a significant amount of variation in invasion outcome? How often do the same parameters correlate with invasion success or failure among different communities, and can these variables be implemented in general models that aim to predict the likelihood of plant invasions? We feel that the chances of detecting any broadly applicable relationship (i.e. general factors that governs habitat invasibility or invasive success) are remote given contemporary approaches to biological invasions. Our conclusion is based on the nature of complex dynamical systems, where generality is possible at some levels of organization and observation but not others. Precise prediction requires a case-by-case study, and even then the outcome of biological invasions can be surprising.
