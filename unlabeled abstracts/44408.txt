Application of Herbicides in the Control of the Invasive Species Heracleum sosnowskyi Manden. (Sosnowsky's Hogweed) in Forestry
A representative of the family Apiacea, Sosnowsky's hogweed ( Heracleum sosnowskyi Manden.) previously cultivated as a fodder plant and now occupying vast territories along roads and railways, in and near settlements, uncultivated agricultural lands, on farms and in many other areas, poses a serious threat to human health. On these lands, an active eradication campaign has been going on for over 15 years. This invasive species also spreads actively on the lands of the forest fund including plantations, felling sites, young stands of natural origin, clearings and hayfields, forest stands of different ages with a small basal area, and in the most productive forest conditions. As a result, in forest plantations growth of woody plants (primarily of coniferous species) is inhibited, their death is observed, and environmental, aesthetic and industrial damage increases due to the growth and dominance of Sosnowsky's hogweed. As a result of field experiments in the Leningrad Region, a high effectiveness of a number of modern herbicides (Roundup, Anchor-85, and Magnum) for control of Sosnowsky's hogweed and other unwanted herbaceous vegetation, as well as their selectivity in relation to pine and spruce, has been demonstrated.
