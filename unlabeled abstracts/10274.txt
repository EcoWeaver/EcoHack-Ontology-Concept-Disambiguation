Inbreeding depression and partitioning of genetic load in the invasive biennial Alliaria petiolata (Brassicaceae).
Unlabelled: * Premise of the study: Invasive species are nonnative species that enter novel environments, establish sustained populations, and can negatively impact native species. Here we assess a potential weakness of invasive species (genetic load) and show how species might overcome genetic barriers. Colonization of novel habitats by invasive species typically involves few individuals, exposing populations to founder effects. We empirically tested a central Illinois population of an invasive biennial plant, Alliaria petiolata, for evidence of a founder effect by assessing the pattern of genetic load. * Methods: To estimate genetic load, we assayed offspring from three cross types (self-pollinated, outcrossed within- and between-populations) in a greenhouse. Vegetative and reproductive traits were measured on first-year plants grown with or without intraspecific competition. * Key results: We found substantial genetic load in this population of A. petiolata, which can mostly be attributed to genetic drift (founder effect) and not inbreeding depression. Between-population heterosis was expressed more than inbreeding depression under intraspecific competition. * Conclusions: Inbreeding may be adaptive for A. petiolata in its introduced range by providing reproductive assurance, with limited inbreeding load. Nevertheless, most of the genetic load in this population of A. petiolata is due to fixation of deleterious alleles. Drift load is expected, given that this population is near the edge of its continuous geographic range in highly fragmented habitats, and gene flow between isolated populations is likely highly limited. Preventing additional introduction and movement of propagules between isolated local populations should reduce heterosis and A. petiolata competitiveness.
