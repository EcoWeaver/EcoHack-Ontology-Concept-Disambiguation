The potential role of waterbirds in dispersing invertebrates and plants in arid Australia
1. The role of waterbirds as vectors of plants and invertebrates within and between arid-zone wetlands is poorly understood. We present the first detailed study of passive dispersal by nomadic birds in Australasia. We investigated the numbers and types of invertebrate and plant propagules within freshly collected faecal samples as well as their viability. We compared dispersal among Grey Teal (Anas gracilis), Eurasian Coot (Fulica atra) and Black Swan (Cygnus atratus) in the Macquarie Marshes, a complex of temporary to semi-permanent wetlands in New South Wales.
