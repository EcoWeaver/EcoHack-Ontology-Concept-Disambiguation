Effects of Desiccation and Sediment Type on Early Regeneration of Plant Fragments of Three Species of Aquatic Macrophytes
We tested the effects of desiccation and type of sediment (clay or sand) on the regeneration of fragments of the apical shoots of three species of Hydrocharitaceae: Egeria najas, E. densa and Hydrilla verticillata. The shoots were left to dry on clay or sand from zero to four days, and were then returned to aquaria containing water. To approximate natural conditions, the aquaria containing clay had higher turbidity and nutrient (P and N) concentrations than did the aquaria with sand. All species dried faster on sand substrate, which led to lower regeneration (in terms of dry weight, length, sprout and root formation) in this treatment. H. verticillata fragments elongated faster than the other species, but E. najas was the most successful species (in terms of increase in dry weight) in the sand treatment. Our results indicate that the exotic H. verticillata has a competitive advantage, at least in its early stages of regeneration, over the other two, native species, especially in more eutrophic and turbid habitats; whereas E. najas fragments have a competitive advantage in less-turbid, oligotrophic and sand-dominated sites.
