Evidence for spider community resilience to invasion by non-native spiders
The negative impacts of non-native species are well documented; however, the ecological outcomes of invasions can vary widely. In order to determine the resilience of local communities to invasion by non-native spiders, we compared spider assemblages from areas with varying numbers of non-native spiders in California coastal sage scrub. Spiders were collected from pitfall traps over 2 years. Productive lowland coastal sites contained both the highest proportion of non-natives and the greatest number of spiders overall. We detected no negative associations between native and non-native spiders and therefore suggest that non-native spiders are not presently impacting local ground-dwelling spiders. Strong positive correlations between abundances of some natives and non-natives may be the result of similar habitat preferences or of facilitation between species. We propose that the effects of non-native species depend on resource availability and site productivity, which, in turn, affect community resilience. Our results support the contention that both invasibility and resilience are higher in diverse, highly linked communities with high resource availability rather than the classical view that species poor communities are more invasible.
