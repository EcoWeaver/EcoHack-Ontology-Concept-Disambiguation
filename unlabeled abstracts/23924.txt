The effects of dreissenid mussels on the survival and condition of burrowing mayflies (Hexagenia spp.) in western Lake Erie
Burrowing mayflies (Hexagenia limbata and H. rigida) are once again prominent members of the benthic community in western Lake Erie. However, this community is now dominated by dreissenid mussels. We conducted a laboratory experiment and field sampling to investigate whether survival and condition of Hexagenia were affected by the presence, density, and quality of dreissenid mussels. In a laboratory experiment, Hexagenia survival was higher in microcosms without dreissenid mussels. We also found Hexagenia density to be higher at field sites with low dreissenid density, suggesting that Hexagenia survival is higher in these areas as well. In microcosm treatments with low dreissenid density, Hexagenia survival was higher in treatments with live dreissenids than in treatments containing only dreissenid shells. These findings suggest that while dreissenid shells degrade the quality of soft sediments for Hexagenia, some of the negative effect is offset by the presence of live dreissenids. The positive effect of live dreissenids is likely due to additional food resources made available to Hexagenia by the filtering activity of dreissenids. Neither dreissenid density nor shell "type" (shells alone or live dreissenids in shells) had an effect on Hexagenia condition. Thus, the interactions between these dominant benthic invertebrates are complex. Recovery of Hexagenia populations in western Lake Erie is likely affected by both changing environmental conditions due to anthropogenic activities and the introduction of exotic species into the benthic community. The results are likely to be continued instability of the benthic food web and unpredictable consequences for human utilization of this ecosystem.
