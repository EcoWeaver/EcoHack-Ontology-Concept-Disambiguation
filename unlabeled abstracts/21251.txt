A literature analysis of freshwater invasive species research: are empiricists, theoreticians, and economists working together?
Cross-disciplinary empirical and economic research, bridged by theoretical modelling, are critical research approaches in the development of effective policy and management actions to prevent and control the negative consequences of species invasions. We conducted a literature analysis of freshwater invasive species research to determine the prevalence of integrated research approaches, gaps in the current knowledge base, and to suggest future research directions. A total of 848 papers were evaluated to discern the proportion containing empirical, economic, theoretical, or integrative research related to freshwater invasive species. In addition, we quantified the proportion of literature that contained life-history or economic information useful for model parameterization. Overall, we found a lack of studies that integrated ecological and economic theory and empirical experiments. The availability of data necessary to parameterize models was also limited. These deficiencies must be addressed in future research on freshwater invasive species in order to implement effective and holistic management solutions.
