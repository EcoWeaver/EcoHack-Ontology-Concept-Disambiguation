Global threat to agriculture from invasive species
Significance A key scientific and policy challenge relating to invasive species at the world level is to understand and predict which countries are most vulnerable to the threat of invasive species. We present an analysis of the threat from almost 1,300 agricultural invasive species to the world (124 countries). The analysis examines the global distribution of these species, international trade flows, and each country's main agricultural production crops, to determine potential invasion and impact of these invasive species. We found the most vulnerable countries to be from Sub-Saharan Africa, while those countries representing the greatest threat to the rest of the world (given the invasive species they already contain, and their trade patterns) to be the United States and China.
