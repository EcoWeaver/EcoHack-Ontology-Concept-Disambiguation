Alien fish, amphibian and reptile species in Romania and their invasive status: a review with new data
The paper presents a review of literature data, supplemented with original observations, on the presence, establishment, distribution and invasive status of alien fish, amphibian and reptile species in Romania. Consistent criteria were followed in defining alien species records, establishment and invasive status. From the 48 alien fish species, 1 fish hybrid, 1 amphibian and 18 reptile species recorded, only 16 fishes and 3 reptiles can be regarded as established. Of these we consider the criteria for invasive status as being probably fulfilled by one fish species (Perccottus glenii), and less likely by six more fish species. The presence and the alien status of the one amphibian are debatable. No reptile species can be considered invasive at present.
