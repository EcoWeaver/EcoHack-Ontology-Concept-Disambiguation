Effects of urban development and habitat alterations on the distribution and abundance of native and exotic freshwater fish in the Brisbane region, Queensland
Seventeen native and 6 exotic species were recorded in 55 creeks. Sixteen native and 4 exotic species were collected in a more restricted survey of central Brisbane. Native species with a preference for open water and beds of aquatic plants have declined in creeks overgrown by para grass Brachiaria mutica and floating plants. Melanotaenia fluviatilis, Retropinna semoni, Pseudomugil signifer, Craterocephalus stercusmuscarum and Ambassis nigripinnis have been affected. Para grass and floating plants have not affected the range or abundance of Hypseleotris galii, H. compressus and Mogurnda adspersa, Gambusia affinis and Xiphophorus helleri have been advantaged by expansion of their preferred habitat type - the edges of pools where exotic grasses have grown partly into the water. The effect of exotic fish on native species is unclear.- from Authors
