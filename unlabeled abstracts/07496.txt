Effects of the invasive clam Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774) on an estuarine microbial community
is well recognized for its in-vasive behavior and ecological impacts. * We tested the effects of C. fluminea on an microbial community. * The presence of living C. fluminea stimulated fungal biomass and bacterial diversity. * Bioturbation by C. fluminea is the potential main mechanism explaining our results. The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774) is well recognized for its invasive behavior and high ecological and economic impacts, being classified as one of the 100 worst invasive alien species (IAS) in Europe. In this study, we performed a manipulative experiment under natural conditions to assess the effects of C. fluminea on sediments biochemistry and on the structure of an estuarine microbial (fungi and bacteria) community. We placed 5 treatments (control, rock, closed, live and open) for 2 months in the Minho estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula). No differences were detected between treatments regarding the values of carbon (C), nitrite (NO 2 -), am-monium (NH 4 +), phosphate (PO 4 3-) and calcium (Ca) in the sediments; however, potassium (K) had higher values in the open treatment. Furthermore, we found that the presence of live C. fluminea stimulated fungal bio-mass (but not diversity) and bacterial diversity. Bioturbation activities by C. fluminea are possibly the main mechanism explaining these results; however, other factors such as the presence of other macroinvertebrate species and/or production of feces and pseudofeces by C. fluminea cannot be excluded. To our knowledge, this is the first manipulative experiment under natural conditions that clearly shows the effects of C. fluminea on an estua-rine microbial community. Given the widespread distribution of this IAS and the paucity of quantitative
