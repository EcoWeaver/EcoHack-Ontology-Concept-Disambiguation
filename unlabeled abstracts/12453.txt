The role of community composition in grassland response to two methods of exotic forb removal
Invasive plants can seriously threaten biodiversity and ecosystem function. Thus, controlling the abundance and mitigating the deleterious effects of invasive plants is imperative. The effectiveness of removal methods could vary based on potential damage to non-target species and on the ecological context of invasion. For example, species-poor communities might benefit disproportionately from invasive removal because they tend to be more heavily invaded than species-rich communities. In this study, we tested the efficacy of two common methods of invasive plant control, hand removal and 2,4-D herbicide application, against the invasive forb, Galium verum. We further tested whether the community response to G. verum removal varied across communities that differed in native grass richness (one, three or six species) and composition. Grass diversity did not interact with G. verum removal to influence any response. Instead, hand removal and herbicide application each reduced G. verum stem density by >50% relative to controls. Furthermore, hand removal of G. verum increased species richness by 25% relative to controls and herbicide-sprayed plots. Despite this benefit, hand removal is labour-intensive and impractical for large areas. These results also suggest that applying herbicide may control G. verum spread without substantially reducing forb diversity in invaded tallgrass prairie. Thus, herbicide application may be most suitable for grasslands with low native forb diversity, especially in managed grasslands and pastures where maintaining native forb diversity is a lower priority than maintaining high grass productivity.
