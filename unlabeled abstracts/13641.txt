Biomorphological features and microevolution of the invasive species Bidens L. in European Russia
Species of the genus Bidens that have invaded natural communities in Europe were observed. Fourteen species have been introduced in European botanical gardens since the 18th century, but only two of them have become invasive in Russia--Bidens frondosa and B. connata. B. frondosa demonstrates microevolutional ability in the second distribution range. Nevertheless, it has a low ability of hybridization. B. frondosa has higher competitiveness compared with that of B. connata.
