Registry of non-native species in the Two Seas region countries (Great Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands)
This dataset represents a registry of species that are not native but recorded to live in the wild of at least one of the four countries that comprise the Two Seas Area, i.e. Great Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. For each of the 6,661 species, subspecies and hybrids listed, we provide detailed information on its status in each country, taxonomic affiliation and environment inhabited. The data were collected by review of 36 web- and print-based sources over an eight-month period. Further systematic scanning of three of the most relevant scientific journals, i.e. Neobiota, Aquatic Invasions and BioInvasions Records, recovered 19 additional relevant publications from which information was included in the registry. As a result, the registry will serve as a basis for developing effective, cross-boundary strategies to manage and control non-native species, which can have severe ecological and economic impacts. The registry can further be used as a general reference for both scientists and practitioners, as well as a tool to assess reliability and comprehensiveness of other well-known databases such as the DAISIE portal.
