Constraints in range predictions of invasive plant species due to non-equilibrium distribution patterns: Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) in North America
Predicting distribution patterns of invasive species in regions outside of their native range is a fundamental component of early warning systems. The first aim of this study was to analyse some of the constraints and limitations concerning the applicability of results obtained from predictive, eco-geographical modelling methods. The next main objective was to evaluate the minimum monitoring-time requirements for reliable range predictions based on non-indigenous occurrences. This was achieved by comparing departures in 'model quality improvement' with 'elapsed time' after initial species establishment and subsequently increasing levels of data completeness.
