Isolation and characterization of microsatellite markers in the invasive shrub Mahonia aquifolium (Berberidaceae) and their applicability in related species
Microsatellite loci were isolated from a Mahonia aquifolium cultivar. We describe the variability of 10 loci in invasive European and native North American M. aquifolium and their transspecies amplification in native Mahonia repens and Mahonia pinnata from North America and one species of the related genus Berberis ( Berberis vulgaris ), native to Europe. The markers should be useful to reveal the genetic origin of invasive Mahonia populations and differences in the genetic make up between invasive and native populations.
