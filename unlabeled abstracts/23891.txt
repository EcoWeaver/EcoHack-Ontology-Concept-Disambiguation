A computer implementation of the partition of the unity procedure and its application to arthropod population dynamics. A case study on the European grape berry moth
This paper presents a new procedure to construct families of spatial approximation-prediction functions which depend on several parameters. The method is based on partitions of the unity. In order to find optimal functions in these families we introduce a Vietoris simplicial set associated to an influence radius. We consider error estimators induced by these Vietoris simplicial sets. A computational implementation of these mathematical models has been developed to be applied to any kind of finite discrete data. Our methods provide a useful tool for the analysis of the spatial distribution of species, which is imperative for developing accurate and efficient management of endangered and invasive species, biological conservation programs, etc. We demonstrate the application of our method to the analysis of the spatial distribution of the grape moth Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in the vineyards of La Rioja obtaining useful results for the management of this pest.
