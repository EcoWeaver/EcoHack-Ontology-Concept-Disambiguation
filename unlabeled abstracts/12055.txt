First records of marine invasive non-native Bryozoa in Norwegian coastal waters from Bergen to Trondheim
From 29 June to 25 July 2014, scientists from Heriot Watt University and the Natural History Museum, London, aboard the vessel MV Halton, undertook a research cruise along the Norwegian coast. The cruise started in Bergen and over the two-week period surveys were conducted at intervals along the coastline, heading northwards, and including the major ports of Alesund, Kristiansund, and Trondheim. When the vessel moored up in each harbour, surveys of the local pontoons were conducted to identify fouling species and to ascertain whether any non-native Bryozoa were present. Seven species of fouling Bryozoa were identified. Two of these were the non-native species Tricellaria inopinata d'Hondt and Occhipinti Ambrogi, 1985 and Schizoporella japonica Ortmann, 1890. This study represents the first confirmed records for these species from Norwegian coastal waters. It is likely, given the locations of occurrence, that small boat traffic was a vector for the introduction of these species. Recommendations are given for the amendment and addition of species to the Norwegian Black List.
