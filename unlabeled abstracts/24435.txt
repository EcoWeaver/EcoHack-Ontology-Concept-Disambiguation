A snail prefers native over exotic freshwater plants: implications for the enemy release hypotheses
Summary1. One of the most popular single-factor hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the naturalization and spread of introduced species is the enemy release hypothesis (ERH). Most studies have considered how specialist consumers might affect the success of exotics, but the importance of generalist herbivores has received little attention2. In this study, we compared the palatability of native and exotic freshwater plants in both phylogenetic pairings and in region-wide assays, using a generalist consumer (the pond snail Radix swinhoei).3. Our study indicated that, when plants were paired by taxonomic relatedness, the snail preferred native over exotic freshwater plants by a 2 : 1 ratio. The snail also preferred native over exotic plants when tested across 20 native and seven exotic species found growing in Liangzi Lake.4. Snails consumed more biomass of native than exotic plants, providing support for the ERH and suggesting that exotic species have a potential advantage in most lakes of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China, thus helping their invasion.
