Worldwide invasion of vector mosquitoes: present European distribution and challenges for Spain
An Asiatic mosquito species, Aedes albopictus, began to spread worldwide in the 1970s thanks to marine transport of tires and other goods, leading to colonization of many areas of the world. This species is a vector of major human diseases such as Dengue, Yellow Fever and the West Nile virus. In Europe, it was established in Albania and Italy and has been detected in other countries such as France; no records exist for Spain as yet. Colonization by Aedes albopictus is a major public health concern considering that the West Nile virus and several other viruses are known to circulate sporadically in the Mediterranean. Additionally, the parent species Aedes aegypti was the vector causing severe outbreaks of Dengue and Yellow Fever two centuries ago. Although Ae. aegypti was also introduced, it was eradicated from Spain. Both mosquitoes shared habitat types, diseases transmitted and many bionomic data. This article contains a review of the present Ae. albopictus distribution range worldwide and discusses the likelihood of an establishment in Spain in view of climatological and geographical data.
