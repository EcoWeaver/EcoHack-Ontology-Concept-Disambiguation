First trial of production of a native cichlid Herichthys cyanoguttatus comparison with the tilapia Oreochromis niloticus in aquaculture
Native species, in comparison to exotic species in aquaculture, such as tilapias, are an alternative with a lower risk to regional biodiversity, due to competition for resources caused by introduced species. Productivity, length-weight relationship and relative condition factor of a native cichlid Herichthys cyanoguttatus were investigated in comparison to tilapia Oreochromis niloticus. Fish with a wet weight of 0.54 +/- 0.07 g were placed in 100 L tanks inside a polyethylene greenhouse during 84 days. Wet weight (g) was obtained each week and standard length once per month. Both species had a high survival rate with a relative condition factor close to 1, showing a length-weight relationship with an isometric growth, meaning that they were in good condition. A significant difference was found in growth (P < 0.05) from the second week, with a specific growth rate of 2.28 +/- 0.07% day(-1) for tilapia and 1.35 +/- 0.02% day(-1) for the native cichlid, tilapia reached twice the total weight gain than the native cichlid (31.26 +/- 0.95 g; 83.70 +/- 4.54 g). Food conversion rate was higher in tilapia than in H. cyanoguttatus. The survival rate of H. cyanoguttatus, as well as the relationship of isometric growth and condition factor of both species, suggests that H. cyanoguttatus has the ability to grow in aquaculture systems.
