Evolution of introduced Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in Lake Huron: emergence of population genetic structure in less than 10 generations
Population genetic structure was detected in Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in their non-native range of Lake Huron using microsatellite DNA. All Chinook salmon in this system descend from Green River, Washington cohorts, originally transplanted to Michigan hatcheries in the late 1960s. We tested for population genetic differentiation of age 0 fish collected from 13 rivers and two hatcheries in 2007. The amount of genetic differentiation among collection sites was low but statistically significant, with FST values ranging from 0.036 to 0.133 and RST values ranging from 0.008 to 0.157 for specific loci. Based on pairwise FST and RST values and Bayesian cluster analysis, the Maitland River population in the Main Basin of Lake Huron was genetically distinct from the remaining collection sites. Based on analysis of bycatch data from commercial gill net fisheries, Chinook salmon likely colonised the Main Basin by 1975 (10 generations ago) and the North Channel and southern Georgian Bay regions by 1980 (eight generations ago). Thus, population genetic structure has emerged in Lake Huron Chinook salmon in <10 generations.
