Twelve invasive plant taxa in US western riparian ecosystems
Assessments,of stream,ecosystems,often include,an evaluation,of riparian,condition; a key stressor in riparian ecosystems,is the presence,of invasive plants. We analyzed,the distribution of 12 invasive taxa (common burdock [Arctium minus], giant reed [Arundo donax], cheatgrass [Bromus tectorum], musk thistle [Carduus nutans], Canada thistle [Cirsium arvense], teasel [Dipsacus fullonum], Russian olive [Elaeagnus angustifolia], leafy spurge [Euphorbia esula], English ivy [Hedera helix], reed canarygrass [Phalaris arundinacea], Himalayan blackberry [Rubus armeniacus], and saltcedar [Tamarix spp.]) to characterize a portion of that stressor. Observations,from,961 probability survey,reaches and 355 additional reaches distributed across 12 western US states provided a statistically defensible foundation for trend monitoring, risk assessments, or economic,evaluation,of these 12 taxa over a large area. We estimate,that  1 of these taxa are present in riparian areas on 47 6 3.6% of the perennial stream,length in the western,US. One or more,of these taxa were present in ., 3 of the reaches identified as least-disturbed (reaches that define reference condition,and,are used to quantify,instream,biotic integrity). Association between,target invasive presence,and instream,biotic integrity varied, particularly as a function of ecoregion. Relationships were often statistically significant in the Mountain climatic region, sometimes significant in the Xeric climatic region, and never significant in the Plains climatic region. Regional variations in associations and,confounding,relationships between,multiple factors suggest,that multiple,variables should,be examined,to explain or predict the presence,of invasive species or their associations. Our survey,illustrates strengths and,limitations of collecting information,on a limited number,of invasive,plants in riparian vegetation,as part of general probability surveys,of aquatic ecosystems. Our survey,of only 12 somewhat,arbitrarily selected invasive plants provided,much,information for a limited cost. We recommend,including,similar efforts in future surveys. Key words: invasive plants, riparian ecosystem, biotic integrity, reference condition, disturbance. Riparian ecosystems,exercise strong,controls over
