The use of potential distribution models in the study of the distribution and conservation status of plants: The case ofPlantagoL. (Plantaginaceae) in Brazil1
This work reviews the distribution and the conservation status of the 12 species of Plantago (Plantaginaceae) native to Brazil and presents potential distribution models for 8 of these species. The modeling procedure was carried out with a new online system dedicated to increase the biogeographic knowledge about plants and fungi in Brazil using different modeling strategies, depending on the number of points available. The models reflected reasonably well the known distribution of each species and can be used for conservation purposes, with the exception of one model for P. brasiliensis. The same points selected for model creation were also used to estimate the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy of these species in Brazil. According to the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) criteria, six species qualified as being of least concern, one as near threatened, three as endangered, and two as critically endangered. Also, six species of Plantago are exclusive to Brazil (P. catharinea, P. corvensis, P. guilleminiana, P. rahniana, P. trinitatis, and P. turficola), and four threatened species (P. commersoniana, P. corvensis, P. rahniana, and P. trinitatis) are absent or inadequately classified in the "Red List of the Flora of Brazil." Three nonnative species of Plantago occur in Brazil, all originating from Europe: P. coronopus, P. lanceolata, and P. major.
