First record of the Atlantic gammaridean amphipod Melita nitida Smith, 1873 (Crustacea) from German waters (Kiel Canal)
The amphipod Melita nitida Smith, 1873 is indigenous to the Atlantic coast of North America and so far has only been recorded as non-native species from the Pacific coast of North America and estuarine waters in The Netherlands. We detected a few specimens in the mesohaline part of the Kiel Canal (Germany) which showed considerable variation of some morphological characters. Transport in ballast water and in fouling on ships hulls seem to be the most likely introduction vector. A successful establishment of new populations of M. nitida in the Kiel Canal, other German estuaries or even the Baltic Sea cannot be excluded.
