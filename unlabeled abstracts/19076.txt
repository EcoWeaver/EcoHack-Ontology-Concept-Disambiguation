Another call for the end of invasion biology
The restriction of invasion biology to non-native species has been laid down as one founding principle of the discipline by many researchers. However, this split between native and non-native species is highly controversial. Using a phenomenological approach and a more pragmatic examination of biological invasions, the present paper discusses how this dichotomy has restricted the relevance of the field, both from theoretical and practical viewpoints. We advocate the emergence of a broader disciplinary field.
