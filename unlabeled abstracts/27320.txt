Invertebrate conservation in urban areas: Ants in the Brazilian Cerrado
We evaluated the potential of different types of urban green spaces for conservation of ground-dwelling ants. The study area, which included 12 public squares, two urban parks, and three natural reserves, is within the highly threatened Cerrado biome of central Brazil. We compared ant species richness and composition among the different types of urban green spaces, and evaluated how ant communities are affected by the structural characteristics of these spaces. The results indicate that public squares in commercial areas presented the least conservation value given the predominance of exotic ant species (mostly Pheidole megacephala). Public squares in residential areas ranked second, given the relative scarcity of exotic species and the greater richness of native species in these locations compared to those in more urbanized areas. The greatest conservation value was achieved by urban parks, which supported the greatest number of native species and were apparently free of exotic species. The closer proximity of urban parks to other natural areas and the presence of native vegetation within the boundaries of those parks appear to be key characteristics for the existence and maintenance of a relatively diverse ant fauna.
