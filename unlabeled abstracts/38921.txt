First record of the invasive species Ianiropsis serricaudis Gurjanova, 1936 (Crustacea: Isopoda) in Arcachon Bay, Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic)
The invasive isopod Ianiropsis serricaudis Gurjanova, 1936, originally described from the North-West Pacific Ocean, is herein reported for the first time on the French Atlantic coast. Its presence is probably due to oyster import activity, and the sampling of many brooding females in Arcachon Bay since 2013 suggests a well-established species. Its current European distribution is summarised and some morphological characters are discussed.
