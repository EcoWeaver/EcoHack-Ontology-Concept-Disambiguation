Evaluation of a biocoagulant from devilfish invasive species for the removal of contaminants in ceramic industry wastewater
AbstractThis study evaluated the effectiveness of a biocoagulant produced from the devilfish invasive species and its combination with two chemical coagulants (aluminum sulfate and ferric sulfate) to remove turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, and total suspended solids in ceramic industry wastewater using a combined experimental design of Mixture-Process. This design optimized the coagulation process and evaluated the effects and interactions between mixture components and coagulant doses. An analysis of variance was used to analyze the experimental data obtained in the study, and the response surface plots by response type (turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, and total suspended solids) were obtained. Results showed that the coagulation treatment could be technically and economically feasible since efficiencies of turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, and total suspended solids removal of 74, 79, and 94% could be achieved using an optimal coagulant dose of 800 mg/L with a mixture of 35% biocoagulant and 65% ferric sulfate. Analysis of variance results showed that the models are significant, and the lack of fit is not required according to the probability value (pvalue), which were < 0.0001, and > 0.05, respectively. Hence, the experimental data were fitted to a combined reduced special cubic x linear model. These results support the use of devilfish meal as a biocoagulant, being more feasible in dual systems when mixed with ferric sulfate.
