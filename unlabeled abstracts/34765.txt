Chlorophyll a fluorescence and transcriptome reveal the toxicological effects of bisphenol A on an invasive cyanobacterium, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii
Bisphenol A has attracted worldwide attention due to its harmful effects on humans, animals and plants. In this study, the toxicological effects of BPA on Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii were assessed based on chlorophyll a fluorescence and transcriptome analyses. The results showed that the growth of C. raciborskii was significantly inhibited when BPA exceeded 0.1 mg L -1. A marked rise of phase J was observed at a concentration greater than 0.1 mg L -1 , while a K phase appeared at 20 mg L -1. The chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters of RC/CS 0 , F 0 , ph P0 , ph E0 , and ps 0 , underwent a significant decline under all treatments of BPA, whereas a significant increase in both V J and M 0 occurred under all concentrations of BPA. Additionally, ABS/RC and DIo/RC markedly increased at 10 mg L -1 and 20 mg L -1. The transcriptome analysis revealed that the genes of photosynthesis, including psbA, psbB, psbC, psbD, apcA, apcB, cpcA, and cpcB, as well as those of chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis, namely hemN, acsF, chlL, chlN, chlP, crtB, pds, were all down-regulated. Moreover, BPA also inhibited the oxi-dative phosphorylation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), and fatty acid metabolism in C. raciborskii. Taken together, these results suggest BPA can negatively affect the expression of multiple genes and the vital energy metabolism process to arrest the growth and photosynthesis of C. raciborskii.
