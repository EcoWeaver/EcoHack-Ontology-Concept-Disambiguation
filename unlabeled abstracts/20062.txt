Predictors of invasion success by Daphnia species: influence of food, temperature and species identity
Non-indigenous North American Daphnia 'pulex' has recently invaded lakes and reservoirs in South Island, New Zealand, that formerly contained only native Daphnia carinata. New Zealand is characterised by a wide range of freshwater ecosystems and low species diversity of planktonic crustaceans, particularly Cladocera. The potential success of a species to invade and establish in a new community is likely to be predicted more accurately when reproductive response norms and fitness of key resident species, as well as the non-indigenous species, have been established under a range of relevant environmental conditions. Based on the results of experiments to test aspects of reproduction and fitness of the invader, D. 'pulex', and D. carinata when grown together at a range of relevant temperatures (8-23 degC) and related photoperiods, I predict the species-specific potential of D. 'pulex' to be dispersed and colonise New Zealand lentic habitats, and the potential of D. carinata to persist with the invader in these habitats. Larger population densities of D. 'pulex' compared to D. carinata at higher temperatures and food level, and larger densities of D. carinata at low temperatures, imply a potential for both species to coexist in New Zealand lakes, facilitated by seasonal succession; increased water temperature and nutrient input associated with climate and land use changes appear likely to promote the wider establishment of D. 'pulex', with both negative and positive implications for the conservation and management of New Zealand's freshwater ecosystems.
