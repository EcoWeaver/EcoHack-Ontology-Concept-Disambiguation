Undergoing invasion of the fangtooth moray, Enchelycore anatina (Lowe, 1838) in the Adriatic Sea - evidence of post spawning reproduction stage
The tropical Atlantic fangtooth moray Enchelycore anatina (Lowe, 1838) (Muraenidae) has naturally extended its range into the Mediterranean in the last decades. The record of a third specimen of the fangtooth moray, in the coastal waters of southeast Adriatic Sea, results in listing the species as established in the Adriatic Sea. The caught specimen was male with gonads in post spawning stage, indicating successful maturation and possible reproduction of the species in these waters.
