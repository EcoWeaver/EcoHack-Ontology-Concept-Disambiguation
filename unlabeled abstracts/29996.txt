The Biology of Invasive Alien Plants in Canada. 5. Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. & Zucc. [= Fallopia japonica (Houtt.) Ronse Decr.]
Polygonum cuspidatum (Japanese knotweed) is an introduced perennial geophyte in the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae). Much controversy has ensued over the taxonomic placement of this species, but following current evidence and common North American placement, we use Polygonum versus the subgenus Fallopia or Reynoutria. This species is most pernicious along riparian corridors and road and railroad rights-of-way; reducing visibility, displacing native species, and causing alterations in natural hydrologic processes. Although non-hybrid seed recruitment is impossible in Europe due to the presence only male-sterile clones, seeds and stem and rhizome fragments are dispersed via moving water bodies with subsequent population establishment in North America. Hybridization is common with the congeneric P. sachalinense in the introduced ranges of Europe and North America, producing the equally noxious P. x bohemicum
