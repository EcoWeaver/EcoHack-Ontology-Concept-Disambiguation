Review and new records of non-indigenous freshwater invertebrates in the Ebro River basin (Northeast Spain)
This paper is the first attempt to compile a list of the non-indigenous aquatic invertebrate species currently known to occur in the Ebro River basin (Northeast Spain). A total of 23 exotic aquatic species have been recorded in this area, and one more (the branchiobdellida Xironogiton victoriensis) may also be present in this Iberian basin. Due to the negative impacts that biological invasions cause to ecosystems and to human activities, it is important to state the introduction pathways and prevent the spread of already introduced species. In order to fight against biological alien species invasions, development of national strategies on invasive alien species and international cooperation are considered essential.
