On the effects of migration and spatial heterogeneity on single and multiple species
We first investigate in a logistic model the effects of migration and spatial heterogeneity of the environment on the total population size at equilibrium of a single species. Our study shows that (i) the total population size is maximized at some intermediate migration rate, and hence is a non-monotone function of the migration rate; (ii) heterogeneity of the environment increases the population size. In the second part of this paper, these findings are applied to ecological invasions. For a two-species Lotka-Volterra competition model with migration, we show that (i) without migration, the invading species eliminates the resident species at every point of the habitat, whereas when migration is present, for certain ranges of migration rates the invader may be eliminated when it is rare; and (ii) without migration, the two species can coexist at every point of the habitat, whereas when migration is present, for some ranges of migration rates one of the species is extinguished for all initial conditions.
