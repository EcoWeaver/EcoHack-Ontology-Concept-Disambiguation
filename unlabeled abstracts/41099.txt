Severe damage to vegetables by the invasive brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), in Hungary
Background and purpose: The brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys, is native to East Asia and has recently become an invasive pest in North America and Europe. It is considered a nuisance pest as well as a significant economic pest causing damage to a wide range of crops. Following its first record in Budapest, Hungary, in 2013, repeated reports confirmed its establishment in the country. In late summer 2016, growers began to complain about stink bug damage to dry bean and forced green hot pepper, both grown in the vicinity of a site in Budapest where BMSB had been present for at least the past three years. The aims of our study were to identify if the damage in green hot pepper and dry bean has been caused by BMSB and to estimate the level of the damage. Materials and methods: We collected 50 dry bean pods ('Etna') randomly from a 0.1 ha large plot on 2 September, and we checked the seeds in each pod for the symptoms of feeding in the laboratory. To assess the rate of damaged hybrid green hot pepper ('Daras') fruits, 100 fruits picked by the grower in a greenhouse were studied in situ on 8 September for damage from stink bugs. A vacuum device was used to collect stink bug samples from both sites. Results: We found damaged seeds in 47 dry bean pods (94%), and all the green hot pepper fruits (100%) were affected. We identified BMSB as the causal organism in both cases. Conclusions: Our results call the attention to the severe threat posed by BMSB to the European crop production.
