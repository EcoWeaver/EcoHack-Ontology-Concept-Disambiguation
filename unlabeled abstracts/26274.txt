Ecological change in Great Lakes communities -- a matter of perspective
Enormous change in food webs of the Laurentian Great Lakes has been documented from the early 1970s to the 1990s. Variation in abundances of species at all levels in these food webs has been attributed to a variety of causes, including nutrient abatement, invasive species, fishing practices, and climate change. However, this impression of great change is not obvious if food webs are examined from the different perspective of the biomass size spectrum. Despite large shifts in the species structure of zooplankton communities in Lakes Erie and Ontario from 1991 to 1997, zooplankton size spectra have not changed. Furthermore, size spectra for complete food webs of Lake Ontario (Laurentian Great Lake) and Lake Malawi (African Rift Valley Lake) are statistically indistinguishable despite enormous contrast in the geological age and fauna of the two lakes. I conclude that constraints on bioenergetic rate processes and physiological and ecological similarities of like-sized organisms at various hierarchical levels of organization lead to regular and repeatedly observed emergent properties of aquatic ecosystems that are independent of specific species.
