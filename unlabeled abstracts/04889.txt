Effect of prolonged exposition to pulp mill effluents on the invasive aquatic plant Egeria densa and other primary producers: a mesocosm approach
The recent disappearance of the aquatic plant Egeria densa, a Brazilian native invasive species, from a wetland in southern Chile prompted several efforts to unveil the origin of this phenomenon. Because these changes occurred by the time a newly built pulp mill started its operations in the area, a reasonable doubt for a cause-effect relationship is plausible. We implemented a mesocosm approach to directly evaluate the effect of treated pulp mill effluents (PMEs) on several growth-related parameters of E. densa as well as other primary producers. We hypothesize that effluent, at a dilution similar to that detected in the zone of the wetland where the negative environmental impacts were evident, has a significant negative effect on this aquatic plant as well as on other primary producers inside a mesocosm system. After a prolonged (months) exposure to both 0% PME with pure river water and a 4 to 5% (v/v) dilution of treated PME, no effect on E. densa was measured. Furthermore, plants exposed to effluent exhibited a significantly greater general growth rate. Coincidently, chlorophyll a concentration in the water column and periphyton biomass also changed over time, but without any pattern attributable to the effluent. Values of the autotrophic index obtained from the periphyton growth pattern did not suggest enrichment of the system with organic matter. Our results only refer to the direct effect of mill effluents on several biotic responses, but they represent an important advance toward generation of the scientific knowledge necessary to understand how the ecosystem functions while receiving this and other unquantified sources of water.
