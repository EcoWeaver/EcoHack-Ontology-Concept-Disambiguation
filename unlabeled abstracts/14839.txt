The imbalance of nature: revisiting a Darwinian framework for invasion biology
A major implication of natural selection is that species from different parts of the world will vary in their efficiency in converting resources into offspring for a given type of environment. This insight, articulated by Darwin, is usually overlooked in more recent studies of invasion biology that are often based on the more modern Eltonian perspective of imbalanced ecosystems. We formulate a renewed Darwinian framework for invasion biology, the evolutionary imbalance hypothesis (EIH), based only on the action of natural selection in historically isolated populations operating within a global network of repeated environments. This framework predicts that successful invaders are more likely to come from biotic regions of high genetic potential (with independent lineages of large population size), experiencing a given environment for many generations and under strong competition from other lineages.
