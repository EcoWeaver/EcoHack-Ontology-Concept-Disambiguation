Galanos Ch. J.: The alien flora of terrestrial and marine ecosystems of Rodos island (SE Aegean), Greece. -- Willdenowia 45: 261-278. 2015. -- Version of record first published online on 20 July 2015 ahead of inclusion in August 2015 issue; ISSN 1868-6397; (c) 2015 BGBM Berlin. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3372/wi.45.45211 The alien flora of the Greek island of Rodos (SE Aegean) is presented. This study is based on fieldwork carried out by the author up to June 2015, as well as on the literature found to date. The present checklist consists of 101 alien taxa of vascular plants, of which 27 are recorded for the first time as new for the alien flora of Rodos. Of these, 14 are also new for the alien flora of Greece. Of these, seven are naturalized: Austrocylindropuntia subulata, Erythrina lysistemon, Ficus microcarpa, Myoporum tenuifolium, Senecio angulatus, Washingtonia filifera and Yucca gloriosa; and seven are casual: Bauhinia variegata, Brachychiton populneus, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, Jacaranda mimosifolia, Pittosporum tobira, Thevetia peruviana and Phymosia umbellata. The last taxon is also recorded as a new for the alien flora of Europe. In addition, 13 alien taxa of marine algae are recorded. Each taxon is listed with its status (naturalized or casual, neophyte or archaeophyte), as well as its geographical origin. For each of the 27 taxa recorded as new for Rodos, localities and dates of field observations are provided, as well as a voucher specimen and at least one voucher photograph for each taxon. The modes of introduction of alien taxa to Rodos and their modes of dispersal within the island, as well as the invasion success and effects of invasive alien taxa, are discussed. The numbers of alien taxa in Rodos and other areas in the Mediterranean region are compared.
