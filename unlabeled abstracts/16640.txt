Increased compensatory ability of an invasive plant to above- and below-ground enemies in monocultures
Above- and below-ground enemies have prominent influence on plant invasions, and increasing evidence has shown that plant invasions are also affected by inter- or intraspecific interactions between individual plants. However, how these two factors interactively affect plant invasions has rarely been tested. Here, we examined the response of the invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb. to above- and below-ground enemies at varying plant densities in a greenhouse experiment in Wuhan, China. We found that both above- and below-ground enemies decreased the plant total and root mass at individual and population levels, but that of the two, below-ground enemies had a greater effect than above-ground enemies, and that the two guilds of enemies acted additively on the plant. However, their impacts decreased as the plant density increased, due to enhanced plant tolerance to both guilds of enemies. The increased plant tolerance may result from changes in plant resource allocation patterns, corresponding to a positive linear relationship between the ratio of fine root mass to total root mass and plant density. Given that forming dense monocultures in their new ranges is one of the most important characteristics of invasive plants, we propose that the high compensatory ability at dense monocultures may be an important mechanism underlying exotic species invasion.
