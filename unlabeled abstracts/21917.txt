Influences of herbicides, uprooting and use as cut flowers on sexual reproduction ofSolidago canadensis
Solidago canadensis is a noxious invasive species in China. We examined the influences of herbicides on pollen germination and pollen tube growth and the effects of cutting flowers and herbicides on seed production and quality. We also determined the seed production and resource allocation to different organs of S. canadensis after uprooting the plants during their reproductive periods. The main results were as follows: (i) 49% pollen of S. canadensis was able to germinate on an appropriate medium; (ii) compared with paraquat, ethephon and 2,4-D, glyphosate had an ideal inhibitory effect on pollen germination and the formation of seeds of S. canadensis; (3) cut flowering branches, when placed in water or nutrient solution, were still able to produce viable seeds; (4) resources were allocated more to the inflorescences to facilitate seed maturation after plants were uprooted at the flowering stage. Uprooted flower branches were still able to produce viable seeds, especially those in full flower. Therefore, in order to reduce the seed production of S. canadensis and spread of the species we suggest: (i) apply glyphosate at the flower bud stage, (ii) completely destroy uprooted plants at flowering stages and (iii) avoid using the flowering branches as ornamental materials.
