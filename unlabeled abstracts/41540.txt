Grassland invasions: effects of manipulations of climate and management
Successful colonization of B. pinnatum at Buxton, at the northern edge of its range in Britain, suggests that lack of dispersal is currently preventing its northward extension. On first inspection, the causes of distributional limits of B. pinnatum appear to be similar to those restricting the northward extensions of populations of Cirsium acaule; the two species occur in similar habitats and their geographical distributions coincide. Work by Pigott (1968) demonstrated that C. acaule was restricted at its northern outposts by limitations on seed production and dispersal. When these barriers are overcome, however, C. acaule appears to be fully capable of local persistence and consolidation by rhizome expansion. This conclusion is supported by the observation that isolated populations of some antiquity of both species are known to occur in north Derbyshire (Clapham 1969). There is no doubt that extensive rhizome expansion has been responsible for the spread of B. pinnatum at Buxton. However, the potential for further spread of B. pinnatum by seed dispersal cannot be discounted. Seed production by B. pinnatum at Buxton was examined in 1999 and 2000 and it was found to be producing large numbers of viable seed. Consequently, further research is required to examine whether the failure of existing north Derbyshire populations of B. pinnatum to spread is due to climate or self-incompatibility. Work by Schlapfer & Fischer (1998) on natural populations of B. pinnatum suggest a very low ratio of sexual vs. vegetative recruitment, notwithstanding their detection of high clonal diversity.
