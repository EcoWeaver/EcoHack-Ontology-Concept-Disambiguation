The effects of extreme forest fragmentation on the bird community of Singapore Island
Singapore Island suffered one of the highest known deforestation rates in the tropics from the mid-to-late 19th century when over 95% of its native lowland forest was cleared. We compared the current bird community structure and composition among three habitat types, i.e., old (>50 years, 7-935 ha) and young (50 years, 29-49 ha) naturally regenerating secondary forests and abandoned wooded plantations (27-102 ha) dominated by exotic species. Forest patch area had the strongest influence on the current species richness. The overall bird richness was not greater in most mature forest patches, but 20 species were only found in the old secondary forests and five of these were found in <50% of these patches. The rapid decrease in the number of forest species in plantations was offset by an increase in the number of open habitat species. Comparisons with current bird communities in nearby mainland forest sites (Peninsular Malaysia) suggest that the forest avifauna of Singapore is depauperate. The preservation of larger mature and maturing forests is therefore required for conserving the extant forest avifauna in Singapore. Connecting isolated patches can also be envisioned to facilitate movements of forest birds that have low densities and restricted distribution.
