Social Learning as an Approach to Environmental Education: Lessons from a program focusing on non-indigenous, invasive species
We used a social learning framework to evaluate the results of an extension education program focusing on non-indigenous, invasive species (NIS) in New York State. Sixteen teams of professional staff and volunteers from Cornell Cooperative Extension (CCE), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and a land trust participated in a 2-day NIS workshop, following which they worked with local government agencies, schools, industry, and non-profit groups to implement 15 education and 7 management programs. Developing collaborative programs that address local needs is an important aspect of social learning and learning communities in extension education. However, the program lacked other elements of social learning, e.g. educators evaluating and sharing the results of their local efforts. The potential for using social learning theory, which previously has been applied to sustainable agriculture and natural resources management, in environmental education may be viewed in light of motivating factors, benefits, and challenges for participants.
