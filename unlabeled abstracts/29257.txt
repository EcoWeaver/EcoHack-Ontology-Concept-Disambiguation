The Ponto-Caspian 'killer shrimp', Dikerogammarus villosus (Sowinsky, 1894), invades the British Isles
The Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus was found both in the margins and open water areas of Grafham Water, a large reservoir in Cambridgeshire, U.K., in September 2010. Both adults and juveniles were present in large numbers and were most frequent in the boulder/cobble areas dominating the margins of the reservoir. Precopula pairs were also evident, as were egg bearing females.
