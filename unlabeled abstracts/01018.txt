Evidence for interspecific hybridization between native white-spotted charr Salvelinus leucomaenis and non-native brown trout Salmo trutta on Hokkaido Island, Japan
Hybrids between native white-spotted charr Salvelinus leucomaenis and non-native brown trout Salmo trutta were identified in streams of Hokkaido, Japan, using both appearance and genetic characters. The DNA analyses indicated that the specimens were hybrids between female S. leucomaenis and male S. trutta. Occurrence of such hybrids implies increased mating opportunities between these species in wild streams.
