Endozoochory by Goats of Two Invasive Weeds with Contrasted Propagule Traits
Invasive plants have very important ecological and socioeconomic impacts. Producing and dispersing many viable seeds are key plant functional traits for invaders. Ungulate grazing plays an important role in the endozoochorous seed dispersal within grasslands and rangelands. Grazing can be applied as a practical and economical control method for plant invasions. We analyzed the effects of seed passage through the goat digestive system on the germination and viability for Sorghum halepense and Malva parviflora, common invasive species with contrasted propagules and seed traits. Both studied species produced seeds able to survive, in a small percentages (c. 0.80-1.70%), after being eaten by goats. Most of the seeds (c. 40-55%) of both species were retrieved between 24-48 h after ingestion. Goat passage provoked a decrease (> 60%) in the germination percentage and seed viability of S. halepense that was higher with longer gut retention times. In M. parviflora, the goat gut passage did not break its primary physical dormancy, since no retrieved seed germinated with similar viability as the uneaten seeds (c. 90%). In view of our results, goat grazing can be applied as a useful method to control S. halepense and M. parviflora invasions. Goats should be kept in corrals for at least 4 days after grazing to prevent transferring viable seeds to uninfected areas.
