Genetic diversity and invasion success of alien species:where are we and where should we go?
Genetic diversity is hypothesized to affect the invasiveness of alien species. Although many alien species have experienced genetic bottlenecks during invasion, multiple introductions and intra- or inter- specific hybridization may result in high levels of genetic variation that are comparable to native conspecifics. This genetic variation could enable plants to adapt to novel habitats through rapid evolution. However, research has shown that genetic uniformity sometimes has little effect on invasiveness, and instead, may even aid successful invasion by some alien species. These results suggest that high levels of genetic diversity are not always necessary in biological invasions. In this review, we explore relationships between genetic diversity and successful invasions. We examine the possible mechanisms through which genetic diversity can influence the short-term success and long-term evolution of alien species. Additionally, we raise and discuss issues that deserve attention in future studies. Future research should unite invasion ecology and other ecological disciplines in order to deepen our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes involved with biological invasions.
