Distribution Characteristics of Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) as an Exotic Species, in Some Medium-to-Large Size Korean Reservoirs and Physico-chemical Water Quality in the Habitats
The objective of this study was to understand the distribution characteristics of largemouth bassas an exotic species in relation to water chemistry. The survey was conducted in 10 reservoirs in Korea thatshowed different properties in size, location and eutrophic state. Total number of fish species observed in theartificial reservoirs was 52 (13 family) and the relative abundance of the bass was 13% of the total, which isthe third dominant species in the whole sample. The relative abundance of bass was the highest in thePyungtak reservoir (60%), whereas the Daechung reservoir showed the lowest abundance (only 3%). Althoughno significance difference statistically were founded in the relationship between bass abundance and waterquality parameters. The reservoir trophic state showed some relationships. As result, the higher abundance wasobserved in hypertrophic reservoirs that located in the esturine regions compared to other large and mediumreservoirs classified as meso- or eutrphic state. In conclusion, bass distribution in the reservoir ecosystem cannot be directly explained by water chemistry only but other environmental factors should be considered.
