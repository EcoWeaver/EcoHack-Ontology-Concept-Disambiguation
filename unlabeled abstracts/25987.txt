Genetic Variation in the Common Reed, Phragmites australis, in the Mississippi River Delta Marshes: Evidence for Multiple Introductions
Multiple introductions are believed to play an important role in increasing genetic diversity and adaptability of invasive species, but there are few well-documented examples. The common reed, Phragmites australis, has dramatically increased in tidal wetlands throughout the USA in the past century due primarily to the introduction of a Eurasian lineage. In the Mississippi River "Balize" delta, P. australis is the dominant vegetation where monotypic stands of an introduced form blanket the outer marshes. The delta's interior marshes, on the other hand, are more vegetatively diverse, serving as important waterfowl foraging habitat. Recent encroachment by various phenotypic forms of P. australis into the interior marshes led to this study examining genetic variation in these stands. Our results revealed four chloroplast DNA haplotypes that also segregate based on microsatellite variation. Three of these are closely related and introduced, but differ relative to time and likely mode of introduction. The "Delta" type (haplotype M1), which is unique to the region and the most common lineage, displays considerable microsatellite diversity. The Eurasian introduced lineage of P. australis (haplotype M), which is invasive elsewhere in North America, is increasing its distribution in the delta. A novel haplotype, AD, was also identified which is phenotypically and genetically similar to haplotype M. Despite the close relatedness, we found no evidence for inter-haplotype gene exchange at the nuclear level, suggesting that intraspecific hybridization is not a contributing factor to these invasions. The site provides a unique opportunity for researchers to understand the dynamics of multiple P. australis invasions. KeywordsMicrosatellite-Haplotype-Invasive species-Genetic variation
