Neophyte Invasion in Moldavia (Eastern Romania) in Different Habitat Types
The actual state of neophyte invasion in Moldavia (Eastern Romania) is described in this paper on the basis of 11,055 phytosociological releves. We analyzed the i) proportion of releves with neophytes, ii) mean proportion of neophytes per releves, and iii) mean coverage of neophytes per releve for 36 EUNIS habitat types to identify general plant invasion patterns. The level of invasion differed considerably between habitats. The invasion of neophytes especially affected habitats strongly determined or influenced by man, such as anthropogenic woodlands, ruderal habitats, arable lands or trampled areas. Most natural habitats are either slightly invaded or entirely free of neophytes. Only riverine willow stands and wet tall-herb stands are relatively highly invaded. However, the absence of neophytes in some natural habitats less represented in the phytosociological dataset could be of artifactual nature. No significant relationship between the number of neophytes and non-neophytes was found in the analysis across different habitats. When the analyses were made within-habitats, both negative and positive relationships were found, which confirm that the relationship between alien and native species richness depends on the habitats. A total number of 105 neophyte species were recorded in the phytosociological releves used in this study. Among these, 13 species that are currently considered invasive in Moldavia occur in at least 10 types of habitats.
