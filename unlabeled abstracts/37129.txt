New records of the invasive macrophyte, Urochloa arrecta extend its range to eastern Brazilian Amazon altered freshwater ecosystems
Invasive species influence the structure and functioning of ecosystems, as they affect native species, significantly decreasing their diversity. Aquatic ecosystems harbor a great biodiversity, and invasive macrophytes significantly affect the native plant communities, causing a cascade effect on other trophic levels. Among invasive macrophytes, Urochloa arrecta is cause for concern in the Neotropics and is found in several regions of Brazil, specially in the southeastern and southern regions. So far the species had been recorded only in the northern state of Amazonas. We report the first record of the species in the state of Para, in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. We emphasize that identifying sites where this species is invasive is the best strategy to prevent its spread, aiming at the protection and conservation of Amazonian freshwater ecosystems.
