Complete genome sequence of the first bluetongue virus serotype 7 isolate from China: evidence for entry of African-lineage strains and reassortment between the introduced and native strains
Bluetongue virus (BTV) mainly infects sheep but can be transmitted to other domestic and wild ruminants, resulting in a considerable financial burden and trade restriction. Our understanding of the origin, movement, and distribution of BTV has been hindered by the fact that this virus has a segmented genome with the possibility of reassortment, the existence of 27 identified serotypes, and a lack of complete sequences of viruses isolated from different parts of the world. BTV serotype 7 is one of the prevalent BTV serotypes in Asia. Nonetheless, no complete genomic sequence of an Asian isolate of this serotype is available. In an effort to understand the molecular epidemiology of BTV infection in China, for the first time, we report here the complete genome sequence of a BTV serotype 7 strain, GDST008, which was isolated in 2014 in China. This sequence also represents the first complete genome sequence of a BTV serotype 7 from Asia and the third one in the world. Sequence analysis suggests that GDST008 consists of segments from BTV viruses of African lineage as well as those from China. Together, these results improve our understanding of the origin, emergence/re-emergence, and movement of BTV and thus can be applied in the development of vaccines and diagnostics.
