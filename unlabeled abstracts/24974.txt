Effect of press cycle time and resin content on physical and mechanical properties of particleboard panels made from the underutilized low-quality raw materials
In this study, the influence of press cycle time and resin content (RC) on some of the physical and mechanical properties of single-layer particleboard manufactured from the low-quality raw materials were determined. Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), saltcedar (Tamarix stricta) and date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) wood, which is underutilized invasive species in southern parts of Iran, were used as alternative raw materials for particleboard manufacturing. Variable factors were as resin content (9, 10 and 11%) and press time (PT) (4, 5 and 6min). Other parameters such as type of resin (UF), hardener content (2%), type of hardener (NH4Cl), press-closing time (4.5mm/s), board density (0.75g/cm3), press pressure (30kg/m2) and press temperature (160degC) were held constant. The experimental panels were tested for their mechanical strength including modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR), internal bonding (IB) and physical stability properties (thickness swelling) according to the procedures defined by European Union (EN) Standard. Overall results showed that most panels made from above-mentioned materials exceed the EN Standards for IB, MOE and MOR. The mechanical properties of particleboard were improved as the resin content increased from 9 to 11%. The results indicated that the polymerization of resin and wood is better at 11% resin content and 5min of press time. However, thickness-swelling (TS) values were higher (poor) than requirements. Panels made of mesquite, saltcedar and date palm with a resin content of 11% and pressed for 5min is adequate for general uses while eucalyptus with a resin content of 11% and pressed for 6min is suitable for interior decoration.
