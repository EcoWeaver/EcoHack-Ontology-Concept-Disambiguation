Ability of European parasitoids (Hymenoptera) to control a new invasive Asiatic pest, Drosophila suzukii
Understanding the ecological factors involved in successful invasions is essential for choosing appropriate management measures. One mechanism recognized as often being essential for invasion success is for the invasive species to be less subject to attack by natural enemies. The spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura, 1931) is an Asian pest of fruit crops that has recently appeared simultaneously in North America and Europe (2008). Here we investigate the effectiveness of European parasitoids of Drosophila in parasitizing D. suzukii. Of the five main European parasitoid species, only two pupal parasitoids with wide host ranges develop on D. suzukii. Two specialized larval parasitoids were unable to develop, presumably because of a strong immune response. The third specialized larval parasitoid rarely oviposited in D. suzukii. This confirms that host switching is often difficult for specialist parasitoids.
