Comparative distribution and invasion risk of snakehead (Channidae) and Asian carp (Cyprinidae) species in North America
As nonindigenous species are a major threat to global biodiversity, cost-effective management requires identification of areas at high risk of establishment. Here we predict suitable environments of 14 high-profile species of nonindigenous snakehead (Channidae) and Asian carp (Cyprinidae) species in North America based upon ecological niche modelling and compare the driving environmental variables for the two fish groups. Snakeheads distributions were correlated with thermal factors, whereas those of Asian carps were related mainly to precipitation. Predicted suitable ranges for these nonindigenous species can be divided into three main areas: Mexico and the southern United States (five species); Mexico and the United States up to ~35 degN (three species); and most of Mexico, continuous United States, and southern Canada (six species). For the province of Ontario, we combined the number and location of aquarium stores and live fish markets with predicted areas of suitable environments to identify areas at risk of introduction and establishment. We identified several watersheds draining into northwestern Lake Ontario as having the highest risk, highlighting the increased predictive value of this approach.
