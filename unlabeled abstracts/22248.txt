Association of a luminous Vibrio sp., taxonomically related to Vibrio harveyi, with Clytia linearis (Thornely, 1900) (Hydrozoa, Cnidaria)
A previously unknown association between a luminous Vibrio sp., taxonomically related to the species Vibrio harveyi and a common member of the shallow/mid water communities of the Mediterranean Sea, the hydrozoan Clytia linearis is described. All the specimens of C linearis observed under blue light excitation showed both a natural luminescence appearing as a series of fine dots due to clytin, and a clear fluorescence on the external side of the perisarc around the colonies due to the presence of luminous bacteria. Luminous bacteria were isolated from the surface of C. linearis, their phenotypic characterization as isolates was performed by several morphological, biochemical, and cultural tests, completed with 16S rDNA sequence analysis. All the isolates were referred to a Vibrio sp. taxonomically related to V. harveyi. The association of the V. harveyi-related species with C. linearis, as already suggested for another hydroid, Aglaophenia octodonta, could be explained with the activity of these bacteria of feeding on the chitinous structures present in these hydroids. Moreover, the adhesion of the luminous bacterium (here referred to as Vibrio sp. CL1) on C linearis may contribute to the survival of this Vibrio species in the marine environment providing a suitable growth habitat.
