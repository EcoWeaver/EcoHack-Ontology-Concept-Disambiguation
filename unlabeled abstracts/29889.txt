Juniper Invasions in Grasslands: Research Needs and Intervention Strategies
On the Ground: *Despite prescribed fire programs, invasive juniper trees are increasing in the Great Plains.*Continued encroachment of junipers in the Great Plains, especially eastern redcedar and Ashe's juniper, is degrading grasslands and increasing health concerns through pollen production.*Biological and ecological research needs include effects on soil and water as well as restoration potential after a mature invasion is treated.*The interface of social science, ecology, economics, and policy may yield productive approaches to slowing the invasion.
