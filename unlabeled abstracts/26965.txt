n-Butyl (E)-7,9-decadienoate: sex pheromone component of the nettle caterpillar, Darna pallivitta
The nettle caterpillar, Darna pallivitta (Moore) (Lepidoptera: Limacodidae), is an invasive pest on the island of Hawai'i, causing defoliation of ornamental nursery stock and posing a human health hazard due to their urticating hairs that can cause painful stings. Wind tunnel and field tests with 2-3-day-old moths revealed behavioral responses of males to caged females, which is indicative of a female-released sex pheromone. Coupled gas chromatography-electroantennogram detection (GC-EAD) analysis of female abdominal tip extracts revealed two male electroantennographically active compounds produced by female D. pallivitta. Mass spectral analysis and subsequent synthesis identified the active compounds as n-butyl (E)-7,9-decadienoate (major component) and ethyl (E)-7,9-decadienoate (minor component), both structurally similar to sex pheromone components previously reported from related Darna spp. Additionally, methyl (E)-7,9-decadienoate was identified from female abdominal tip extracts and a strong EAD response was elicited by the synthetic compound. n-Butyl (E)-7,9-decadienoate was the only component detected by solid phase microextraction (SPME) collections from single calling female moths, however, the apparent absence of minor components may be a result of their lower abundance. Field trials showed significant attraction of male moths to all lures containing the n-butyl ester, while the methyl and ethyl esters did not increase trap captures at the levels and ratios tested. Synthetic pheromone lures (2.5 mg) outperformed virgin moths as attractant baits and could be used for monitoring D. pallivitta populations of the island of Hawai'i and detection on other Hawai'ian islands and at ports and nurseries that receive plants from Hawai'i (e.g., California and Florida).
