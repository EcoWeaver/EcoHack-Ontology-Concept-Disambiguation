Impacts of invasive crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) on endangered freshwater pearl mussels (Margaritifera laevis and M. togakushiensis) in Japan
The invasive alien crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is considered harmful to freshwater pearl mussels Margaritifera laevis and M. togakushiensis. It also often colonises mussel habitats in Japan. In order to test the negative effects of alien crayfish on mussels, we evaluated the predation impact of signal crayfish on freshwater pearl mussels in vitro. We tested the relationship between the survival/injury rates of mussels and crayfish predation with respect to different sizes of mussels (four classes based on shell length: 10, 30, 50 and 70 mm). Crayfish selectively fed on the flesh of the 10-mm size class mussels after breaking their shells. The shell margins of mussels in all size classes were injured by crayfish. Results also showed that crayfish particularly injured the 50-mm size class of mussels. This observation could be attributed to this mussel size being the most suitable shell size (29.56-37.73 mm in carapace length) that the crayfish can effectively hold. This study shows that the presence of invasive crayfish reduces freshwater pearl mussel populations by damaging the shell margins and/or killing the mussels. This negative impact of invasive crayfish not only decreases the mussel population but could also limit mussel recruitment, growth and reproduction.
