Invasive Species Drive Human Poisoning: The Case of the Silver Cheeked Pufferfish Lagocephalus sceleratus (Gmelin, 1789)
Since the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, a phenomenon of biotic immigration, often reported as 'Lessepsian migration', took place from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. Besides causing huge ecological impacts, this massive invasion has resulted in the introduction of toxic species producing tetrodotoxin (TTX), with associated risks for human health. The subject of this review is the silver checked pufferfish Lagocephalus scelaratus, which has rapidly spread through the eastern Mediterranean and is currently expanding. The aim of this study is to provide a review of the current state of the art regarding the presence of L. sceleratus in the Mediterranean Sea and the related emerging problem of food poisoning risks to European consumers due to the tetrodotoxin contained in this species. In addition, the production of tetrodotoxin in pufferfish, its mechanism of action once ingested, and its potential lethality to humans is discussed. Here we listed 93 reported cases of intoxication and 12 deaths due to the consumption of this species in the Mediterranean Sea. It is clear from this review that the likelihood of catching L. sceleratus in the Mediterranean Sea is increasing and consequently the possibility of it accidentally ending up in the food chain. Possible solutions to this emerging issue are reported and discussed.
