Angler preferences for management of aquatic invasive species in the USA and Canada: A discrete choice experiment
Aquatic invasive species (AIS) management in the Great Lakes region of North America requires coordination between multiple agencies and stakeholder groups. Because the Great Lakes are an internationally managed entity, an understanding of policy preferences among stakeholders across borders is crucial for making both comprehensive and evidence-based decisions about fishery resources. We evaluated angler preferences for how future fishing scenarios are affected by aquatic invasive species in the Great Lakes region. Using a mixed-mode survey of anglers in Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, New York, and the Canadian province of Ontario, we conducted a stated choice experiment to understand and compare American and Canadian anglers. Results from a mixed multinomial logit model suggested fish habitat quality, amount of native fish species, impact of invasive species, availability of wash stations, and cost significantly influenced hypothetical scenarios chosen by survey respondents. Fish habitat and increased availability of boat wash stations had the greatest influence on the likelihood that a given scenario would be chosen by a survey respondent. We observed predominantly similar patterns across the border but did find that Canadians had stronger preferences for limiting AIS impacts and improving habitat quality. Our research thus suggests that an internationally consistent management approach would likely be well received among the anglers engaged in this study.
