First records of Mnemiopsis leidyi (Ctenophora) from the Ligurian, Thyrrhenian and Ionian Seas (Western Mediterranean) and first record of Phyllorhiza punctata (Cnidaria) from the Western Mediterranean
The gelatinous macroplankters Mnemiopsis leidyi and Phyllorhiza punctata are recorded for the first time from the Italian coasts of the Western Mediterranean. In the framework of the CIESM Jellywatch campaign in the summer of 2009, M. leidyi was recorded from the Ligurian, Tyrrhenian, and Ionian Seas, including swarming episodes that, together with those reported from Spain in the same period, suggest a great success of the species in the Western Mediterranean. A single specimen of P. punctata has been recorded from Sardinia. These species do not sting or harm humans and no impact on tourism is expected, but they might harm fisheries by predating on fish eggs and larvae and their prey, zooplankton. The large distribution area of M. leidyi suggests that the species invaded the Western Mediterranean during the summer of 2009, but its establishment is still uncertain, since the populations might not withstand winter conditions. The isolated record of P. punctata just indicates that it can reach this part of the Mediterranean.
