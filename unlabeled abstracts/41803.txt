SRM Center for Professional Education and Development: Wildfires and Invasive Plants in American Deserts
The SRM conducted the 'Wildfires and Invasive Plants in American Deserts' conference and workshops in Reno, Nevada, in partnership with 26 other organizations in December 2008. Participants who benefited from this 2.5-day event included 309 registrants representing 17 states and 77 different universities, federal and state agencies, tribal agencies, private landowners, and companies. The series of papers presented here are a synthesis of the presentations and audience input from the five workshops. 'Hot-Desert Fire and Invasive Species Management: Resources, Strategies, Tactics, and Response' workshop focused on the Chihuahuan, Mojave, and Sonoran Deserts. 'Cold-Desert Fire and Invasive Species Management: Resources, Strategies, Tactics, and Response' workshop addressed the Great Basin and the Colorado Plateau, emphasizing sagebrush taxa. The effective management of invasive plants is fraught with impediments leading to ecosystem degradation and biodiversity, habitat, and economic losses. Following the conference, an online evaluation-form was developed with eighty-three participants filling out the survey.
