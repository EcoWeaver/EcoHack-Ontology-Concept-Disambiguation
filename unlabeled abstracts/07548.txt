The efficiency of tobacco Bel-W3 and native species for ozone biomonitoring in subtropical climate, as revealed by histo-cytochemical techniques
We aimed to verify whether hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) accumulation and cell death are detected early in three bioindicators of ozone (O(3)), Nicotiana tabacum 'Bel-W3', Ipomoea nil 'Scarlet O'Hara' and Psidium guajava 'Paluma', and whether environmental factors also affect those microscopic markers. The three species were exposed to chronic levels of O(3) in a subtropical area and a histo-cytochemical technique that combines 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) with Evans blue staining was used in the assessments. The three species accumulated H(2)O(2), but a positive correlation with O(3) concentration was only observed in N. tabacum. A positive correlation between O(3) and cellular death was also observed in N. tabacum. In I. nil and P. guajava, environmental factors were responsible for symptoms at the microscopic level, especially in P. guajava. We conclude that the most appropriate and least appropriate bioindicator plant for O(3) monitoring in the subtropics are N. tabacum 'Bel-W3' and P. guajava 'Paluma', respectively.
