Mate choice errors may contribute to slow spread of an invasive Eurasian longhorn beetle in North America
Tetropium fuscum (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) is a Eurasian longhorn beetle and forest pest that first became invasive to Nova Scotia, Canada around 1990. In the time since its introduction, T. fuscum has spread only about 150 km from its point of introduction. In its invasive range, T. fuscum co-exists with its congener Tetropium cinnamopterum. Although they are ecologically similar species, T. fuscum tends to infest healthier trees and has a smaller host range than T. cinnamopterum. If they successfully interbreed, this could lead to hybrid individuals that are more problematic than either parent species. On the other hand, if T. fuscum can make mating errors in the field, but is not producing hybrid offspring, then this waste of mating resources could help explain the slow spread of T. fuscum in North America. We conducted no-choice and choice mating experiments between T. fuscum and T. cinnamopterum males and females and determined that both T. fuscum and T. cinnamopterum males make mate-choice errors with heterospecific females in a laboratory setting. Our results suggest that mating errors may play a role in the slow spread of T. fuscum in North America.
