A discreet invasion: distribution, origins, and expansion of the European slug complex Arion subfuscus s.l. in Quebec
Accurate identification of species and their geographic origins is crucial to assess the impacts of exotic species. This is particularly relevant when multiple introductions are suspected. Species complexes are therefore problematic, as different species can be treated as a single taxon. The highly diversified European complex Arion subfuscus (Draparnaud, 1805) s.l. is abundant throughout northeastern North America. However, surveys performed in the United States have reported a low mitochondrial diversity associated with a single species. To assess whether regions characterized by different human activities harbor different diversities, the taxonomic identities, distributions, and origins of the species of this complex in Quebec (Canada) were determined. The mitochondrial 16S rDNA gene was analyzed in 526 specimens from 69 locations. Both Arion fuscus (O.F. Muller, 1774) and Arion subfuscus (Draparnaud, 1805) s. str. (lineages S1 and S2) were detected. Arion fuscus was the most abundant species, contrasting with previous studies conducted in North America. An explosive range expansion occurred during the last 50 years. Moreover, the presence of different haplotypes confirmed multiple introductions of these species. These results emphasize the importance of not considering an exotic species complex as a single taxon, especially in regions with different human activities.
