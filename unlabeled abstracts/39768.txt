A rapidly established population of the invader mysid Neomysis americana (S.I. Smith, 1873) in the Seine estuary
The mysid Neomysis americana (S.I. Smith, 1873), which originates from North-American estuaries, was reported for the first time in 2017 in the Seine estuary (English Channel, France). This sighting represents the second reported occurrence of this species in Europe, following the record of two individuals in 2010 in the Wadden Sea (Netherlands). Its appearance seems recent since no individuals were recorded in previous intensive sampling carried out in the navigational channel and North Channel of the Seine estuary since the middle of the 1990s. In 2017, a total of 2674 individuals of N. americana were sampled, showing the rapid establishment of a reproductive population which was favorised by the decline of the autochthonous population of Neomysis integer (Leach, 1814).
