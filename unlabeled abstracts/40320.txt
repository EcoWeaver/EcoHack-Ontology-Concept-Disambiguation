New invasive predator reduces the abundance of native prey in a cold-temperate marine fouling community
* Invasive species threaten the conservation of marine environments, and urgent management strategies are needed to prevent their introduction, establishment and spread. Specifically, marine invasive predators destabilize ecological interactions and alter community structure and function. However, most of the evidence showing the effect of these predators is restricted to a few species and regions, while for others the information remains scarce. * This study experimentally evaluated the ecological effects of the sea slug Pleurobranchaea maculata, a recently introduced invasive predator, on the fouling communities of a cold-temperate port in the South-western Atlantic. * The results show that increasing predation pressure reduces significantly the abundance of sea anemones, which are among the preferred prey items. * This study reveals new evidence to help better understand the effects of P. maculata on the biological communities of a recently invaded region. Furthermore, it provides the first experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that marine invasive predators can induce a significant decrease in the abundance of native species in benthic communities of cold-temperate marine environments in the South-western Atlantic.
