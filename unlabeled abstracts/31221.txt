Introduction and dispersal of non-native bullseye snakehead Channa marulius (Hamilton, 1822) in the canal system of southeastern Florida, USA
An established population of bullseye snakehead (Channa marulius), a large predatory fish from southeastern Asia, was identified for the first time in North America from waters in southeastern Florida, USA, in the year 2000. Since then, it has dispersed throughout the extensive canal system in the area from West Palm Beach south to Miramar. Collection data were compiled to determine the extent of the distribution. The range encompasses three separate areas totaling approximately 830 km2. Over an 18-year period, the range increased an average of approximately 46 km2 per year. There is concern that this non-native species may threaten the fauna in unique protected natural areas of southern Florida, such as Everglades National Park.
