Hybridization between invasive Spartina densiflora (Poaceae) and native S. foliosa in San Francisco Bay, California, USA.
Rapid evolution in contemporary time can result when related species, brought together through human-aided introduction, hybridize. The significant evolutionary consequences of post-introduction hybridization range from allopolyploid speciation to extinction of species through genetic amalgamation. Both processes are known to occur in the perennial cordgrass genus, Spartina. Here we report the existence of a third recent Spartina hybridization, discovered in 2002, between introduced S. densiflora and native S. foliosa in San Francisco Bay, California, USA. We used nuclear and chloroplast DNA analysis and nuclear DNA content with chromosome counts to examine plants of morphology intermediate between S. densiflora and S. foliosa in a restored marsh in Marin County, California. We found 32 F(1) diploid hybrids and two triploid plants, all having S. densiflora and S. foliosa as parents; there is also evidence of a genetic contribution of S. alterniflora in some hybrids. None of these hybrids set germinable seed. In 2007 we found a hybrid over 30 miles away in a marsh where both parental species occurred, suggesting hybridization may not be a localized phenomenon. The presence of diploid and triploid hybrids is important because they indicate that several avenues existed that may have given rise to a new allopolyploid species. However, such an event is now unlikely because all hybrids are targets of eradication efforts.
