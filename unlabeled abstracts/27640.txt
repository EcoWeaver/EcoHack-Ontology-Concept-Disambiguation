The role of behavioural variation in the invasion of new areas
This chapter examines behaviour during invasion of new areas, specifically on the period of spread, the post-establishment stage of invasion. It discusses the processes that lead to population spread, and some of the behaviours that facilitate those processes. It investigates the role of behaviour in determining the outcomes of interspecific interactions between introduced and resident species. Using both cases, it highlights behaviour and the effect of behavioural variation. It presents how behavioural variation not only matters, but that it is central to understanding both the process of invasion and the impact of invaders on natives. It argues the importance of understanding behavioural variation is critical in understanding the long-term impacts of invasive species in a rapidly changing world.
