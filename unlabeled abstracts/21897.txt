Evolution of invasiveness in plants following hybridization
Despite the fact that invasion biology started as a science grounded almost exclusively in ecology, it rapidly embraced evolutionary research in the last decade. As the contents of this Special Issue testify, the subfield of evolution of invasiveness by hybridization has received increasing attention. Hybrid derived invasives have proved to be an excellent opportunity for the study of the evolution of invasiveness.
