Optimal Integrated Strategies to Control an Invasive Weed
Although there have been numerous studies on the economics of weed control in agriculture, relatively few studies have focused on weeds in natural ecosystems. A stochastic dynamic simulation model and a stochastic dynamic programming model are developed to: (A) identify the combination of control options that is optimal for blackberry (Rubus anglocandicans) in Australian natural ecosystems, (B) assess whether an integrated control strategy is superior to chemical-only strategies, (C) evaluate the net benefits of biological control (a rust and grazing by goats), and (D) determine how changes in model parameters affect the optimal control strategy. The results indicate that, while an integrated strategy combining chemical and nonchemical control methods may be optimal in certain circumstances, it is not necessarily superior to a chemical-dominant strategy in all cases. The results show that grazing goats for control of blackberry can be optimal despite uncertainty about its effectiveness. Policy makers need to be aware of the trade-offs between choosing more effective control options that may impose environmental and health risks versus less effective control strategies that are safer to the environment and human health.
