Are wild boars roaming Ireland once more?
Wild boars (Sus scrofa) have been increasingly sighted in the wild in Ireland during the last few years, likely due to illegal releases and/or escapees. The species has since been designated an invasive species in Ireland, which is seen as controversial by some because of uncertainties about the historic status of the species in Ireland. However, just as pertinent to the argument is the genetic purity of these individuals currently found in Ireland: are these pure wild boars? We carried out a genetic assessment of 15 wild boars shot in Ireland between 2009 and 2012 using 14 microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). These were compared to European wild boar, domestic pig breeds and a hybrid population of 'wild boar' from England. Microsatellite analysis revealed that almost all the Irish individuals belonged to the 'domestic pig' genetic cluster, with only three individuals being classified as hybrids. All but two individuals carried Asian mtDNA haplotypes, indicating a domestic pig origin. It is clear from this study that the individuals currently found in Ireland are not pure wild boars and this result has to be factored into any management/eradication plans.
