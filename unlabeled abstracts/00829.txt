Editorial commentary on 'patterns and uncertainties of species' range shifts under climate change'.
The need for anticipating and mitigating the potential effects of climate change on biodiversity has triggered the development of predictive tools to provide quantitative scenarios to guide decision making (Pereira et al., 2010). Notably, the recently established 'Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services' (IPBES) will rely on these predictive tools. Between 1990 and 2000, statistical models that relate species occurrences to climatic variables were developed to predict species ranges and to forecast potential changes under the strong assumption that the detected relationships between the species of interest and the selected climatic variables will hold into the future (reviewed in Guisan & Thuiller, 2005).This article is protected by copyright.
