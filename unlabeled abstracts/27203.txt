Larval taxonomy and early identification of topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva: a screening tool to reduce risks of unintentional species translocation
Abstract  To minimise the risks of unintentional translocation and further spread of the non-native cyprinid, Pseudorasbora parva (Temminck & Schlegel) in the UK, various morphological and meristic characters of this species were measured, with a view to isolating the characters which allow reliable identification of this species during the early stages of development. The combination of myomere numbers, the nature of the internal pigmentation associated with the notochord and the lack of a single row of external melanophores along the route of the lateral line organ reliably facilitate the ability to distinguish this species from the native fauna of the British Isles. Thus, for the first time, fishery managers and environmental agencies have a much needed tool to screen for the presence young-of-the-year of this species when authorising movements of other fish species.
