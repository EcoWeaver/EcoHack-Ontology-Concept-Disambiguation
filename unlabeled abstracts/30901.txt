Aliens in Transylvania: risk maps of invasive alien plant species in Central Romania
Using the MAXENT algorithm, we developed risk maps for eight invasive plant species in southern Tran-sylvania, Romania, a region undergoing drastic land-use changes. Our findings show that invasion risk increased with landscape heterogeneity. Roads and agricultural areas were most prone to invasion, whereas forests were least at risk.
