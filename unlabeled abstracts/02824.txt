The non-indigenous Paranthura japonica Richardson, 1909 (Isopoda: Anthuroidea: Paranthuridae) from the Mar Piccolo lagoon, Taranto (Italy, Mediterranean Sea).
Several individuals of Paranthura japonica, a non-indigenous isopod species, recently recorded on Italian coasts, have been collected from the Mar Piccolo basin, Taranto (Italy). This finding extends the distributional range of the species southwards in the Mediterranean, including a semi-enclosed coastal basin, which is considered the second Italian hotspot for the introduction of alien species. The characteristics of the place reinforce the hypothesis that its introduction is linked to shellfish trade and farming. Remarks on the morphology and ecology are included.
