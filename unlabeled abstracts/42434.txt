Plant invasion alters latitudinal pattern of plant-defense syndromes
The relationship between herbivory and latitude may differ between native and introduced populations of invasive plants, which can generate latitudinal heterogeneity in the strength of enemy release. However, still little is known about how latitudinal heterogeneity in herbivore pressure influences latitudinal variation in defense phenotypes of invasive plants. We tested how latitudinal patterns in multi-variate defense syndromes differed between native (Argentinian) and introduced (Chinese) populations of the invasive herb Alternanthera philoxeroides. In addition, to better understand the drivers underlying latitudinal patterns, we also tested whether associations of defense syndromes with climate and herbivory differed between native and introduced ranges. We found that native plant populations clustered into three main defense syndromes associated with latitude. In contrast, we only found two defense syndromes in the introduced range. One matched the high-latitude syndrome from the native range, but was distributed at both the northern and southern range limits in the introduced range. The other was unique to the introduced range and occurred at mid-latitudes. Climatic conditions were associated with variation in syndromes in the native range, and climatic conditions and herbivory were associated with variation in syndromes in the introduced range. Together, our results demonstrate that plants may under the new environmental conditions in the introduced range show latitudinal patterns of defense syndromes that are different from the ones in their native range. This emphasizes that geographical dependence of population differentiation should be explicitly considered in studies on the evolution of defense in invasive plants.
