Alien Naididae species (Annelida: Clitellata) and their role in aquatic habitats in Poland
Up to now 17 alien species of family Naididae have been found in Poland. The majority of them have a Ponto-Caspian origin (Potamothrix hammoniensis, P. moldaviensis, P. heuscheri, P. vejdovskyi, P. bavaricus, P. bedoti, Psammoryctides barbatus, P. albicola, P. moravicus, Tubifex newaensis, Isochaetides michaelseni, Paranais simplex and P. frici). Moreover, North American (Quistadrilus multisetosus, Limnodrilus cervix) and thermophilic species from Asia (Branchiura sowerbyi) and South Europe or North Africa (Tubifex blanchardi) have been recorded. Almost all alien species are known from a small number of localities, except for Potamothrix hammoniensis, P. moldaviensis, Psammoryctides barbatus and P. albicola, but only the first of these seems to be an invasive species influencing the composition of benthic communities in the profundal of lakes.
