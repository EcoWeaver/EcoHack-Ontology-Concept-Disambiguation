Distribution of invasive species Swida alba (L.) Opiz (Cornaceae) and communities with its participation in Bryansk oblast
The paper shows the distribution of the invasive shrub Swida alba (L.) Opiz (Cornaceae) and characterizes the ecological features of shrub habitats and communities with its participation. The communities of hygrophyte floodplain tree and shrub vegetation with the high phytocoenotic role of S. alba are revealed. The assumption of a negative effect of S. alba invasion on communities is made, which is expressed in a decrease in specific richness of grassy plants under a forest canopy in the communities under study.
