Sexual reproduction in the invasive bryozoan Amathia verticillata (Ctenostomatida: Vesiculariidae)
The invasive bryozoan Amathia verticillata has been associated with native biodiversity and economic losses around the world and in 2009, it was detected on one island of the Azores Archipelago and has since spread to other islands. The present study provides insights into the reproductive strategies of this species through the analysis of brooded embryos, the number of internodes and the degree of colony branching over a one year period in more than 200 colonies. These remote oceanic islands provide good environmental conditions for A. verticillata to diversify its gene pool, since the species is able to carry out sexual reproduction year-round. In contrast, population dynamics of A. verticillata seem to be strongly correlated with changes in temperature and the local photoperiod. Field intervention aimed at reducing the population in affected areas should be conducted in the winter when the number of potential colonizing fragments that might be generated by intervention is smaller.
