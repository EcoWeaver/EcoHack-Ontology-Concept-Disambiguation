Field study demonstrates that exotic parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) of mealybugs (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) are absent from a native forest habitat in New Zealand
Laboratory-based, physiological host-range tests of classical biocontrol agents may be complemented by examining the ecological (realised) host-range of similar, previously established species. Sentinel long-tailed mealybugs (Pseudococcus longispinus (Targioni-Tozzetti)) on potted citrus plants, and two species of native mealybugs on potted native trees, were placed in pairs in an orchard and a native forest block 500 m away. Sentinel P. longispinus on citrus plants were also placed along transects anchored in each habitat and extending towards the other by 100-150 m. Parasitoids were reared from the retrieved mealybugs. P. longispinus in the orchard was regularly parasitized by four species of exotic Encyrtidae, but was never parasitized by them in the native forest even though the parasitoids were present in the surrounding environment. Sentinel native mealybugs were not parasitized by any species in either habitat, although native parasitoids (especially Errolium sp. (Hym: Platygastridae) and unidentified Hym: Aphelinidae) were collected from native mealybugs within the native forest.
