Acoustic patterns of an invasive species: the Red-billed Leiothrix (Leiothrix luteaScopoli 1786) in a Mediterranean shrubland
The Red-billed Leiothrix (Leiothrix lutea) is an invasive species which has recently been found to be locally abundant in eastern Liguria (Italy). The song production of this bird was recorded over the course of an entire year (2011) and evaluated using both aural information and applying innovative automatic processing metrics. Our findings revealed that the Red-billed Leiothrix has loud vocalizations that are heard for most of the year, including in July and August when other birds are silent. Its song production has been estimated to amount to 37% of the sounds uttered by the entire bird community. The next most vocal species are the European Robin (36%), the Common Blackbird (18%), the Subalpine Warbler (5%) and the Sardinian Warbler (1%). The Red-billed Leiothrix can be seen as a new acoustically dominant species and, consequently, a potential modifier of the soundscape patterns of the indigenous bird community. The modification of acoustic traits in the repertoire of both indigenous species and the Red-billed Leiothrix is to be expected according to a co-evolution hypothesis.
