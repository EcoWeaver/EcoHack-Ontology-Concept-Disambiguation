Invasion, distribution and habitat affiliation of Cyperus esculentus, a new weed in Slovenia
Abstract Cyperus esculentus (yellow nutsedge) is an alien species that started to spread in arable fields in Slovenia and has already become a noxious weed. In this study we present the spatio-temporal pattern of this invasion in Slovenia. Species was first recorded in 1980 and currently two hotspots are evident (Ljubljana Basin and Posocje). Habitat preferences of Cyperus esculentus and the floristic compostion of invaded plant communities were studied. These communites were compared to similar communities in Slovenia and to so far described vegetation types with dominating Cyperus esculentus in Europe. Based on these analyses we described new weed association, namely Digitario sanguinalis-Cyperetum esculenti.
