Compounding the Disturbance: Family Forest Owner Reactions to Invasive Forest Insects
Invasive forest insect and pathogens (FIP) are having significant, direct, adverse impacts. Interactions between FIPs and forest owners have the potential to create ecosystem impacts that compound direct impacts. We assessed family forest owners' responses to numerous contingent behavior, FIP-outbreak scenarios in the northeastern USA based on FIP outbreak attributes. The survey was divided into four versions and each respondent was given four hypothetical scenarios and asked to gauge their certainty of each response. Sixty-eight percent of the hypothetical scenario responses (n=2752) indicated an intent to harvest as a result of FIPs, and 49% indicated this intent with certainty. Eighty-four percent of respondents (n=688) would consider harvesting for at least one of the four hypothetical scenarios presented, and 67% of respondents were certain of their intent to harvest for at least one of the four hypothetical scenarios. Harvest intention increased with greater FIP-related tree mortality and decreased with delayed total tree mortality. Owners with larger holdings, who had previously harvested forest products, and live on their forestland had greater intentions to harvest in response to FIPs. Results suggest that FIPs could transform the regional harvest regime with socio-ecological impacts that are distinct from those caused by FIPs or harvesting alone.
