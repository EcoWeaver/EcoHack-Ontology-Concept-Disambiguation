A Floristic Study of a Steephead Stream in Northwestern Florida
Steepheads are unique ravine habitats of the Gulf Coastal Plain; however, the biology of these habitats is relatively unknown. The objectives of this study were to provide a comprehensive list of wetland plant species along a steephead stream in Santa Rosa County, FL and to compare the floristics along the stream. Species richness (S = 102), evenness (J' = 0.86), and diversity (H' = 3.97) were calculated as well as taxonomic richness (G = 67 genera), evenness (GJ' = 0.95), and diversity (GH' = 3.98). Upstream and downstream sections harbored distinct plant communities (Jaccard index [JI] = 13.33%). The high diversity and lack of non-native species illustrates the need for further investigation into steephead habitats.
