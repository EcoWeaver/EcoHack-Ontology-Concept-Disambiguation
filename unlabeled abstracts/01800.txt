Coselected genes determine adaptive variation in herbivore resistance throughout the native range of Arabidopsis thaliana
Significance How organisms adapt to the biotic and abiotic environment is a major question in evolutionary biology that addresses how natural selection shapes biodiversity. Using mass spectrometry, we characterized natural variation in major defense molecules, aliphatic glucosinolates, in hundreds of ecotypes of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana , spanning the native range of the species. Using extensive genomic resources and field experiments, we provide strong evidence that populations are adapted to local herbivore communities along a striking longitudinal cline. In addition, we show that only a few genes of strong effect govern this natural variation and that alleles at these genes, located on different chromosomes, appear to have coevolved through epistatic selection.
