Occurrence of the Malabar grouper Epinephelus malabaricus (Bloch & Schneider, 1801) (Actinopterygii, Perciformes, Serranidae), in the Maltese Islands
The capture of a single specimen of the Malabar grouper Epinephelus malabaricus (Bloch & Schneider, 1801) from inside the breakwater at the entrance to the Grand Harbour at Valletta, Malta in July 2011 is reported. Previously this Lessepsian immigrant species was only known from Israeli waters where it is established but rare. On the presently available evidence, the Maltese specimen has to be considered as a casual, most likely transported by shipping.
