New Cnidaria species in Saratov oblast waterbodies (Povolzhye)
Cnidaria species that were earlier unknown in the waterbodies of Saratov oblast have been found in this region in the last decade. Colonies of Cordylophora caspia (Pallas, 1771) were found on stems of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. in the basin cooler of the Balakovo nuclear power plant (Saratov water reservoir), while the freshwater jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbii Lankaster, 1880 was found in the Saratovka River (Volgograd water reservoir). It is possible that these species penetrate into waterbodies with foreign plants or are introduced by birds. Another possibility is that their discovery is due to a more thorough examination of the waterbodies' biota.
