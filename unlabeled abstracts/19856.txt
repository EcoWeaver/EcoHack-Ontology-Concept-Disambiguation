Use of wetland versus open habitats by round gobies in lakes Michigan and Huron: Patterns of CPUE, length, and maturity
It has been suggested that some Great Lakes coastal wetlands may be resistant to invasion by several non-indigenous species including round goby, Neogobius melanostomus. However, there is inconclusive evidence regarding how susceptible exposed fringing coastal wetlands, in particular, are to round goby invasion. Therefore, we quantified round goby catch per unit effort (CPUE) using fyke nets in the Beaver Archipelago of Lake Michigan, and the Les Cheneaux islands and Saginaw Bay regions of Lake Huron. In addition, we examined the influence of body size and maturity on round goby habitat use. Catch per unit effort from fyke nets was highest in the Beaver Archipelago, where wetlands were dominated by small, immature round gobies and open water habitats were dominated by large adults. Fyke net catches within Les Cheneaux sites were similar between habitats and differences in size and maturity were not observed. Conversely, very few round goby were captured in wetlands of Saginaw Bay where CPUE was moderate in open water. This indicates that some exposed fringing wetlands in the Great Lakes, specifically those with high productivity, could have a higher degree of resistance to round goby invasion.
