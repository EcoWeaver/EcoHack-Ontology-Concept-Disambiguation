Fuscumol and fuscumol acetate are general attractants for many species of cerambycid beetles in the subfamily Lamiinae
(E)-6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-ol (fuscumol) is an important component of male-produced aggregation pheromones for several species of cerambycid beetles in the genus Tetropium (subfamily Aseminae/Spondylidinae). Here, we describe the experiments that tested the hypothesis that fuscumol and/or fuscumol acetate also are general attractants for species in the cerambycid subfamily Lamiinae. At field sites in northwestern Indiana and central Texas (USA), panel traps baited with fuscumol or its acetate captured 331 lamiine beetles, compared to 11 beetles captured in control traps. Three species were attracted to traps baited with fuscumol as a single component, whereas another four species were attracted to fuscumol acetate alone. Surprisingly, fuscumol acetate also attracted two species in the subfamily Cerambycinae: Xylotrechus colonus (Fabricius) (males of which produce a pheromone composed only of stereoisomers of 2,3-hexanediol and 3-hydroxyhexan-2-one), and Obrium maculatum (Olivier) (for which a pheromone has yet to be identified). In an independent field experiment in east-central Illinois (USA), traps baited with fuscumol and/or its acetate captured 136 beetles of eight lamiine species, all but one species of which were also captured in the other experiment. Blending fuscumol and its acetate did not inhibit responses of species to either of the individual compounds, but synergized their activity for one species. Our results support the hypothesis that fuscumol and fuscumol acetate are widespread pheromone components or attractants for a variety of cerambycid species, especially lamiines in the tribe Acanthocinini.
