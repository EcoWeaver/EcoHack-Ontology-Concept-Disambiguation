Emergency surveillance for marine pests after the grounding of the container vessel, MVRena
The grounding of the MV Rena in 2011 necessitated urgent entry of salvage vessels into New Zealand. Two, a cargo barge and tug, had been idle in Australia before mobilisation and had well-developed biofouling assemblages that included non-indigenous species new to New Zealand. Surveillance for the species was initiated in Tauranga harbour, Astrolabe Reef and Motiti Island, where the vessels had operated. Response personnel were trained to recognise and report the organisms and active surveys were implemented, including reinspection of the vessels after treatment of the biofouling, dive and shoreline searches, and trapping. Although none of the risk species was detected, the biosecurity risk from the vessels changed during the response, from initially acting as a vector for species new to New Zealand to later transporting non-indigenous species from coastal ports to the arena of operations. The study highlights a need for better integration of biosecurity risk management into forward planning for maritime incidents.
