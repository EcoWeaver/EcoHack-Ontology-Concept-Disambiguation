Euschistus crenator (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae): a New Invasive Species on Soybean Fields in Northern Brazil
The expansion of soybean Glycine max (L.) Merrill in South America has provided an abundant host to the native arthropod fauna. Stink bugs (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) are severe pests on soybean crops due to their feeding activities. Several native species have been recorded on this crop, with the widespread Neotropical brow stink bug Euschistus heros (Fabricius) recognized as the key pest in most of its distribution. Here, we report for the first time Euschistus crenator (Fabricius) as a new invasive species on soybean fields in Northern Brazil. We collected the species at Para state (2deg38'32.2''S 54deg55'56.1''W and 4deg06'31.2''S 54deg55'01.9''W) and Roraima state (2deg39'41.3''N 60deg46'58.9''W and 3deg00'44.6''N 60deg22'32.9''W). The latter represents a new state record, and the first represents new locality records, however, both representing the first soybean host record for the species. The distribution of E. crenator ranges from southern US (AZ, CA, FL, and TX) to north South America, mostly between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. Despite overlap in distribution, we did not find E. crenator and E. heros simultaneously on soybean crops in the North region (Amazon Forest) of Brazil. Euschistus crenator was able to complete its life cycle and had viable offspring on soybean plants, with development parameters similar to E. heros.
