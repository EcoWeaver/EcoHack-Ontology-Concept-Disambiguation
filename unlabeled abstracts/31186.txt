Cytoskeletal connectivity may guide erythrocyte membrane ex- and invagination - A discussion point how biophysical principles might be exploited by a parasite invading erythrocytes
To the editor, A series of biophysical and biochemical studies on erythrocyte membrane properties indicate that cytoskeletal connectivity influences membrane curvature. Increase in cytoskeleton/membrane interactions induce a bias towards membrane exvagination [1], whereas loss of connectivity and thus an increase in loose filament ends spontaneously endows the membrane with a concave curvature, eventually ending in the formation of endovesicles [2]. In light of recent findings on the host proteincomposition of the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) in erythrocytes infected by different apicomplexan species, we propose the hypothesis that the tick-borne intra-erythrocyte parasite Babesia divergens manipulates the host cytoskeleton to drive its invasion process.
