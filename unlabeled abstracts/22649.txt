The influence of timber harvest on the structure and composition of riparian forests in the Coastal Redwood region
The composition and structure of riparian forests in the coast redwood region were analyzed in relation to the length of time since timber harvest, and the width of riparian buffer zone. Ten sites were sampled in the central range of the coast redwood forest type within a variety of post-harvest age groups and riparian buffer zone widths. Data was collected using randomly selected sample plots adjacent to perennial coastal steams. Correlation Fisher's r to z tests and two-tailed t-test were used to examine the relationship between the sample variables and the experimental parameters "years since harvest", and "width of buffer." Results indicate that canopy cover was negatively correlated to "years since harvest" with the highest level of canopy cover found on the youngest sites and the lowest level found on the old-growth sites. The hardwood to conifer dominance ratio and the basal area of Alnus rubra (red alder) were correlated negatively to both "years since harvest" and "buffer width" indicating that timber harvest favored hardwood species. Late seral associates such as Oxalis oregana (redwood sorrel), Anthyrium filix-femina (lady fern), and Vaccinium parviflorum (billberry) were found preferentially in older forests and sites with wider buffer zones, while non-native species such as Hedera helix (English ivy), Pampas cortedaria (pampas grass), and Myosotis latifolia (forget-me-not) were found preferentially in younger forests and areas with smaller buffer zones.
