Recreational boats as a vector of secondary spread for aquatic invasive species and native crustacean zooplankton
Recreational boats in tow between lakes are a known vector of the spread of aquatic invading species (AIS), but we have no test of the hypothesis that recreational boats are also a vector of secondary spread of AIS among freshwater ecosystems via in-water transport i.e., while boating between interconnected waterways. In this study, we surveyed recreational boaters travelling into Lake Simcoe (44250N, 79200W), Ontario, Canada, on their recreational activities, boat maintenance, and travel destinations, measured the degree of vessel fouling, and sampled all standing water and attached macrophytes associated with their vessels. A total of 321 zooplankton individuals comprising 15 different species were collected from the standing water in vessels, including veligers of the invasive zebra mussel Dreissena. The volume of water collected within the vessels significantly increased the number of zooplankton transported. Zooplankton species from pelagic habitats or with planktonic life stages were collected more frequently than species that occupy littoral or benthic habitats, likely reflecting the recreational activities of boaters. Patterns of boater activities, movements and hygiene habits, suggest recreational boating in the Lake Simcoe region is contributing to the spread of native and invasive species into nearby waterways. Our study validates the widespread assumption that recreational boats are an important in-water vector for the secondary spread of both native and invasive zooplankton species. Future management strategies to reduce the spread of AIS should be aimed at increasing awareness of boater hygiene practices, particularly the frequent draining of standing water.
