Coexistence between the southern river otter and the alien invasive North American mink in marine habitats of southern Chile
The interaction between native and introduced predators can be an important determinant of the success of introduced species and of the magnitude of their effects. In Europe, it has been shown that the American mink (Neovison vison) can be affected by native competitors, however such evidence has not been found in South America. We studied the Southern river otter (Lontra provocax) and the American mink at five marine sites, where they coexisted, and at one freshwater site, where only mink were present, in southern Chile. We used their signs to study their habitat use and diet, and radio-tracking to study their activity patterns. The results indicated that otters and mink tended to use different habitats in the marine environments, the otter favouring littoral areas that are rocky and steep while the mink favouring areas of gravel and with a gentle-sloping intertidal zone. These differences were reflected also in their diet. At one of the coastal sites where the diet of the two species was similar, the activity pattern of mink was mostly diurnal, which is unusual. While differential habitat use may be the way through which the American mink is able to coexist with the Southern river otter in coastal habitats of southern Chile, it is possible that otters are having an effect on individual mink by affecting their activity patterns.
