Endangered algal species and how to protect them
In August 2005 at the Eighth International Phycological Congress in Durban, South Africa, a workshop brought together expertise in an attempt to answer some major questions regarding the conservation of algae. The outcome, presented here, considers whether microalgal and macroalgal species are endangered and what possible methods and tactics are necessary to achieve realistic protection, including the potential use of culture collections in the conservation of algae and application of legislation that exists to protect species and habitats. There is evidence that there are endangered algae and that some have become extinct in recent years. The concept for the microalgae that 'everything is everywhere' is challenged. Evidence that some species have restricted ranges means that their biogeography has to be taken into account in their conservation. For the marine macroalgae, evidence of the impact of climate change, ocean acidification and introduced species on native floras is often anecdotal and points to the need for long-term monitoring and scientific study to determine changes in abundance and distribution. The use of species and site designations, including biodiversity action plans, important plant areas and key biodiversity areas are explored as ways forward for algal conservation and the raising of public awareness. Ex situ conservation in the form of actively growing culture collections or in suspended animation cryogenically is a means of conserving algae at least for a restricted number of species and as a last resort; although, the success of reintroductions is unknown. Legislation is considered as the best method in which algae can be given protection. It is concluded that taxonomie knowledge and a global approach are vital to the conservation of the algae.
