Distribution and Reproductive Characteristics of Nonindigenous and Invasive Marine Algae in the Hawaiian Islands
Quantitative and qualitative surveys were conducted on five of the main Hawaiian Islands to determine the current distribution of nonindigenous algae and to assess the level of impact that these algal species pose to Hawai'i's marine ecosystems. Maps were generated to examine the spread of these organisms from initial sites of introduction and to assimilate information regarding habitat characteristics that appear to make some sites more susceptible to invasion than others. Blooms of native invasive algae were also documented when encountered. The potential for vegetative propagation via fragmentation was examined experimentally as a mode of reproduction for four of the most common species of nonindigenous algae in Hawai'i. This research has demonstrated that each of these algal species currently has a distinctive distribution and reproductive strategies appear to vary among species. More research is needed to further understand the competitive strategies and unique ecological characteristics that allow these nonindigenous species to become highly successful in the Hawaiian Islands.
