A Preliminary Study on the Distribution Pattern, Feeding Behavior and Invasiveness of the Exotic Fish, Chitala ornata (Clown Knife Fish) in the Sub Water Ways of Attanagalu Oya
Increasing threat from the introduced invasive species has been identified as one of the major risk factors for the extinction of freshwater fishes. There are number of identified freshwater alien species which have become invasive within Sri Lankan natural waters. However, there is a dearth of information regarding many of these alien invasive species. Therefore, this research project focused on elucidation of distribution pattern, food and feeding habitats and invasiveness of Chitala ornata, an alien invasive freshwater fish species in a potentially new site of infestation in the Attanagalu oya and its tributaries over a period of three months as a preliminary study. Over the study period, 50 individuals of C. ornata were collected using hook and line fishing gear. Gut analyses of captured fish indicated that C. ornata feeds on significant number of native fish species such as Labeo dussumeri, Puntius kelumi, Mystus vittatus, Ompok bimaculatus and Megalops cyprinoides. Out of these five species P. kelumi is listed as an endangered endemic species. Other than fishes, one shrimp species, molluscs and fish eggs were also recorded as their food items. Further, other exotic species such as Pterygoplichthys spp. and Osphronemus goramy were also recorded in the Attanagalu oya. It was concluded that immediate steps should be taken to manage this potentially harmful Alien invasive species in the Attanagalu Oya basin.
