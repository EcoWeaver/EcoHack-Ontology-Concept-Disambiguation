Typhaxglauca dominance and extended hydroperiod constrain restoration of wetland diversity
Urban wetlands typically have few plant species. In wetlands designed to improve water quality, nutrient-rich water and highly variable water levels often favor aggressive, flood-tolerant plants, such as Typha x glauca (hybrid cattail). At Des Plaines River Wetlands Demonstration Site (Lake Co., IL), we assessed T. x glauca dominance and plant community composition under varying hydroperiods in a complex of eight constructed wetlands. Plots flooded for more than 5 weeks during the growing season tended to be dominated by T. x glauca, while plots flooded fewer days did not. Plots with high cover of T. x glauca had low species richness (negative correlation, R2 = 0.72, p < 0.001). However, overall species richness of the wetland complex was high (94 species), indicating that wetlands in urbanizing landscapes can support many plant species where T. x glauca is not dominant. T. x glauca-dominated areas resisted the establishment of a native plant community. Removing T. x glauca and introducing native species increased diversity initially, but did not prevent re-invasion. Although 12 of the 24 species we seeded became established in our cleared plots, T. x glauca rapidly re-invaded. In year 1, T. x glauca regained an average of 11 ramets m-2, and its density doubled in year 2. The likelihood of planted species surviving decreased as duration of inundation increased, and in both seeded and planted plots, graminoids had greater survivorship through year 2 than forbs across a range of water levels. Within 4 years, however, T. x glauca was the most common plant, present in 92% of the cleared plots. Simply removing T. x glauca and adding propagules to an urban wetland is not sufficient to increase diversity.
