First records of the potential pest species Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae) in Europe
Drosophila suzukii ovoposits and feeds on healthy fruits, unlike most other Drosophila species. It has been traditionally reported from Asia, but in the last 2 years it has been recorded from North America, where it is causing a lot of agricultural damage. Herein we report the first records of, D. suzukii in Europe. It has been found in different localities expanding an altitudinal range from 27 to 1550 m above sea level (ab.s.l). Furthermore by comparing collections of drosophilids from different European populations distributed along a latitudinal cline we were able to determine its high dispersal ability since it spread approximately 1400 km in 1 year either actively or passively through infested fruits. The similarities of the introduction dates in North America and Europe and the COI haplotypes suggest that the two invasions could be related. No considerable damage on crops has been reported yet in Europe. However, if this species gets established in more temperate localities it could become a serious pest. Therefore tracking the invasion of this species is recommended. An early detection of this potential pest is decisive for good management of the fields.
