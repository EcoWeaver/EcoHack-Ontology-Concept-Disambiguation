Inversion polymorphism and a new polytene chromosome map of Zaprionus indianus Gupta (1970) (Diptera: Drosophilidae)
Zaprionus indianus is a recent invader in Brazil and was probably introduced from the West Afrotropical zone. So far, studies regarding its chromosomal polymorphism were limited to India. We found that Brazilian populations were very different from Indian ones. Five new inversions have been discovered. In(II)A, already described in India, where it is quite common, has also been found in Brazil, where it is very rare. The X-chromosome has three inversions; In(X)Na, In(X)Ke and In(X)Eg, which are frequent in all Brazilian populations studied. In every case, we observed strong linkage disequilibrium among these gene arrangements. During the primary collection period (2001-2002), we noticed a significant positive correlation between the frequency of these inversions and latitude, but this was not confirmed in later investigations. Rearrangement In(IV)EF was also common in all populations, while inversion In(V)B was only found in southern populations. Our data suggest that the founders that recently invaded Brazil were polymorphic for the six inversions observed. The place of origin might be identified more precisely by investigating West African populations. In order to facilitate further investigations, we present an updated polytene chromosome photomap, locating the breakpoints of every inversion observed in Brazilian populations.
