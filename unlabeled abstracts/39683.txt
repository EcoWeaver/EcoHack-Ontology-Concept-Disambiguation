Prediction of spatial distribution of invasive alien pests in two-dimensional systems based on a discrete time model
Preventing and managing the invasion of alien species poses significant challenges. In this article, we studied the population density of invasive alien pests based on a discrete time model, and found a new type of pattern and a new type of pattern formation mechanism. This new pattern is caused by the uncertainty of two states in the system (caused by chaos), which is different from the Turing instability. At last, the formation conditions of the irregular speckle pattern were quantitatively analyzed. We believe that the findings of this paper can provide theoretical guidance for the prevention and management of the invasion of alien pests.
