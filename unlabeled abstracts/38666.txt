The role of competition and herbivory in biotic resistance against invaders: a synergistic effect
Invasive species pose a major threat to global diversity and once they are well established their eradication typically becomes unfeasible. However, certain natural mechanisms can increase the resistance of native communities to invaders and can be used to guide effective management policies. Both competition and herbivory have been identified as potential biotic resistance mechanisms that can limit plant invasiveness but it is still under debate to what extent they might be effective against well-established invaders. Surprisingly, whereas biotic mechanisms are known to strongly interact, most studies up to date have examined single biotic mechanisms separately, which likely influences our understanding of the strength and effectiveness of biotic resistance against invaders. Here we use long-term field data, benthic assemblage sampling and exclusion experiments to assess the effect of native assemblage complexity and herbivory on the invasion dynamics of a successful invasive species, the alga Caulerpa cylindracea. A higher complexity of the native algal assemblage limited C. cylindracea invasion, probably through competition by canopy-forming and erect algae. Additionally, high herbivory pressure by the fish Sarpa salpa reduced C. cylindracea abundance by more than 4 times. However, long-term data of the invasion reflects that biotic resistance strength can vary across the invasion process and it is only where high assemblage complexity is concomitant with high herbivory pressure, that the most significant limitation is observed (synergistic effect). Overall, the findings reported in this study highlight that neglecting the interactions between biotic mechanisms during invasive processes and restricting the studied time scales may lead to underestimations of the true capacity of native assemblages to develop resistance to invaders.
