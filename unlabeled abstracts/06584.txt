Isolation and characterization of microsatellite markers for a worldwide invasive weed, Chromolaena odorata (Asteraceae).
Unlabelled: Premise of the study: Microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized for a worldwide invasive weed Chromolaena odorata (Asteraceae) to elucidate the population genetic structure and invasive history. * Methods and results: A total of 14 microsatellite primer pairs were developed using the Fast Isolation by AFLP of Sequences Containing repeats (FIASCO) protocol, and their polymorphism was assessed in two natural populations of C. odorata from Mexico and Trinidad and Tobago. Eleven loci showed polymorphism and eight of these loci were successfully amplified in Ageratina adenophora, another invasive weed related to C. odorata. * Conclusions: These microsatellite markers are useful for investigating the population genetic structure and the history of range expansion of these invasive species.
