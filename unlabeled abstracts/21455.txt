Biology, ecology and trials of potential methods for control of the introduced ascidian Eudistoma elongatum (Herdman, 1886) in Northland, New Zealand
The Australian native colonial ascidian Eudistoma elongatum has spread throughout harbours and oyster farms in Northland, New Zealand. This paper summarizes results of a study on the biology, ecology and potential methods of control of this recently introduced species. Colonies were reproductive for nine months of the year and embryos were present in zooids at water temperatures above 14 degrees C. Low salinity was most likely the cause of variation in reproductive status observed. Larvae were able to swim for up to 6 hours, and remain viable at temperatures as low as 10 degrees C at salinities above 20 psu. Only acetic acid was effective at killing colonies. Control using heat or other chemicals was not feasible for shallow subtidal populations identified in the study. E. elongatum has the potential to spread further within already occupied harbours, and to more southern harbours in New Zealand.
