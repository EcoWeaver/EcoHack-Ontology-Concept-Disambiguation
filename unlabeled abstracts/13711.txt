Dissolved ions mediate body mass gain and predatory response of an invasive fish
Ecological impacts of invasive species are mediated by the environmental characteristics of the invaded habitats. The invasive round goby Neogobius melanostomus is a brackish-water adapted invader with high predatory and competitive impacts on native communities. We test the hypothesis that both body mass gain and predation rates of the round goby are reduced in low-dissolved ion waters in which they can establish, using calcium (Ca2+) as a focal ion of great importance to the physiology of aquatic animals. Round gobies were first acclimated for 36 days on a diet of shrimp pellets in either high (35 mg L-1) or low (12 mg L-1) Ca2+ concentration [Ca]. We then assessed the functional response (FR)--the relationship between predation rate and prey supply--of the round goby from high and low [Ca] on amphipod prey in either condition. Round gobies in high [Ca] consumed more pellets during the acclimation period and gained more mass compared to fish in low-[Ca] conditions. Functional response experiments revealed that round gobies at high-[Ca] levels for both acclimation and FR experiments had the highest predatory impact, whereas fish in low-[Ca] FR treatments had similarly low predation rates regardless of acclimation [Ca]. In a second experiment, non-acclimated round gobies had a higher FR on mayfly nymph prey at high [Ca] than fish at low-[Ca] levels. Our results indicate that the round goby has stronger ecological impacts in conditions that are more physiologically optimal for the species. Identifying key physico-chemical factors that mediate impacts of invaders would help prioritize habitats for management attention.
