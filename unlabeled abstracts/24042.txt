Reproductive ecology ofRhodomyrtus tomentosa(Myrtaceae)
Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Ait.) Hassk. is widely distributed in tropical Asia and is an invasive species in Florida, USA. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the reproductive ecology of the species in order to provide information that may be useful in elucidating factors contributing to its invasiveness. The research was carried out at Heshan Hilly Land Integrated Experimental Station, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangdong Province, China in 2003 and 2004. Rhodomyrtus tomentosa flowers in March or April and the flowering period lasts for about 3 months. Flowers open early in the morning and last 2-3 days. The pollen remain viable for about 12 h and the stigma is only receptive on the blooming day. The breeding system is a mixed mating system (outcrossing and geitonogamy). The species is bee-pollinated with pollen as the floral reward. Almost all pollinators appeared before 12 am. Amegilla florea (Smith) Brooks and Xylocopa nasalis Westwood are the primary pollinators for the species. The results indicate that the reproductive features of R. tomentosa - with the mixed mating system and common generalist pollinators - are not limiting factors when colonization occurs in a new environment.
