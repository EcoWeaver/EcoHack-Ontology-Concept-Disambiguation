Helminth parasites of an introduced invasive carnivore species, the raccoon ( Procyon lotor L.), from the Warta Mouth National Park (Poland).
We evaluated helminth parasites of the introduced North American raccoon ( Procyon lotor L.) in Poland. From June 2006 to May 2007, 91 raccoon fecal samples were collected in the Warta Mouth National Park situated in western Poland near the Polish-German border. Coprological analyses involved flotation and sedimentation. In total, 7 helminth taxa were identified in the feces: Ancylostoma spp., Baylisascaris procyonis, Capillariidae, Placoconus lotoris, Spirocerca lupi, Strongyloides procyonis, and Echinostoma sp. The parasite assemblage in the raccoon exhibited a low diversity. The results were compared with data from other European and North American studies and suggest a lower prevalence of parasites in newly invaded areas, compared with earlier invaded areas or the native range.
