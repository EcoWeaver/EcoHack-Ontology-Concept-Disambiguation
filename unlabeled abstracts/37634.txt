Callosobruchus phaseoli (Gyllenhal, 1833) (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae): a new invasive species in Kazakhstan
An invasive seed-beetle species cowpea weevil Callosobruchus phaseoli (Gyllenhal, 1833), was found in the south-eastern Kazakhstan (Almaty city) for the first time. Its areal includes India (species origin), South and Central America, Europe, Middle East (Israel), North Africa, Arabian Peninsula, Far East, China, Japan, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Burma, Philippines, Hawaiian Islands, Australia, and Oceania. Damaged plants are adzuki bean Vigna angularis (Willd.) Ohwi &amp; H. Ohashi (1969), mung bean Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek, broad bean Vicia faba Linnaeus, 1753, pea Pisum sativum Linnaeus, 1753, pigeon pea Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth, 1893, hyacinth bean Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet, 1826, Wisteria sp., lima bean Phaseolus lunatus Linnaeus, 1753, common bean Phaseolus vulgaris Linnaeus, 1753 and other species of beans, chickpea Cicer arietinum Linnaeus, 1753, Sesbania sp., rattlepod Crotalaria spectabilis Roth., lupine Lupinus sp. Emerged beetles immediately mate and begin to lay eggs on the same day. Beetle damage both in field and in storage. We were not able to find the species during the monitoring of agriculture lands and natural landscapes near the city. We assumed that the invasion occurred recently and the species did not have time to spread outside Almaty. Since C. phaseoli was discovered in Almaty, which is a transit crossroad for many trade routes, further species distribution should be predicted. The most probable corridor for further invasion of cowpea weevil in Kazakhstan is the south and southeast parts of the country, namely Almaty, Zhambyl, Turkestan, and Kyzylorda oblast's.
