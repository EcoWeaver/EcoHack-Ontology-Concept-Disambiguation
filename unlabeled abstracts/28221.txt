Accounting for recorder effort in the detection of range shifts from historical data
1. Climate-induced range shifts have been detected in a large number of plant and animal taxa and a significant portion of these shifts have been found using records collected over a long period of time. However, the absence of standardized collecting procedures in some historical data sets introduces bias and skew into the data which can result in misleading conclusions. A range of different methods has been employed to account for this heterogeneity, but these methods have yet to be compared using a single data set.
