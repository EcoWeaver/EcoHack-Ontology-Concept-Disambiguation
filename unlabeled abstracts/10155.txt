Rehabilitation of Lake Ontario: the Role of Nutrient Reduction and Food Web Dynamics
The Laurentian Great Lakes have a complex history of changes due to eutrophication, invasion of exotic species, and fisheries and phosphorus management practices. Remedial actions have reduced nutrient loadings and enhanced the role of food web interactions in improving water quality. Workshops sponsored through the United States - Canada international Joint Commission have addressed the relative importance of nutrient abatement and/or food web manipulation in affecting water quality trends. Both controls have combined to enhance water clarity in Lake Michigan. Lake Ontario has already exhibited the effects of nutrient controls and may be on the verge of manifesting food web controls. Research and monitoring recommendations to elucidate the effects of nutrient and food web controls include the following: (1) water quality and fisheries agencies must coordinate monitoring activities, standardize techniques, and establish and maintain long-term data sets to evaluate the effects of water quality and fisheries programs separately and together; (2) controlled, mesoscale, whole-system experiments should be performed to quantify rates (e.g. growth, predation, etc.) of food web interactions; and (3) the scientific community should promote research which quantifies the impact of changes in food web dynamics on changes in toxic substance levels in Great Lakes fishes.
