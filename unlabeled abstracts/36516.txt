Impact of invasive quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, Bivalva: Dreissenidae) on the macroinvertebrate community structure of a UK river
The arrival of invasive quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) to the UK necessitates rapid study to evaluate its impact on benthic community structure where colonisation has occurred. In the Wraysbury River (west London), impact on benthic invertebrate community structure by invasion of quagga mussel was measured by comparing a series of invaded and uninvaded study sites over an annual period of monthly sampling. It was apparent that despite quagga mussel consistently forming a large proportion of stream biomass in invaded sites, community taxon richness and composition did not vary significantly in comparison to uninvaded sites. Similarly, total community biomass and density when excluding quagga mussel was mostly homogeneous across the study reach, with the exception of one site with the highest quagga mussel biomass and density. If quagga mussel biomass and density increased over time to levels found at this site, more significant changes to native community structure might be expected. This study represents a first benchmark for understanding the progression and impacts of quagga mussel invasion in UK rivers and these results will be essential for comparison in evaluating future change and impacts.
