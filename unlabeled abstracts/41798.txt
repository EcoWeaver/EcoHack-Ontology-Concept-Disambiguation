Reductive roasting of cathode powder of spent ternary lithium-ion battery by pyrolysis of invasive plant Crofton weed
Recycling spent lithium-ion batteries has received wide attention because the spent 15 batteries are hazardous and contain high-grade and catalytic active heavy metals. Reductive 16 roasting is an effective pretreatment method to recover valuable metals from the used batteries. 17 In this paper, Crofton weed, which has been defined as an invasive plant in China, was 18 suggested as a biomass pyrolysis additive for the reducing pretreatment of spent lithium-ion 19 batteries powder (LiNi 0.6 Co 0.2 Mn 0.2 O 2). The process can reduce carbon consumption for the 20 spent battery recycling industry. Meanwhile, the Ni, Co, and other metals in the cathode powder 21 could catalyze biomass pyrolysis, reducing the reaction's activation energy. The effects of 22 temperature, biomass ratio, and roasting retention time on the reduction were studied. TG-DSC, This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed.

Under the optimum roasting conditions: temperature 800, biomass 25 ratio 30%, Li in the powder is converted into Li 2 CO 3 , and the high valence Ni, Co, Mn are 26 reduced to low valence and easily soluble Ni, Co, and MnO, respectively. This method provided 27 an alternative technology solution for both spent lithium-ion battery treatment and controlling 28 invasive plants in China, namely Crofton weed. 29
