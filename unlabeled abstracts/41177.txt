Population dynamics and management strategies for the invasive African Catfish Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822) in the Western Ghats hotspot
The African sharp-tooth catfish, Clarias gariepinus has caused significant negative impacts on freshwater biodiversity, especially in the developing world. An assessment of the demographics of an invasive C. gariepinus population from a freshwater Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) site in Southern India, revealed high growth rate, low fishing mortality and year-round recruitment as major driving factors aiding its successful establishment. Modelling of population dynamics using virtual population analysis and yield per recruit suggests that, while capturing larger individuals can help reduce population, eradication of the species is possible only by targeting small-sized, immature fish (<10 cm).
