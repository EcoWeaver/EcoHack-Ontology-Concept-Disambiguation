Vegetative regeneration in invasive Reynoutria (Polygonaceae) taxa: the determinant of invasibility at the genotype level
Vegetative regeneration of individual genotypes of Asian Reynoutria taxa, which are invasive in the Czech Republic, was studied in R. sachalinensis (five genotypes), R. japonica (a single genotype present in the country), and their hybrid R. xbohemica (nine genotypes). Identity of genotypes was confirmed by isozyme analysis. Ten rhizome segments of each genotype were planted in a randomized block design. After 30 d, the regeneration rate of each genotype was measured as the proportion of rhizomes that produced shoots. Emergence time and final mass of each shoot were recorded. The regeneration rate and final shoot mass were significantly affected by genotype in R. xbohemica but not in R. sachalinensis. In R. xbohemica, easily regenerating genotypes grew faster. Regeneration characteristics that crucially contribute to the fitness of these vegetatively spreading plants are closely related to each other. In genotypes with a low regeneration rate, early-emerging shoots produced more biomass, while in those with a high regeneration rate, shoot mass was independent of emergence time. Mean clone size recorded in the field was marginally significantly related to emergence time during regeneration; regeneration characteristics might thus affect the extent of R. xbohemica invasion at a regional scale. Hybrids genetically intermediate between the parents regenerated better than those closely related to parents. Novel hybrid invasive genotypes may be produced by rare sexual reproduction, fixed by clonal growth, and present a previously unknown threat to native vegetation.
