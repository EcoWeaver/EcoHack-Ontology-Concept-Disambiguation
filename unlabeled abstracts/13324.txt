First records of Freshwater Bivalves of Ilha Grande National Park, Parana, Brazil
The Ilha Grande National Park, Parana, Brazil, is located in the Upper Parana River and has characteristics typical of a floodplains. This protected area includes lagoons connected and disconnected to the Parana River, although the latter also connect during periods of high water level, thus composing a heterogeneous group of lacustrine environments. The enormous potential the flora and fauna diversities are still little known to the region, as can be seen through benthic invertebrates, inclunding bivalves mollusks. The granulometric composition of these floodplain lagoons was formed mainly by mud and very fine sand. Furthermore, organic matter composition was predominantly of fine particulate. The other abiotic factors differed from lagoons located within the island of the park to those located in the left margin of Parana River. The results demonstrated the importance of abiotic factors such as the physical composition of granulometric texture, organic matter and macrophyte banks, to the establishment of bivalves in these floodplain lagoons. We recorded bivalves of Pisidium (native), Diplodon (native), and Corbicula (invasive). The highest values of Diplodon sp. density were observed at Sao Joao/C lake, for Pisidium sterkianum (Pilsbry, 1897) at Sao Joao/M lake, and to Jatoba/C lagoon with high density of invasive species Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774). This study to obtain conduct the first records of freshwater bivalves in floodplains lagoon in the Ilha Grande National Park, and provides contributions to better understanding the ecology of these mollusks. The recording of native species in the region of Upper Parana River floodplain after a lomg period without new records, demonstrated the importance of protecting the lagoons of the Ilha Grande National Park as they can be a possible refuge to some species of native freshwater bivalves.
