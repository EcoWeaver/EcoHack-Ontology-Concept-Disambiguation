Distribution of Invasive Species of Ambrosia L. Genus in the South Urals (Republic of Bashkortostan)
The study presents data on invasive neophytes of North American origin of Ambrosia L. genus (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., A. trifida L., and A. psylostachya DC.) progressing in the Republic of Bashkortostan and posing a threat to ecosystems of the South Urals region. Out of the three Ambrosia species, the greatest number of invasion centers (over 60) has been registered for A. trifida; the number of A. psylostachya localities is considerably lower, while A. artemisiifolia has not naturalized in ecosystems of the region and occurs sporadically. Maps of secondary ranges of the invasive species belonging to Ambrosia genus in the Republic of Bashkortostan have been produced.
