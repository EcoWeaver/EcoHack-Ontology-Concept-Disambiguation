Effects of Invasive, Non-Indigenous Plant Species on Ecosystem Processes: Lessons from Florida
Individual plant species that modify ecosystem properties have traditionally been thought to be uncommon in natural systems. I hypothesise that many invasive non-indigenous do alter these proerties at several scales. The non-indigenous plant species in Florida considered to be the most invasive by the Florida Pest Plant Council are examined for this capability through review of the available literature. Out of 31 species total, 12-20 (39-64%) potentially alter the the ecosystem properties of geomorphology, hydrology, biogeochemistry and disturbance. When population-level properties that indicate superior competitive ability of the invading species are examined, 13-24 (42-77%) of the species are included, with a majority of the species showing traits capable of modifying natural ecosystems at ecosystem and community/population scales. This review suggests that ecosystem alteration may be relatively common among invasive non-ibdigenous species. However, much of the current information is anecdotal. Empirical studies directly examining the effects of species on ecosystem and smaller scale processes are necessary, and highly invasive species may be particularly appropriate for such research. Further, as non-indigenous species homogenise the global flora, they may also homogenise the local flora by increasing the representation of ruderal species. Where ecosystem properties have been altered, site restoration likely will require control of both the invader(s) and recovery of processes.
