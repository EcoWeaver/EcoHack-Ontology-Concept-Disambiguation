Larvae of the exotic predatory ladybird Platynaspidius maculosus (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) on citrus trees: prey aphid species and behavioral interactions with aphid-attending ants in Japan
An aphidophagous ladybird, Platynaspidius maculosus (Weise) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), is originally distributed in China, Taiwan, and Vietnam. The ladybird has recently intruded into the southern and central parts of Japan. The present study found that the larvae of this ladybird preyed on three aphid species, Aphis spiraecola, Aphis gossypii, and Toxoptera citricidus (all Hemiptera: Aphididae), feeding on young shoots of various Citrus species in August to early October in Shizuoka Prefecture, central Japan. Laboratory rearing of the sampled larvae confirmed that the larvae completed their development (adult emergence) by consuming each of the three aphid species. The ladybird larvae were observed foraging in aphid colonies attended by one of the four ants, Lasius japonicus, Pristomyrmex punctatus, Formica japonica, and Camponotus japonicus (all Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Field observations revealed that the foraging/feeding larvae were almost completely ignored by honeydew-collecting ants even when they physically contacted each other. Thus, in Japan, the larvae of the exotic ladybird exploit colonies of the three aphid species attended by one of the four ant species on many Citrus species. On the basis of the results, I discuss the possibility of the ladybird's reproduction on citrus trees in Japan, probable adaptations of the ladybird larvae to aphid-attending ants, and potential impacts of the ladybird on native insect enemies attacking ant-attended aphids on citrus.
