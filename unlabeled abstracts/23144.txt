Applied conservation services of the evolutionary theory
Having quantitative data to use in a reliable model in conservation can be extremely limiting because of the usual scarcity of such information. The body of theory accumulated so far in evolutionary ecology, and particularly in the evolution of life-history traits, can also come in the aid of conservation practitioners and provide them with some help in the absence of quantitative data. Although some attempts have been made already to bridge the gap between evolution and applied conservation, this interface remains to be properly delineated. Here we present a diverse number of examples of the applicability of evolutionary knowledge to the effective solution of diverse applied conservation problems. We first deal with the opposed strategies of animal and plant species inhabiting survival versus reproduction habitats, and the most adequate management approaches in both cases, with special emphasis in assessing the risks of supplementing food and nest boxes for conservation purposes. Secondly, we deal with invasion biology and suggest that a better understanding of the problem of biological invasions, and a better management of it, is gained if the focus is moved from invasive species characteristics to the properties of the invaded community from an evolutionary perspective. Finally, we show how the management of complex predator-prey interactions can benefit from the application of knowledge on life-history evolution and discuss the particularities of culling programs applied either to short-lived or long-lived species in order to be effective.
