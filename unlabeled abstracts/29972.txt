Beetle responses to artificial gaps in an oceanic island forest: implications for invasive tree management to conserve endemic species diversity
Natural forests are often replaced by invasive alien trees on isolated oceanic islands. Adequate eradication of invasive trees should be conducted with the goal of biodiversity conservation, because islands support many endemic organisms that depend on native forests. An invasive alien tree, Bischofia javanica Blume (Euphorbiaceae), has invaded and replaced natural forests on the oceanic Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, Japan, in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. To determine how the removal of B. javanica trees affects insect diversity, we examined flying beetles captured using Malaise traps in B. javanica forests on Hahajima. The abundance, species density, and species composition of wood-boring beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae, Elateridae, Mordellidae, and Scolytidae) were compared between closed-canopy sites and gaps created by girdling B. javanica trees in alien forests during two seasons (June-July and October-November 2005). Of the collected beetles, 75.8, 87.5, 90.0, and 0.0% of cerambycid, elaterid, mordellid, and scolytid beetle species, respectively, were endemic to the Ogasawara Islands. More cerambycid, elaterid, and mordellid individuals were captured in June-July than in October-November; the number of scolytid individuals did not differ between seasons. More cerambycid, elaterid, and scolytid individuals were captured in artificial gaps than on the closed-canopy forest floor. Although fewer mordellid individuals were captured in gaps, more endemic mordellids were captured in gaps. More cerambycid and scolytid species were captured in artificial gaps than in closed-canopy areas. The positive responses of beetles to artificial gaps suggest that the removal of B. javanica increases beetle diversity and the abundance of endemic beetles.
