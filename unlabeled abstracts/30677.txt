Population genomics ofSaccharomyces cerevisiaehuman isolates: passengers, colonizers, invaders.
The quest for the ecological niches ofSaccharomyces cerevisiaeranged from wineries to oaks and more recently to the gut of Crabro Wasps. Here we propose the role of the human gut in shapingS. cerevisiaeevolution, presenting the genetic structure of a previously unknown population of yeasts, associated with Crohn?s disease, providing evidence for clonal expansion within human?s gut. To understand the role of immune function in the human-yeast interaction we classified strains according to their immunomodulatory properties, discovering a set of genetically homogeneous isolates, capable of inducing anti-inflammatory signals via regulatory T cells proliferation, and on the contrary, a positive association between strain mosaicism and ability to elicit inflammatory, IL-17 driven, immune responses. The approach integrating genomics with immune phenotyping showed selection on genes involved in sporulation and cell wall remodeling as central for the evolution ofS. cerevisiaeCrohn?s strains from passengers to commensals to potential pathogens.
