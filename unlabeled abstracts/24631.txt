The generation of diversity in systems of patches and ranked dominance
Aim Mac Nally and Lake proposed a statistic (e) for determining whether the diversity in archipelagos is better generated by several small patches (SS-dominance) or by a few large patches (SL-dominance). The e statistic improves the study of the generation of diversity in systems of patches, but the dependence of e on a particular species-area relationship may reduce its effectiveness. In this paper we show that e may be affected by the criterion used to distinguish between large and small patches. We propose alternative measures (ranked m-dominance indices) for the detection of SS/SL dominance, which separate the effects of each class of patch size on the generation of diversity.
