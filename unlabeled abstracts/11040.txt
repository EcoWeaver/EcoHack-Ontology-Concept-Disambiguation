Grateloupia turuturu (Halymeniaceae, Rhodophyta) is the correct name of the non-native species in the Atlantic known as Grateloupia doryphora
Grateloupia doryphora (Montagne) Howe, originally described from Peru, has repeatedly been reported as an invasive species in Atlantic and Mediterranean waters. Various attempts to explain this species ' route of introduction have been unsatisfactory. New evidence from comparative rbcL sequence analysis and morphology suggests that this adventive species in the NE and NW Atlantic corresponds with G. turuturu Yamada, originally described from Japan. This provenance follows a well-recognized trend of invasive marine organisms that have colonized the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea from Pacific NE Asia.
