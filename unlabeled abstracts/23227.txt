The importance of fine-scale savanna heterogeneity for reptiles and small mammals
Tropical savannas are an important reservoir of global biodiversity. Australia's extensive savannas, although still largely intact, are experiencing substantial declines in terrestrial biodiversity due to a variety of interrelated effects of altered fire regimes, grazing and increases in invasive species. These disturbance processes are spatially variable, combine to increase landscape to local-scale landscape heterogeneity, but rarely result in well-defined patch boundaries. We quantified the importance of this heterogeneity for native reptile and small mammal species in a tropical savanna landscape of Queensland, Australia. We used high resolution remote sensing imagery (IKONOS) to map habitat pattern at a 4 m spatial resolution and at variable extents. We found that landscapes dominated by grass or bare ground had low reptile and small mammal diversity, while landscapes with a heterogeneous mix of grass, bare ground and trees had high species diversity and relative abundance of most species. Landscape heterogeneity may increase reptile and small mammal species richness by: (i) increasing the variety and abundance of foraging resources such as seeds and invertebrates; (ii) providing cover from predators and high summer temperatures; and (iii) increasing functional connectivity and dispersal success. The importance of these resources and processes varies among individual species and at different spatial scales, reiterating the need to consider habitat requirements of multiple species in landscape management and conservation planning.
