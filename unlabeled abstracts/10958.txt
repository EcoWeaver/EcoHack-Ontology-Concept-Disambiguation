Characteristics and habitats of non-native plant species in the city of Chonju, southern Korea
Investigations on non-native organisms have become an important task of modern ecology throughout the world. The major objective of this study was to identify the characteristics and habitats of non-native plant species in Korean cities in order to derive conclusions on the success of biological invaders. The city of Chonju in southwest Korea was selected as a representative investigation area. All wild-growing vascular plants were recorded in the city on a total of 106 sample plots located in representative land-use types and within various distances of the city center. Frequency, origin, life forms, and plant families of non-native species were analyzed. Additionally, the percentage of non-native species along a gradient from the city center to the outskirts was investigated. We found that most common non-native species of the flora of Chonju are: (i) native to the Northern hemisphere; (ii) belong to the annuals; (iii) belong to the plant families of the Compositae or Leguminosae; and (iv) they perform best on sites that are continuously disturbed by human impact. In conclusion, non-native species play a significant role in enhancing biological diversity in urban areas.
