Identification and assessment of invasive plant species at Bogor Botanic Gardens, Indonesia
Abstract Alien plant species were introduced to Indonesia for cultivation, experimental and curiosities, or a Botanic Garden's collection. Those alien species could also be imported through plant propagules infecting imported agricultural products. The species could be useful or have a possibility as invasive. A Botanic Garden collects documented plant species for conservation, research, environmental education, ecotourism, and ecosystem services. Bogor Botanic Garden was established in 1817 and has many plant collections not only from Indonesia but also from many other countries of the world. This study aims to identify the invasive plants as a collection of Bogor BG, characterise, and assess the plants to reduce the risk. There were 69 invasive species with a total of 262 plants collected in the garden, with the habit form of climber, tree, shrub, herb, clump, fern and aquatic. The source of the invasive plants was only from outside Indonesia (19 species), only from Indonesia (36 species), or both sources (14 species). The native of the invasive species was Indonesia (26 species), out of Indonesia (37 species) or unknown (6 species). The characteristic of invasiveness of the plant species is very important as an input for further risk analysing of invasive plant of the garden and for managing the plants of Botanic Gardens in the future time.
