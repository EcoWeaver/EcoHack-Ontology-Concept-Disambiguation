Invasion biology of the Chinese mitten crab Eriochier sinensis: A brief review
The Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis is a native of freshwater and estuarine habitats along the east coast of Asia. Invasive populations have existed in northern Europe since the early 20th century, and more recently a breeding population has become established in the San Francisco Bay system along the west coast of North America. Ballast water is the most probable vector for both invasions, although there is also potential for escape from ethnic markets and from the ornamental aquarium industry. Invasive populations of mitten crabs have caused millions of dollars in economic and ecological damage. Economic impacts center largely on the burrowing activity of the crabs, which damages stream banks and levees, and the annual spawning migration, which interferes with fishing activities and irrigation projects. Chinese mitten crabs have recently appeared in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays on the east coast of the USA, and there are confirmed reports of breeding females in both estuaries. The potential for large populations of mitten crabs in these estuaries has not been determined. This paper presents a review of the biology and ecology of native and invasive populations of the species and provides recommendations for research relevant to the prediction of future mitten crab invasions.
