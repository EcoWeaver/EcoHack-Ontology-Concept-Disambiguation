Phylogeography of the Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda) in the northern Mediterranean: the combined effects of historical vicariance, population expansion, secondary invasion, and isolation by distance
Sequence analysis of the mtDNA control region of four samples (n=195) of Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda) collected along the northern Mediterranean reveals two clades about 8.1% divergent distributed in an east-west cline that fits an isolation by distance (IBD) model. The vicariant origin of this genetic discontinuity is proposed, supported in addition to the cline, by evidence of distinct historical demographic factors affecting each clade. Variation in Clade I suggests a large stable population, whereas Clade II displays a star-like phylogeny indicative of a population bottleneck followed by sudden expansion. The historical demography and biogeographic scenario is as follows: (1) Allopatric isolation during the Pleistocene give rise to Clade I (Atlantic) and Clade II (Mediterranean); (2) Population collapse followed by sudden expansion gives rise to the characteristic star-like phylogeny of Clade II; (3) Secondary contact as Clade I enters from the Atlantic, and (4) An east-west cline is maintained by IBD.
