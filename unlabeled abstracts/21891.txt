Relationship between phenotypic traits and selected fitness components ofDiabrotica virgifera virgifera
Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is one of the most important and best-studied maize pests, yet little information is available regarding the basic relationships among its phenotypic traits, particularly those that reflect the overall fitness of this successful invader in Europe and North America. Such information is critical for studies on the invasiveness, behavioural ecology, and management of this pest. Phenotypic traits that change over the lifetime of the beetle were investigated (e.g., fresh body weight) as they can indicate changes in adult physiology or fitness of D. v. virgifera. Phenotypic traits that remain stable over the beetle's lifetime were also investigated (e.g., pronotum width, head capsule width, hind tibia length), as they most likely allow detection of genetic differences between populations. Furthermore, phenotypic traits were investigated that may best predict fecundity (e.g., fresh body weight, elytra width) and life span (e.g., elytra length), as these two factors influence the population growth of this highly invasive species. Finally, regression equations are provided for the age-specific oviposition and survival of the long-living D. v. virgifera adults, which may allow researchers to reduce the duration of their bioassays without losing information.
