Biological invasions in aquatic ecosystems in China
In China, aquatic ecosystems have been highly disturbed by the introduction and spread of non-native invasive species. Unfortunately, problems of biological invasions in aquatic ecosystems have been largely overlooked and lessons from known disasters are learned slowly, despite that negative effects are frequently detected and reported. Here, we review the available literature to generate a list of invasive species in aquatic ecosystems in China. We summarize five major negative effects caused by invasive species, including habitat damage, community change, pests of agriculture and aquaculture, biodiversity loss, and genetic pollution/extinction. We discuss three major vectors (aquaculture, shipping, and aquarium and ornamental trades) responsible for the introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species. Finally, we propose and call for management of vectors responsible for the introduction and spread of invasive species in China.
