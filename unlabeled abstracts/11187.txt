A bevy of surgeons: first record of Acanthurus chirurgus (Bloch, 1787) from the central Mediterranean, with notes on other Acanthuridae recorded in the region
The doctorfish Acanthurus chirurgus (Bloch, 1787) is reported for the first time from the central Mediterranean, based on a specimen caught in Maltese waters during August 2016. Since the only previous Mediterranean record of this species was based on a single individual observed in the Tyrrhenian Sea, the present record likely represents an independent introduction that may have occurred through the aquarium trade or via shipping. Two other surgeonfish species, Acanthurus coeruleus Bloch and Schneider, 1801 and Acanthurus monroviae Steindachner, 1876, were previously recorded from the central Mediterranean. While A. coeruleus may have established a population in the Levantine Sea, like A. chirurgus it has only been reported once from Malta (and from the central Mediterranean in general); both A. coeruleus and A. chirurgus are, therefore, considered to be casual species in Maltese waters. In contrast, A. monroviae was reported from several Mediterranean countries including Tunisia and Malta in the central Mediterranean. Here we present several authenticated reports of this species from Maltese waters, which strongly suggest that it has managed to establish a population in this region, although the possibility of multiple introductions cannot be excluded.
