Outbreak propagule pressure influences the landscape spread of a wind-dispersed, epidemic-causing, plant pathogen
Context Factors influencing the early stages of biological invasions, especially how the outbreak conditions project to later patterns of organism spread, is an important but rarely studied aspect of invasion biology. Objectives Our objectives were to determine whether a simple function relates outbreak disease levels and end epidemic magnitude for wheat stripe rust and to evaluate the potential role of propagule pressure. Methods We superimposed data from experimentally initiated wheat stripe rust outbreaks (disease levels ranging from 0.01 to 30 % of the wheat host) in central Oregon, USA on the function relating disease outbreak prevalence to end epidemic magnitude in the simulation program EPIMUL. We also used EPIMUL to assess an alternative hypothesis that wheat stripe rust spread is driven by outbreak area, not propagule number, by varying outbreak area and holding the outbreak disease levels constant. Results A simple power function related outbreak disease levels to end epidemic magnitude and expanse of spread for wheat stripe rust in simulations. When this function was superimposed on field data, there was a tolerable alignment. Simulations suggested that end epidemic magnitude and expanse of disease spread is influenced more by changes in outbreak disease levels than outbreak area. Conclusions The landscape spread of disease epidemics may be projected and reconstructed by the application of a simple power function with outbreak disease levels. Moreover, this relationship may be a useful starting point for projecting and reconstructing the patterns of biological invasions for r-selected species with long-distance dispersal.
