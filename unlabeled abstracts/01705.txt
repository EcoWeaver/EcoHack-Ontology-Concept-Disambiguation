Potential risk levels of invasive Neoleucinodes elegantalis (small tomato borer) in areas optimal for open-field Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) cultivation in the present and under predicted climate change
Background: Neoleucinodes elegantalis is one of the major insect pests of Solanum lycopersicum. Currently N. elegantalis is present only in America and the Caribbean, and is a threat in the world's largest S. lycopersicum producing countries. In terms of potential impact on agriculture, the impact of climate change on insect invasions must be a concern. Currently no research exists regarding the effects of climatic change on risk level of N. elegantalis. The purpose of this study is to develop a model for S. lycopersicum and N. elegantalis utilizing CLIMEX to determine risk levels of N. elegantalis in open field S. lycopersicum cultivation in the present and under projected climate change, using the Global Climate Model, CSIRO-Mk3.0. Results: Large areas are projected to be suitable for N. elegantalis and optimal for open field S. lycopersicum cultivation under current time. However, in the future these areas will become unsuitable for both species. Conversely, in others regions in the future may become optimal for open field S. lycopersicum cultivation with varying risk level for N. elegantalis. Conclusion: The risk levels results presented here provide a useful tool to design strategies to prevent the introduction and establishment of N. elegantalis in open field S. lycopersicum cultivation.
