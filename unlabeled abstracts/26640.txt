Effects of fertiliser and grazing on the arthropod communities of a native grassland in south-eastern Australia
An experiment commenced in 1998 to test the effects of superphosphate fertiliser application and grazing on production and botanical composition of a native grassland in south-eastern Australia. Superphosphate application resulted in an increase in sheep production but a decline in native perennial grasses and an increase in exotic annual grasses. The study reported here aimed to determine if arthropod assemblages showed changes in community composition on the same experimental plots. The experiment was conducted in grassland dominated by the native perennial wallaby grass, Austrodanthonia duttoniana, and consisted of six replicated treatments that were designed to improve grassland and domestic livestock productivity. Treatments consisted of a control (no fertiliser), three levels of annually applied superphosphate (62.5, 125, and 250 kg ha-1), and two treatments aimed to raise soil pH (superphosphate plus lime, and sewage ash). Soil properties were measured annually and sheep stocking rates were increased over the duration of the experiment according to increases in available forage. Soil and ground-active arthropod populations were sampled from all plots in spring 2001. Fertiliser application and grazing increased the relative abundance of introduced Acari and Collembola, and changed the community composition of Formicidae and Coleoptera. Lime and sewage treatments had variable effects on taxa. Improving the productivity of native grassland with superphosphate led to a decline in plant and arthropod biodiversity through reduced abundance and/or local extinction of native species and increased dominance of introduced species. These findings support the need to protect and restore a representative network of native grassland ecosystems within the agricultural zone of south-eastern Australia.
