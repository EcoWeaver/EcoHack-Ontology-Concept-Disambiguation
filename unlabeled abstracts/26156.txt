The Historical and Extant Vascular Flora of Pelham Bay Park, Bronx County, New York 1947-1998
This vascular flora of Pelham Bay Park, Bronx County, New York is based on collections made by H.E. Ahles in 1946-47 and by the authors from March of 1994 through October of 1998. Altogether, 123 families, 471 genera and 956 species are reported here. Of these 956 species, 583 (61.0%) are native, 321 (33.6%) non-native and 52 (5.4%) either planted or introduced and not spreading to any degree. The largest families were the Asteraceae (120 species) and the Poaceae (106 species), and the largest genera were Carex, Polygonum and Aster. The park's current flora is analyzed by habitat and four plant communities are described and discussed. Most of the extant plant species diversity occurs in two habitats: 255 species were found primarily in the woodland community, and 288 species usually occurred in the grassland/meadow community. According to current criteria in New York, 27 native species collected in 1994-98 are considered uncommon, rare, threatened or endangered in the state. The most pernicious non-native species that occur in PBPK are: Acer platanoides, Alliaria petiolata, Ampelopsis brevipedunculata, and Rhamnus frangula. The future of the remaining natural areas of Pelham Bay Park will depend upon the degree biologists make people aware of the significant plant species diversity remaining in New York City's second largest park.
