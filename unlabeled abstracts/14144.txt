A synthesis of marine invasive species research and management in the ROPME Sea Area
The objective of this paper is to review the marine invasive species activities undertaken in the ROPME Sea Area, from early awareness initiatives to recent science and management activities. We searched for results of projects published in the primary scientific literature and in the gray literature published by the International Maritime Organization, and reviewed the presentations and papers contributed to the International Marine Invasive Species Conference held in Muscat, Oman, in February 2014. Finally, we present an outlook of potential activities that could be undertaken to advance management of marine invasive species in the ROPME Sea Area.
