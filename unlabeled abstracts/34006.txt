Rapid identification of the invasive fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) using species-specific primers in multiplex PCR
AbstractThe fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith), is a major pest native to the Americas. A recent invasion of FAWs from Africa eastward to South Asia, the Indochina Peninsula, and mainland China has received much attention due to the considerable economic losses in agriculture. FAWs can rapidly colonise a new area, likely due to the wide range of host plants, good flying capability, and high egg production. Therefore, a convenient, quick, and accurate tool for FAW identification is urgently required to establish a FAW invasion management strategy. In this study, FAW-specific primers were designed to recognise FAWs on the basis of internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1). The results revealed the accurate FAW recognition of the three congeneric species and eight common corn lepidopteran pests, especially at their larval stage. Furthermore, species-specific primers have confirmed their efficacy by using 69 FAW specimens from Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States, with a 96% success rate, excluding 3 decayed specimens. By using the simple, reliable, and convenient FAW-specific primers, a pest management programme can be developed not only to reduce sequencing costs and experimental time from 2 days to 4 h, but eradicate the FAW as soon as it enters a new area.
