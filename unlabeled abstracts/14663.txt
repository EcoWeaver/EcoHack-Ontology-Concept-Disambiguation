Allochthonous planktonic algae recorded during the last 25 years in Bulgaria and their possible dispersal agents
The results of 25 years of investigations (1990-2014) of the phytoplankton from 161 different Bulgarian water bodies and historical data were analyzed in order to reveal allochthonous algae, including invasive and potential toxin producers. In total, 1393 taxa from 375 genera of algae (except diatoms) were identified. Among them, 548 algae were found only in one locality, and from 241 algae 89 were rare globally, 35 were rare continentally, and 117 were rare in the country. The occasional occurrence could be pointed with a high degree of probability for only 24 taxa and only some of them could continue their development in the "new" habitats or localities. For a few taxa, repeated or multiple introductions are suggested. The results obtained showed the difficulties in the outlining of parenthetic allochthonous algae in cases of so-called common taxa. For 383 algae (including some common ones), "restricted" distribution was proved, which coincided with the main bird migration routes over the country and the Danube River as a main waterway. Therefore, the attempt to identify the transporting agents shows that at first look the most obvious for the dispersal of these autochthonous algae is the role of birds, followed by passive water transport and/or man-made mode of transport.
