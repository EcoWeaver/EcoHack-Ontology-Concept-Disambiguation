The effects of natural and manipulated density regimes on Alliaria petiolata survival, growth and reproduction
Knowledge of the ecology of Alliaria petiolata, an alien invasive species in the USA, is essential to predict the efficacy of introduced biological control agents. Accordingly, we examined the growth and reproduction of second-year A. petiolata rosettes under natural and manipulated density regimes. Plant survival was also studied under natural conditions. Similar survivorship patterns were observed for high- and low-density populations, although survival in the low-density populations was c. 10% higher. Under natural conditions, low-density plants were larger and more fecund, on average, than high-density plants; however, on a per-area basis, high-density populations were much more productive. When plant density was experimentally reduced, average seed production and plant size increased with thinning intensity, suggesting that thinning released plants from intra-specific competition. Additionally, plants in thinned plots were able to recover from past competition and could approach production of the plants in un-thinned lower density plots that had not experienced prior competition. However, seed production per unit area was lower in thinned versus un-thinned plots of the same initial density. Results suggest herbivore-induced plant mortality late in the life cycle, as might occur following the introduction of biological control agents, may reduce the contribution to the A. petiolata seedbank.
