The Relation of Density Regulation to Habitat Specialization, Evolution of a Species' Range, and the Dynamics of Biological Invasions
Prior studies of the evolution of species' niches and ranges have identified the importance of within-population genetic variance, migration rate, and environmental heterogeneity in determining evolutionarily stable patterns of species' range and habitat use. Different combinations of these variables can produce either habitat specialists or generalists and cause either stable range limits or unbounded expansion. We examine the effect of density regulation on a species' range and habitat use within a landscape comprised of two discrete habitats and along continuous environmental gradients. Using the theta-logistic formulation, we demonstrate the following. (1) Spatially uniform density regulation generally weakens gene swamping and opposes habitat specialization and range limitation. (2) The form of density regulation should play an important role in determining whether the equilibrium species' range is limited by gene flow. (3) Even when no long-term limited-range equilibrium occurs, quasi-stable (or even contracting) range limits may be maintained for a long period during the initial phases of an invasion; the length of this period depends on the form of density regulation. (4) The steady state invasion speed in heterogeneous environments depends on the form of density regulation. Implications for the study of biological invasions are discussed, and directions for further exploration are sketched.
