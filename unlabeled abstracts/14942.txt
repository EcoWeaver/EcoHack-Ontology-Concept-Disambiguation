Grass Invasion into Switchgrass Managed for Biomass Energy
Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a C4 perennial grass and is the model herbaceous perennial bioenergy feedstock. Although it is indigenous to North American grasslands east of the Rocky Mountains and has been planted for forage and conservation purposes for more than 75 years, there is concern that switchgrass grown as a biofuel crop could become invasive. Our objective is to report on the invasion of C4 and C3 grasses into the stands of two switchgrass cultivars following 10 years of management for biomass energy under different N and harvest management regimes in eastern Nebraska. Switchgrass stands were invaded by big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis), and other grasses during the 10 years. The greatest invasion by grasses occurred in plots to which 0 N had been applied and with harvests at anthesis. In general, less grass encroachment occurred in plots receiving at least 60 kg of N ha-1 or in plots harvested after frost. There were differences among cultivars with Cave-in-Rock being more resistant to invasion than Trailblazer. There was no observable evidence of switchgrass from this study invading into border areas or adjacent fields after 10 years of management for biomass energy. Results indicate that switchgrass is more likely to be invaded by other grasses than to encroach into native prairies or perennial grasslands seeded on marginally productive cropland in the western Corn Belt of the USA.
