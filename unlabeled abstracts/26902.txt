A comparative study: Assessment of the antioxidant system in the invasive green alga Caulerpa racemosa and some macrophytes from the Mediterranean
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are of great importance in plant metabolism. However, uncontrolled activation of ROS might have deleterious effects in cells. Eleven Mediterranean countries are still under threat of an introduced taxon of Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea. In the present study, it has been aimed to compare the antioxidant status of this highly invasive alga with some Mediterranean macrophytes collected in the same habitat. For this purpose, such antioxidant enzyme activities as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and lipid peroxidation (LPO) as well, levels have been determined in C. racemosa, Cystoseira barbata C. Agardh, Padina pavonica (Linnaeus) Thivy and Enteromorpha sp. The highest SOD, CAT, GSH-Px enzyme activities and the lowest LPO level have been measured in the invasive C. racemosa. In conclusion, C. racemosa var. cylindracea seems more tolerant in warring with ROS than the Mediterranean species tested do. These results could partly explain the amazing success of C. racemosa var. cylindracea introduced in the Mediterranean.
