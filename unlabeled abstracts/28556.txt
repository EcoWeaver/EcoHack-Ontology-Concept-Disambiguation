Alleviation of Summer Drought Boosts Establishment Success of Pinus sylvestris in a Mediterranean Mountain: An Experimental Approach
We performed an irrigation experiment to study the impact of summer drought on Pinus sylvestris establishment at its southernmost distribution limit. Watering was done during the first growing season simulating mesic summer conditions, and we monitored the consequences for survival and growth during the first growing season and the delayed consequences on the second growing season. In addition, we considered the heterogeneity created by the microhabitats, where seeds are found after dispersal (bare soil, under shrubs, and under adult pines). Summer drought was the main mortality factor in all the microhabitats. Watering increased emergence and doubled seedling survival compared to non-watered control sites. Differences were even higher when the cumulative effect on emergence and survival was considered, with an overall recruitment of 22.4% in watered plots vs. 7.9% in control. Irrigation increased growth in bare soil and under shrubs, but had scant effect on growth under pines, suggesting that radiation was the limiting factor in this microhabitat. The positive effect of irrigation on growth parameters persisted during the second growing season despite water was not added the second year, showing delayed consequences of drought on seedling performance. Summer drought thus limits Pinus sylvestris establishment in these southernmost forests by reducing both recruitment and growth. This might lead to the development of a remnant dynamic in these relict populations under the current regional increase in dryness and rainfall variability associated with global warming.
