Beyond ballast water: aquarium and ornamental trades as sources of invasive species in aquatic ecosystems
Although ballast water has received much attention as a source of aquatic invasive species, aquariums and trade in aquarium and ornamental species are emerging as another important source for species likely to invade aquatic habitats.
