Long-term population demographics of native brook trout following manipulative reduction of an invader
Although laboratory studies have provided evidence for negative interactions between brook trout and brown trout, it is unknown how these interactions affect larger scale demographics in a natural setting. We tested the effects of invasive brown trout on brook trout demographics by removing brown trout from a sympatric population using a before-after control-impact study design. The study was conducted across a large stream network for a period of 6 years. Abundance of brook trout increased after brown trout removal primarily as a result of increased recruitment and immigration. Size structure also shifted towards larger individuals as a result of increased growth rates and a decrease in emigration of larger trout. Size at maturity and body condition did not change after brown trout removal. Adult brook trout survival increased during the post-treatment period in both the treatment and control reach. A decrease in flood intensity during the post-treatment time period may have led to increased survival. Adult survival may not be the best metric to use when assessing interactions between trout species, especially when the subordinate species has suitable areas to emigrate.
