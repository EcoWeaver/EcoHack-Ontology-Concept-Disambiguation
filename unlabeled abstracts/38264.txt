First records of a non-native spotted raphael catfish Agamyxis pectinifrons (Cope, 1870) (Siluriformes: Doradidae) in the floodplain of the Grijalva basin
These are the first records of the spotted raphael catfish Agamyxis pectinifrons in a Mexican basin. Three adult specimens, two female and one undetermined, were collected in the floodplain of the Grijalva river near the Metropolitan Zone of Villahermosa. The presence of catfish is likely due to releases by aquarists. Whether this non-native catfish is able to settle and spread in the floodplain of the Grijalva basin is uncertain. If established, this detection will indicate another step in continuous increase in non-native catfish species in Mesoamerican basins dominated originally by native cichlid and poeciliid species.
