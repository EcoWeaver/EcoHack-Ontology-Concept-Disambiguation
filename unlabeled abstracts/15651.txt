Range expansion of an invasive pufferfish, Lagocephalus sceleratus (Actinopterygii: Tetraodontiformes: Tetraodontidae), to the south-western Mediterranean
Representatives of the family Tetraodontidae are marine and estuarine fishes distributed in tropical and subtropical areas of the Atlantic-, Indian-, and Pacific Oceans. This family comprises 26 genera and 189 species (Froese and Pauly 2014), among which nine can be found in the Mediterranean (Akyol et al. 2005, Corsini et al. 2005, Golani et al. 2006), of which seven are non-indigenous (Golani et al. 2002). The genus Lagocephalus is distinguished from other genera of Tetraodontidae by two separate lateral lines, the lower usually on a fold of skin, a caudal peduncle rather narrow, a lunate caudal fin, two nostrils on each side of the snout with more or less developed papilla, and no bony plates on the back. This genus includes four species inhabiting the Mediterranean. Only Lagocephalus lagocephalus (Linnaeus, 1758) is of Atlanto-Mediterranean origin, while the remaining three species: Lagocephalus spadiceus (Richardson, 1845); Lagocephalus suezensis Clark et Gohar, 1953; and Lagocephalus sceleratus (Gmelin, 1789) are Lessepsian migrants, which have penetrated to the Levantine basin by way of the Suez Canal. Lagocephalus sceleratus can be distinguished from all its Mediterranean congeners by the following characters: the regular distribution of spots of equal size along the dorsal area, the absence of spiny rays in the dorsal and anal fins, and the presence of small spinules on the belly and on the dorsal surface extending to the origin of the dorsal fin. The silver-cheeked toadfish, Lagocephalus sceleratus (known also as giant toadfish, silverside blaasop, or spotted rough-backed blowfish), is a reef-associated species, widely distributed in the tropical Indo-West Pacific Ocean (Smith and Heemstra 1986) as well as the Red Sea, and more recently in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean Sea. Its first record was published by Filiz and Er (2004) and it documented a finding from Gokova Bay (southern Aegean Sea, Turkey). The chronologically first observed specimen, however, was captured in 2003, but reported later by Akyol et al. (2005). The previous 1977 record by Mouneimne (1977) was a misidentification of the similar puffer fish Lagocephalus suezensis (see Golani 1996). Soon after its first detection, the species underwent a population explosion in many localities of the Levant Basin such as Israel (Golani and Levy 2005), Turkey (Bilecenoglu et al. 2006), Crete (Kasapidis et al. 2007), and Cyprus (Katsanevakis et al. 2009). In 2011, Halim and Rizkalla (2011) provided concrete evidence of the occurrence of L. sceleratus along the Mediterranean coast of Egypt and considered that this species was first caught in 2008 off Alexandria, becoming abundant soon afterwards, especially along the coasts of the Sinai and off the Nile
