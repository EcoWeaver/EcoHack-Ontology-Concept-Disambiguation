Presence of Artemia franciscana (Branchiopoda, Anostraca) in France: morphological, genetic, and biometric evidence
New parthenogenetic and gonochoristic populations of Artemia were found along the French Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. The taxonomic identity of these new populations was determined based upon: i) an analysis of the variation in the caudal gene, ii) morphology of the penis and frontal knob of male specimens using scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and iii) a principal coordinate analysis of selected biometric traits. This analysis showed that all French gonochoristic populations of Artemia were comprised of the New World species A. franciscana (Kellogg, 1906) and not the Mediterranean native species, A. salina. As well, the parthenogenetic populations of Artemia in France are being rapidly replaced populations by the North America A. franciscana. This is a concern for all the European Atlantic and Mediterranean regions and is another example of a New World invasive species potentially decreasing European biodiversity.
