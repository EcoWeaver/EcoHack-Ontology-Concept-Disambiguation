Relative value of limnological, geographic, and human use variables as predictors of the presence of Bythotrephes longimanus in Canadian Shield lakes
The Eurasian aquatic invader Bythotrephes longimanus has spread rapidly throughout the Great Lakes watershed, particularly in Ontario, Canada, since its introduction in 1982. To date, the documentation of its spread has been largely anecdotal, not the result of planned surveys, so the actual distribution of the invader and the determinants of its distribution in Ontario remain uncertain. We surveyed 193 lakes in south-central Ontario to determine the importance of lake size, lake location, hydrological connection, and various physical, chemical, and human activity parameters in predicting the spread of Bythotrephes within the 1600-lake Muskoka watershed, North America's most heavily invaded lake region. Invaded lakes were larger than uninvaded lakes and had less acidic, more nutrient-poor, clearer waters. Contingency analyses indicated that invaded lakes were more accessible to humans and had more heavily developed shorelines. Shoreline coverage by cottages was the strongest predictor of Bythotrephes presence when all physical, chemical, and human use variables were included in a logistic regression model. Our results support the growing consensus that humans are primarily responsible for the spread of Bythotrephes.
