Lake Bacterial Assemblage Composition Is Sensitive to Biological Disturbance Caused by an Invasive Filter Feeder
Freshwater bacteria play fundamental roles in global elemental cycling and are an intrinsic part of local food webs. Human activities are altering freshwater environments, and much has been learned regarding the sensitivity of bacterial assemblages to a variety of these disturbances. Yet, relatively few studies have focused on how species invasion, which is one of the most important aspects of anthropogenic global change, affects freshwater bacterial assemblages. This study focuses on the impact of invasive dreissenid mussels (IDMs), a globally distributed group of invasive species with large impacts on freshwater phyto- and zooplankton assemblages. We show that IDMs have direct effects on lake bacterioplankton abundance, taxonomic composition, and inferred bacterial functional group representation.
