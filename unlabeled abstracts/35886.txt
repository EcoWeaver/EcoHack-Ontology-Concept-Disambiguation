Potentiality of Bacterial Pathogens Including Invasive Exotic Species as Threat to Indigenous Fish Species
The Indian major carps (viz. Labeo rohita, Catla catla and Cirrhinus mrigala) were chosen as model to study the bacterial load of the fish pathogen, Aeromonas hydrophila upon artificial inoculation. Aeromonas load was detected in the asymptomatic carriers after 30 days of exposure. The results showed significant difference in load among three different species of carps and among fish populations of each species injected with seven different doses individually and also when they interacted among themselves. Duncan's Post Hoc test for homogeneity among these major carps revealed the presence of seven subsets in each, indicating that there is a significant difference in Aeromonas load with respect to all the doses when compared pair-wise. Cirrhinus mrigala showed the highest sensitivity to the bacterial exposure, followed by L. rohita and C. catla. The presence of the pathogen was also confirmed using Duplex PCR technique. Then, the pathogenic potentiality of an exotic species of aeromonad (Aeromonas salmonicida) was compared with the indigenous species of A. hydrophila in a tropical air-breathing fish, Channa punctatus. The seasonal disease occurrence, mortality and survival of adult C. punctatus due to artificial inoculation (4 x 107 cfu ml-1) of both species of aeromonads were investigated. The disease occurrence was more prevalent due to the infection of A. salmonicida than that of A. hydrophila especially in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, clearly reflecting that exotic is more harmful than indigenous species of aeromonads and is a serious concern as a threat to fish in India.
