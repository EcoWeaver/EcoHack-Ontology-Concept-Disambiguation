Analyses with newly developed microsatellite markers elucidate the spread dynamics of Tricellaria inopinata d'Hondt and Occhipinti-Ambrogi, 1985 - a recently established bryozoan along the New England seashore
The majority of bryozoans possess short-lived larvae with limited dispersal potential, yet many species of bryozoans have obtained global distributions. The marine bryozoan Tricellaria inopinata d'Hondt and Occhipinti-Ambrogi, 1985 was first described from specimens collected in 1982 in the Lagoon of Venice, but is thought to be native to the northeast Pacific. By 2009, it could be found in various locales in the eastern Atlantic including Spain, France, England, and Ireland. In 2010, T. inopinata was found for the first time in the western Atlantic in Eel Pond, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and shortly thereafter was collected in several other locales in the area. A newly developed suite of polymorphic microsatellite loci was used to investigate this recent range expansion of T. inopinata in an effort to understand what makes these animals such successful invaders. We examined various aspects of the population genetics of adult colonies collected from four sites in eastern Massachusetts: Eel Pond, Boston Harbor, Marblehead and Gloucester. There was significant genotypic differentiation between all sites. Higher homogeneity between the Eel Pond and Boston Harbor populations, as well as the potential for Eel Pond acting as a source of migrants for Boston Harbor, suggest that Eel Pond was a source population for the Boston Harbor population. In contrast, levels of genotypic differentiation and a lack of migrants suggested that the Marblehead and Gloucester populations likely did not originate from animals in Eel Pond. Thus, the recent range expansion by T. inopinata in the western Atlantic appears to be a result of multiple introduction events.
