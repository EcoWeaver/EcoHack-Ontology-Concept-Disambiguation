Species diversity in native fish community in Japan: comparison between non-invaded and invaded ponds by exotic fish
The relationship between invasions by two exotic fishes (Micropterus salmoides and Lepomis macrochirus) and species diversity in native fish communities was studied in 14 Japanese farm ponds. We found that mean number of species in native fish communities was three times higher in the ponds without the exotic fish than in the ponds with them. Further, negative relationships were observed between abundance of the two exotic fish and the total abundance of native fish communities. Our results suggest that invasions by the two exotic fish caused serious depletion of native fish communities, although another process can also be considered , that is, that ponds with poor native fish communities were prone to colonization by these exotic fish.
