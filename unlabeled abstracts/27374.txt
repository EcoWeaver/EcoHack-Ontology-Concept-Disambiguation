Seasonal dynamics of fish assemblage in a pond canal
The annual dynamics of fish assemblage in a pond-connecting canal of a South Moravian pond aquaculture facility was studied to reveal potential assemblage effects on pond stocks and vice versa. The species richness of fish assemblage and seasonal dynamics of its development were predominantly dependent upon the fish stock of the interconnected ponds (particularly due to escapees during the period of pond harvesting), which contributed to a considerable increase of commercial fish species occurrence. Using a seasonal parameter, the season proved to have a major impact on fish assemblage dynamics (r=-0.71, P<0.001). Spring samples were dominated by commercial fishes of aquaculture origin (mainly Cyprinus carpio). Occurrence of several fish species originating from the wild (bleak, Alburnus alburnus, chub, Leuciscus cephalus and roach, Rutilus rutilus) was also reported. The pond canal was found to be an important reservoir site of persistent survival and potential subsequent spreading of some undesirable alien fishes such as topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva) and gibel carp (Carrasius auratus). Moreover, more attention should be paid to the potential negative impacts of all fishes of aquaculture origin upon the natural ecosystem and to the adverse effects due to the immigration of wild fish into aquaculture pond farming units.
