Tuckerella japonica (Acari: Tuckerellidae) in China and New Zealand: new data and an alternative hypothesis for its route of invasion
The Tuckerellidae is a relatively small family of the Tetranychoidea, with just one genus and 28 species. Beard et al. (2013) hypothesized, after a fascinating historic account of the cultivation and movement of tea, that T. japonica has travelled as tea's hidden companion when tea plants were transported around the world. Here, we examine and develop this hypothesis further, especially regarding the origin of T. japonica and the possible alternative invasion route to New Zealand. We also report new host association for T. japonica in New Zealand.
