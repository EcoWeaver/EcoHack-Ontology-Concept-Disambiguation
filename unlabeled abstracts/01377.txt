Eco-immunology of fish invasions: the role of MHC variation
The relationship between invaders and the pathogens encountered in their new environment can have a large effect on invasion success. Invaders can become free from their natural pathogens and reallocate costly immune resources to growth and reproduction, thereby increasing invasion success. Release from enemies and relaxation of selective pressures could render newly founded populations more variable at immune-related genes, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), particularly when they have different origins. Using rainbow and brown trout, two of the world's most successful fish invaders, we tested the general hypothesis that invaders should display high intrapopulation immunogenetic diversity and interpopulation divergence, due to the interplay between genetic drift and successive waves of genetically divergent introductions. We analysed genetic diversity and signatures of selection at the MHC class II b immune-related locus. In both species, MHC diversity (allelic richness and heterozygosity) for southern hemisphere populations was similar to values reported for populations at their native range. However, MHC functional diversity was limited, and population immunogenetic structuring weaker than that observed using neutral markers. Depleted MHC functional diversity could reflect a decrease in immune response, immune-related assortative mating or selection for resistance to newly encountered parasites. Given that the role of MHC diversity in the survival of these populations remains unclear, depleted functional diversity of invasive salmonids could compromise their long-term persistence. A better understanding of the eco-immunology of invaders may help in managing and preventing the impact of biological invasions, a major cause of loss of biodiversity worldwide.
