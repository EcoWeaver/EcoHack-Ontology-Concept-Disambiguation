Colonization of Fungi and Bacteria in Stumps and Roots of Scots Pine after Thinning and Treatment with Rotstop
The research areas were located in the Pisz Forest District, northeast Poland, in 10-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) plantations, established in 2004 on a clear-cut area. Reforestation was performed without a biological treatment against root pathogens, despite the presence of Heterobasidion annosum and Armillaria ostoyae in roots and stumps of trees growing previously. The aim of this research was to evaluate how thinning and treatment with the biological control agent Rotstop influences bacterial and fungal communities within roots and stumps. Twelve months after thinning, samples were collected from five stumps in each of two seasons, autumn and spring, from stands on two types of site, one previously forested and one agricultural (20 stumps in total). Wood samples were cultured on agar media, and (i) fungi in the upper part of the stump and (ii) in roots and (iii) bacteria in roots were genetically identified. Sequences were genetically identified by comparing sequences with records held in the GenBank database. We found great differences in the frequency of both fungi and bacteria in roots: they were more frequent (i) in healthy stumps compared to stumps infected with pathogens (H. annosum and A. ostoyae), (ii) in postagricultural soil than in forest soil and (iii) after spring rather than autumn biological treatment. The introduced species Phlebiopsis gigantea was only identified in the parts of the stumps which were above ground level. The bacterium Paenibacillus pini was associated with the presence of H. annosum infecting the stumps from the roots side. In areas seriously threatened by root pathogens, biological treatment can play only a limited role. It can spread to the upper part and impede the production of fruitbodies; however, it has no impact on the development of pathogens in deeper root areas.
