Incorporating rainy season and reproductive phenology into the survival and transition rates of the invasive species Sambucus nigra: an approximation with multistate models
AbstractAlthough it has been demonstrated that environmental changes within a year can affect the reproduction, survival, and growth of invasive species, these factors have rarely been incorporated into demographic analyses. Therefore, we applied multistate demographic models (based on capture-recapture animal methods accounting for imperfect detectability of individuals in natural conditions) to evaluate the effects of reproductive phenology and rainy season on the survival and transition/retrogression rates among stage categories of black elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.)--an invasive tree species widely distributed in temperate forests of Europe and America. In the Abies religiosa temperate forest, Mexico City, a multistate demographic model of S. nigra was built using bimonthly censuses during a year. We selected the best-fitting model according to Akaike's information criterion adjusted for small sample sizes (AICc). We determined the response of reproductive phenology of S. nigra to the rainy season for 2 yr through repeatability and phenotypic plasticity indexes. Our results showed that the reproductive phenology of S. nigra has a low repeatability index and a high phenotypic plasticity index. We demonstrated that additive and interactive effects of reproductive phenology and rainy season promote changes in survival and transition/retrogression rates among stage categories. During the rainy season, the survival probability of seedlings and transition probability toward the adult category increased. Therefore, our study represents a significant contribution to the knowledge of the demographic dynamics of invasive species on an intra-annual scale.
