Investigation on the Global Distribution of Invasive Fish Species, Convict Cichlid Amatitlania Nigrofasciata (Perciformes, Cichlidae) Over the Past Years with Emphasis on Iranian Inland Waters
Abstract The aim of this study was to investigate the global distribution of a non-indigenous and invasive fish species, the convict cichlid Amatitlania nigrofasciata, over time, with an emphasis on the inland waters of Iran. The results showed that the distribution range of the convict cichlid was initially based in Central America. Then, the distribution range of this species expanded to parts of North America. Finally, this fish species was introduced to other parts of the world such as Australia, Israel, Italy, Colombia, Germany, Peru, Slovakia, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Iran due to its extensive ability to spread. So far the presence of A. nigrofasciata has been reported in two domestic basins in Iran, namely Hormuz and Namak Lake. This study indicated that the distribution range of this species is not currently wide, but it is likely to expand towards the central plateau and southern parts of Iran.
