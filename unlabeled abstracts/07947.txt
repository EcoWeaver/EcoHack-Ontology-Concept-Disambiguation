The mating flight times of native Apis cerana japonica Radoszkowski and introduced Apis mellifera L in sympatric conditions
The mating flight times of native Apis cerana japonica and introduced A mellifera were compared in the same biotype in Japan. The queen flight times for A cerana japonica and A mellifera were 13.15-17.00 h, 12.15-15.00 h, and those of the drones were 13.15-16.30 h, 11.30-15.00 h, respectively. Both the hive departure and mating flight times of A mellifera were 1.5-2 h earlier than those of A cerana japonica. Successful mating flights of queens occurred between 13.00 and 14.40 h in A mellifera and between 14.45 and 16.35 h in A cerana japonica.
