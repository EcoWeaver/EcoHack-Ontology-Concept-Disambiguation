Realized niche shift during a global biological invasion
Significance Species' distributions result from dispersal and physiological constraints, interactions with other species, and ultimately, evolution. Biological invasions result from the deliberate or accidental movement of species between regions they would not reach through natural dispersal and can cause major conservation, economic, and human health issues. However, invasions also provide fascinating insights into species' distribution limits. We investigate the invasion of the cane toad from South America to Australia by comparing the results of two modeling approaches: one considering physiological constraints and the other considering the joint influences of physiology, dispersal, and biotic interactions. Our findings demonstrate that the cane toad is limited in its native distribution by biotic interactions but, in Australia, is free to fill its climatic potential.
