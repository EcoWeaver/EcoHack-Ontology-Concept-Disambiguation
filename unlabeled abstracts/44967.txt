Historical perspectives on human-assisted biological invasions
Of all the things we have done to the Earth so far, which one is likely to make the most indelible mark? I have been posing this question to students and colleagues for some time, and usually receive one of three reasonable replies: habitat destruction, human overpopulation, or global climate change. Yet as bad as all these maladies are, they are, to some extent, reversible on time scales to which we can relate. The remedies for these problems, despite mammoth cultural and economic obstacles, can be visualized generally in terms of technology and scientific theory. Only the will is lacking. On longer geological and evolutionary time scales, most such human impacts, if corrected soon, would be mere blips, perturbations of the ecosphere that would leave only a few detectable traces in the fossil record a million years hence.
