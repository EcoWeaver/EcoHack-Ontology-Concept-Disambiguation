Invasive Growth of Ailanthus altissima Trees is Associated with a High Rate of Sensitization in Atopic Patients
Purpose: Ailanthus altissima is one of the world's most invasive species with a globally problematic spread. Pollen is dispersed locally and partially airborne. We aimed at investigating if (i) A. altissima pollen can be detected in relevant quantity in the air and if (ii) sensitization to A. altissima can be detected in patients with seasonal exacerbation of atopic diseases. Patients and methods: We recorded distribution of A. altissima in Leipzig, Germany. In 2019 and 2020, pollen was collected with a Hirst-type pollen trap placed on the roof of the University Hospital. Specific IgE investigations were performed in children and adults with history of atopic diseases with deterioration between May and July. We analysed specific IgE for A. altissima, Alternaria sp., birch, grasses, profilins, polcalcins and crossreacting carbohydrates. Results: We found abundant growth of A. altissima and pollen was detected from early June to mid-July with a maximum pollen concentration of 31 pollen/m3. Out of 138 patients (63 female, 69 children/adolescents), 95 (69%) had seasonal allergic rhinitis, 84 (61%) asthma, and 43 (31%) atopic dermatitis. Sensitization to A. altissima was shown in 59 (42%). There were no significant differences between age groups. In 59% of patients sensitized (35/59), there was no sensitization to possibly cross-reacting structures. Conclusion: Sensitization to A. altissima pollen could be detected in 42% of our patients with atopic diseases, suggesting allergenic potential of this neophyte. In the context of further spread with climate change, eradication strategies and population-based sensitization studies are needed.
