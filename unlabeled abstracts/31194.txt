Distribution, abundance and condition of an invasive bivalve (Corbicula fluminea) along an artificial thermal gradient in the St. Lawrence River
The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea has been introduced to lakes and rivers worldwide, but its physiological requirements generally restrict its distribution to water temperatures of >= 2 degC. In north temperate areas of North America, C. fluminea therefore occurs primarily in artificially heated waterbodies. In November 2009, C. fluminea was discovered for the first time in the St. Lawrence River within the thermal discharge plume of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant, in which the species had developed an abundant and persistent population. In summer 2011, the distribution, abundance and body condition of C. fluminea were sampled in sections of the river immediately upstream and for several kilometres downstream of the power plant. The thermal plume extended as far downstream as 4 km, and C. fluminea's population density declined along this distance. A generalized linear mixed model indicated that C. fluminea's local population density was related negatively to water depth and positively to temperature, turbidity and flow velocity, with temperature having the greatest influence. At stations closer to the discharge source, clams were larger and had a higher mean body condition. However, when temperatures exceeded 30 degC in the discharge canal during mid- summer, body condition was maximal outside the canal at 1.5 km downstream of the discharge source. Thus, although the plume provided a winter thermal refuge for C. fluminea, it created a temperature gradient that encompassed both the upper and lower tolerance limits of the species. The C. fluminea population was extirpated during the winter months when normal temperatures were re-established following permanent cessation of power plant activity in December 2012.
