Invasibility Patterns of Knotgrass (Paspalum distichum) in Portuguese Riparian Habitats
Spatial patterns of the exotic riverine knotgrass (Paspalum distichum L.) were examined in Mediterranean river basins in Southwestern Iberia. The major goals of this study were to assess the degree of invasibility of riparian habitats by this species and to determine the influence of environmental factors and human-induced disturbances that this knotgrass has on both the landscape and the habitat scales. The present study demonstrates the ability of knotgrass to invade riparian habitats in Portuguese freshwater ecosystems. However, most of the spatial variation of the knotgrass cover seemed to be driven by local factors, such as fine sediment enrichment and the fragmentation of riparian woods, and by other anthropogenic interferences in relation to both the fluvial system and the surrounding landscape.
