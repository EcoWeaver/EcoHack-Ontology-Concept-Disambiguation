The invasive plant species in the flora of Sakhalin
Abstract The article is devoted to the formation of modern composition of the adventive and the invasive component of flora in Sakhalin Island. More effective expansion of the alien plant species was in the 20th century during the colonization and the scale development of the island's natural recourses. Today there is a new splash of the alien plants drifting due to development of offshore oil and gas projects and intensive traffic flows. As a result, anthropogenic transformations of many years Sakhalin natural landscapes caused the expansion of adventive flora to 240 taxa, where 26 species are the invasive and widespread on the island.
