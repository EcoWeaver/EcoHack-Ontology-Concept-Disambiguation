Replacement of nonnative rainbow trout by nonnative brown trout in the Chitose River system, Hokkaido, northern Japan
In this study, evidence for interspecific interaction was provided by comparing distribution patterns of nonnative rainbow trout Onchorhynchus mykiss and brown trout Salmo trutta between the past and present in the Chitose River system, Hokkaido, northern Japan. O. mykiss was first introduced in 1920 in the Chitose River system and has since successfully established a population. Subsequently, another nonnative salmonid species, S. trutta have expanded the Chitose River system since the early 1980s. At present, S. trutta have replaced O. mykiss in the majority of the Chitose River, although O. mykiss have persisted in areas above migration barriers that prevent S. trutta expansion. In conclusion, the results of this study highlight the role of interspecific interactions between sympatric nonnative species on the establishment and persistence of populations of nonnative species.
