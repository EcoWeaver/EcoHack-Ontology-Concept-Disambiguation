Benthic assemblages of wetlands invaded byTarebia granifera(Lamarck, 1822) (Caenogastropoda: Thiaridae) in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, South Africa
Tarebia granifera is a freshwater/estuarine gastropod invading many tropical and sub-tropical areas around the world. This snail is native to southeast Asia and was accidentally introduced into South Africa during the last decade. The current study investigated shallow-water benthic assemblages of different invaded and uninvaded localities across locations spanning a large range of environmental conditions in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. Using a correlation-based approach, we found that native benthic assemblages were more closely associated with environmental conditions than with densities of T. granifera. However, there were significant negative correlations between T. granifera abundance and Shannon Diversity at two of the invaded locations. This alien species has successfully invaded, and become dominant in, different types of water bodies with different assemblage compositions and physico-chemical characteristics, ranging from freshwater ponds to saline estuaries and lakes.
