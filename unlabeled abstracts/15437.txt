Ambrosia beetle Premnobius cavipennis (Scolytinae: Ipini) carries highly divergent ascomycotan ambrosia fungus, Afroraffaelea ambrosiae gen. nov. et sp. nov. (Ophiostomatales)
Ambrosia beetles and fungi represent an interesting and economically important symbiosis, but the vast majority of ambrosia fungi remain unexplored, hindering research, management of pathogens, and mitigation of invasive species. Beetles in the subtribe Premnobiini are one example of an entire beetle lineage whose fungal symbionts have never been studied. Here, we identify one dominant fungal symbiont of Premnobius cavipennis by using fungus culturing, community sequencing, microtome sectioning and micro-CT scanning of mycangia. Phylogenetic analyses of combined 18S and 28S rDNA and b-tubulin sequences revealed a highly divergent fungal lineage within Ophiostomatales, Afroraffaelea ambrosiae gen. nov. et sp. nov. The newly described fungal lineage represents another origin of the symbiosis within the Kingdom Fungi, adding to our understanding of the geographic ancestry of ambrosia fungi. P. cavipennis possesses pharyngeal mycangia which appear restrictive in fungus selection. This ambrosia beetle-fungus association has remained stable even after invasions into non-native regions.
