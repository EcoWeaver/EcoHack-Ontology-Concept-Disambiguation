Rapid eradication of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) from Santa Cruz Island, California
Eradication of invasive alien species from islands is often necessary to protect native biota. The rapidity in which eradication projects are implemented can help reduce risk they will fail. We describe the eradication of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) from Santa Cruz Island, California, highlighting those control techniques that removed the most pigs and those that removed the last pigs. In 411days, a total of 5036 pigs were removed from the 25,000-ha island. Before the eradication began, the island was fenced into five zones. Within each zone, the same general sequence of control methods was used: trapping (16% of dispatches in 1660 trap-nights); aerial shooting from a helicopter (77% of dispatches in 13,822km of flight path); and then ground-based hunting with trained dogs (5% of dispatches in 1111 hunter-days). Sterilized adult pigs fitted with radio collars were subsequently used to aid in the location of surviving wild pigs and to monitor the success of the project. Female telemetered pigs were more effective than males at locating remaining wild pigs. Only 10% of the last 102 pigs (the last 20 or so present in each fenced zone) were dispatched as a result of being found with a telemetered pig, but telemetered animals were responsible for finding 43% of the very last pigs once normal hunting had ceased. The time taken to eradicate pigs on Santa Cruz Island was about half that taken on a neighbouring island of similar size (Santa Rosa Island) and 12 times as fast as that on Santiago Island (58,465ha), Galapagos Islands. The deliberate sequencing of control methods, using first those that taught surviving pigs the least, and the intensive implementation of those methods, represent important advances in the practice of eradication and so biodiversity conservation.
