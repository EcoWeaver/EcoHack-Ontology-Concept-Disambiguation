Two invasive freshwater snails new to Jordan (Mollusca: Gastropoda)
Two alien freshwater snails are reported from water bodies in the Jordan Valley, Jordan: Pseudoplotia scabra (O. F. Muller, 1774) (Family Thiaridae) was found at two locations, while Pyrgophorus cf. coronatus (L. Pfeiffer, 1840) (Family Cochliopidae) was collected from four sites. P. scabra is considered one of the most successful invasive molluscan species in many parts of the world including the Middle East, and its arrival in Jordan constitutes a threat to the local freshwater molluscan fauna.
