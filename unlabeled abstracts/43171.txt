Forest biosecurity: alien invasive species and vectored organisms
Alien invasive species pose a serious threat to the ecological and economic sustainability of Canada's forests. Recent establishments of invasive insect pests such as the brown spruce longhorn beetle (Tetropium fuscum), Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis), and emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) highlight the risk of alien species to natural and urban forests of Canada. An emerging area of phytosanitary concern for scientists and phytosanitary regulators is the relationship between fungi or other organisms (e.g., nematodes, mites) and their insect vectors. Invasive insects may introduce and vector alien fungal pests or may serve as vectors for native fungi. Conversely, native insects can become vectors of introduced fungi. The diversity of fungi vectored by introduced insect species is poorly understood. Canadian and international strategies to prevent the influx of alien invasive species, to monitor their presence, and to control established populations are discussed. Surveys for better understanding risks posed by vectored fungi will require development of novel survey techniques and diagnostic tools.
