Using population genetic methods to identify the origin of an invasive population and to diagnose cryptic subspecies ofTelchin licus(Lepidoptera: Castniidae)
AbstractTelchin licus, the giant sugarcane borer, is an important pest species of sugarcane in northeast Brazil. Four subspecies ofTelchin licusare recognized in Brazil based on their geographic distribution and subtle differences in wing colour pattern. Some taxa are morphologically indistinguishable, and their accurate identification is key to their efficient control. Mitochondrial genes sequences (cytochrome oxidaseI and subunit 6 of thenicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase) were applied to delimit taxonomic entities ofT. licus, and to infer the origin of a newly established population in the state of Sao Paulo. The molecular data indicated that specimens sampled at different regions in Brazil are morphologically cryptic but genetically isolated entities, and at least three subspecies were assigned to the sampled localities. These data also suggested that the population collected from the state of Sao Paulo must have a common origin with populations from northeast Brazil, which corroborate the hypothesis that ornamental plants infested with larvae ofT. licusmight have been transported from the northeast to the southeast regions.
