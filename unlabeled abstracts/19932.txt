Strophiole of seeds of the black locust acts as a water gap
In Japan the black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) is undergoing rapid habitat expansion, which has an adverse effect on native vegetation. It is therefore a priority to clarify the regeneration characteristics of the black locust and establish adequate management of this invasive species in Japan. To determine the germination characteristics of physically dormant black locust seeds, we observed anatomical features of the seed coat and identified the water gap that acts as a signal detector. Our microscopic observations showed that seed coats of this species had hilum, micropyle and strophiole. The anatomical features of these regions correspond to the general characteristics of papilionoid legume seeds. Based on our microscopic observations, water absorption blocking experiments and a dye tracking experiment, we identified the strophiole as a water gap in black locust seeds. Our results suggest that the opening of the strophiole is important for water uptake to the embryo and subsequent germination of black locust seeds under natural conditions.
