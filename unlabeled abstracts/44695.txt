Seed germination of invasive plant species of the genus Goldenrod (Solidago)
The germination of seeds of invasive compaction of plant species of the genus Solidago was studied in 38 samples selected within the Minsk (17 samples) and Novogrudok (21 samples) Upland in the autumn (14 samples), winter (11 samples) and spring (13 samples) periods 2017-2018 years. Germination of seeds varies in a wide range from 0 to 95%. Also, when registering the results, they revealed the presence of undeveloped seeds, the number of which in the samples ranges from 2 to 95 %. A pronounced feedback was established between the germination of seeds and the number of undeveloped seeds (correlation coefficient -0.97). Between autumn, winter and spring samples there were no statistically significant differences in seed germination and the number of undeveloped seeds. Between the samples selected within the Minsk and Novogrudok Upland, statistically significant differences were revealed both for seed germination (r = 0.00018) and for the number of undeveloped seeds (r = 0.00032). Thus, the dependence of germinating seed germination on seasonal climatic changes is not revealed. For seed germination, stratification is not required and they are resistant to frost. It is also necessary to conduct additional studies to identify the factors affecting the formation of seeds.
