Effect of Invasive Australian Acacias on the Regeneration, Growth and Nutrient Chemistry of South African Lowland Fynbos
Examined stands of the invasive Australian Acacia saligna and surrounding sand plain lowland fynbos vegetation after an autumn fire. Indigenous forms regenerated less successfully in acacia-infested than in natural habitats. Seedling:parent ratios of proteoids were 32%, restioids 42% and erocoids 65% of those in natural vegetation. Seedling mortalities of all plant forms were not different in the two habitats. The risk of local extinction after fire was three to four times greater for ericoids, five times greater for proteoids and seven times greater for restioids in acacia-infested than in natural habitats. Within a 10m2 acacia stand area, the probability of extinction of proteoids was high (99.7%) and moderate (56-57%) for ericoid and restioid forms. Soil N, Ca, Mg, K, Mn and B concentrations were higher and soil Fe concentrations lower in acacia-infested habitats, but the only significant concentration increases recorded for all plant forms were in the N and K of seedling leaves in acacia stands. Increased shoot:root ratios observed among indigenous forms in acacia-infested habitats reflected responses to shading by burnt acacia parental remnants rather than soil mineral enrichment. Acacia shoot:root ratios were unaffected by the different environmental conditions in acacia stands. The depletion of indigenous taxa, particularly obligate reseeding forms, beneath acacia stands results mainly from their poor seed regeneration success and associated increased risk of local extinction from stochastic causes after fire. -from Author
