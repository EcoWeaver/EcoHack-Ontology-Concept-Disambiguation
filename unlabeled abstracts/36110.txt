Invasion Potential, Impact and Population Structure of Non-native Fish Species, Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus, 1758) from the Tributary of the Ganga River, Central India
Fish population is a subject to natural control processes in respect of resource and a renewable resource if they are exploited in a systematic and planned manner. Random fish samples of Cyprinus carpio were collected. A total of 548 fish specimens in size ranges between 97 to 687 mm and age classes of 0+ to 9+ were used in present study. Invasion potential and population structure of C. carpio was studied during February 2019 to January 2020 from Sirsa fish landing centre at Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, Central India. C. carpio is of great socioeconomic importance for the region and keeps active a population of about 100 to 150 fishermen communities in Sirsa at Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh. The age classes (0+ to 9+) indicated that the C. carpio was powerfully invaded in the Tons river. In total stock, male population comprised 49.63% and female population 50.36% of the total catches. In the pooled samples, 1+ age group was most dominated with 24.09%. Stock of this age group was most abundant in the Tons river. The mesh size of the nets and length of net was also more harvested this age group compared to other age groups. The 7+, 8+ and 9+ age groups were shared minute proportion with 2.19%, 0.91% and 0.55%, respectively. These age groups considered as old age groups. In case of pooled samples, 0+, 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+ and 6+ age groups contributed as 6.35%, 21.35%, 18.61%, 13.87%, 7.85% and 3.83%, respectively.
