The non-native vascular flora of Belgium: new combinations and a new variety
The non-native vascular flora of Belgium: new combinations and a new variety. The application of a new classification, not only for families and genera but also for species and infraspecific taxa, based principally on molecular phylogenetic research (Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III 2009) for an online 'Manual of the Alien Plants of Belgium' (available since 2010) requires several name changes and new combinations. These taxonomic novelties are made and concisely commented in the present paper.
