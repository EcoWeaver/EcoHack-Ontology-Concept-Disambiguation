Susceptibility of Longleaf Pine Forest Associations in South Mississippi to Invasion by Cogongrass [Imperata cylindrica(L.) Beauv.]
If fire affects spread of cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), a non-native grass that displaces native plants, managers can determine best use of resources to restore and maintain the diverse herbaceous groundcovers of longleaf pine-bluestem (Pinus palustris - Andropogon spp. and Schizachyrium spp.) forests of the southeastern United States. In 2003 and 2004, we measured rates of vegetative encroachment of cogongrass into burned and unburned pine-bluestem and pine-shrub forests one and two years post-burning on Camp Shelby Training Site, Mississippi. Linear growth and tiller production were significantly greater in pine-bluestem forests compared to pine-shrub forests for both time periods. Cogongrass growth was not affected by burning in either forest type one-year post-burning, but was significantly greater in burned forests after two years of growth. Two-years post-burning, mean linear growth of cogongrass was 235 cm in burned pine-bluestem, 139 cm in unburned pine-bluestem, 177 cm in burned pine-shrub, and 92 cm in unburned pine- shrub. Tiller production/m2 for 2004 was greatest in pine-bluestem burned plots and least in pine-shrub unburned plots. Linear growth of cogongrass was significantly and positively correlated to percent cover of adjacent herbaceous vegetation but tiller numbers were significantly and negatively correlated to percent cover of adjacent shrubs. Efforts to restore pine-shrub forests to pine-bluestem forest conditions should implement control of cogongrass before and after use of Are. Vigilant control efforts are needed as restoration shifts conditions to those of pine-bluestem forests and increases susceptibility to cogongrass invasion.
