Feeding patterns and population structure of an invasive cyprinid, the rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus (Cypriniformes, Cyprinidae), in Buffalo Harbor (Lake Erie) and the upper Niagara River
Feeding patterns and population structure of the non-native rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus (Linnaeus) were examined to understand their ecology in Buffalo Harbor and the Niagara River. We hypothesized that (1) the diet of rudds would be omnivorous, but contain greater proportions of macrophytes in summer months, (2) feeding intensity would increase with water temperature, and (3) condition and growth would be similar to other populations. We collected rudds with a variety of gears in 2009 to test these hypotheses, and used data from 2007 to 2010 seining surveys to determine if the relative abundance of young-of-the-year rudd differed among sites with different flow conditions. Rudds were mostly herbivorous; they consumed aquatic macrophytes in summer and supplemented their diet with algae and fish in spring and fall. Feeding intensity was positively correlated with water temperature, but significantly reduced during spawning. Rudd condition and growth were greater than estimates from other populations, suggesting increases in abundance and range expansion are possible. Furthermore, reproduction was successful at lotic sites but very poor at sites without measureable flow, contrary to the paradigm of optimal rudd habitat. Research is needed to understand how herbivory by abundant rudd populations affects native aquatic communities.
