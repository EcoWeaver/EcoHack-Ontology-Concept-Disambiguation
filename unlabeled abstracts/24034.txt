Environmental and anthropogenic factors associated with coastal wetland differentiation in La Mancha, Veracruz, Mexico
At least 10% of the wetlands in Mexico are situated in the State of Veracruz on the central Gulf coast. The region has been intensively used for agriculture by humans for the last thousand years and today pastureland for cattle ranching is the dominant element of the landscape. We present a study of the wetland vegetation in a series of representative and internationally significant freshwater wetlands near the coastal lagoon La Mancha in Veracruz State. We obtained eleven wetland types formed by three wetland communities dominated by trees (mangrove or swamps), eight dominated by herbaceous species which we classified as marsh, five of which were native emergent marsh, one was a non-native emergent marsh and two were floating-leaved marsh. The highest diversity values were found in the Annona swamp, followed by the Sagittaria marsh and the Rhizophora-Laguncularia-Avicennia mangrove. CCA ordination showed that water level, disturbance and species number were the major factors explaining variation along axis 1, and on axis 2 conductivity, salinity, and bulk density. Wetland size was a major factor in both axes. We examined the interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that give rise to the nature and diversity of wetland types that characterize the important wetland landscapes in this part of Mexico, being disturbance by human activities an important factor that favors the appearance of diverse species combinations.
