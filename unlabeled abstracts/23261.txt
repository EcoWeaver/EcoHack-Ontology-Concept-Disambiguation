Artificial diets for the larval oak longicorn beetle, Moechotypa diphysis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)
The oak longicorn beetle, Moechotypa diphysis (Pascoe), is a pest of bed logs for shiitake mushroom and an invasive species on Japan's main islands. I attempted to rear larvae of M. diphysis on two artificial diets consisting of a commercially available diet for silkworm plus dried yeast and sawdust of the sawtooth oak, Quercus acutissima Carruthers, or of Japanese beech, Fagus crenata Blume. Newly hatched larvae were inoculated on these artificial diets and reared at 25degC in the dark. More than 60% of larvae emerged as adults when fed with these diets. The weights of emerged adults fed on the artificial diets were heavier than those emerging from logs of Q. acutissima, their natural diet, in a field cage. These results demonstrate that the two artificial diets are useful for rearing M. diphysis larvae and can assist further studies on the development of this invasive species.
