Habitat invasions by alien plants: a quantitative comparison among Mediterranean, subcontinental and oceanic regions of Europe
An important part of the current study was the development of a common platform of habitat classification for the three regions. Although the systems of vegetation classification in most European countries are based on the Braun-Blanquet approach (Westhoff & van der Maarel 1973), compatibility of standard vegetation classifications used in different countries is limited. In the current study, this problem was amplified further by a large geographical distance between the studied regions (implying large habitat differences) and different traditions of vegetation classification in the United Kingdom and continental Europe. Therefore, we used broadly delimited habitat types (hereafter called habitats) which reflected environmental features common to the three regions. We adopted the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) Habitats Classification, a standard classification of European habitats developed by the European Environment Agency (http://eunis.eea.europa.eu/habitats.jsp). From the version of this classification, available online from October 2005, we used habitats on hierarchical Level 2, but where these habitats were too heterogeneous with respect to the level of invasion we also used habitats on Level 3. In some cases we merged two or three habitats, because we were not able to assign many plots unequivocally to one of them. In total, we used 33 habitat classes, of which 14 were recorded in all the three regions (Appendix S1 in Supplementary material).
