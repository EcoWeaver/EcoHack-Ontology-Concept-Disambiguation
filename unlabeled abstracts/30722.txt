Invasions and Declines of Submersed Macrophytes in the Tidal Potomac River and Estuary, the Currituck Sound-Back Bay System, and the Pamlico River Estuary
Long-term changes in biomass, species composition, and distribution of submersed aquatic macrophytes have been documented and studied at two sites in the mid-Atlantic region: the tidal Potomac River and Estuary in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, and the Currituck Sound-Back Bay system in Virginia and North Carolina. Additional information based on a shorter time period is available for the Pamlico River Estuary in North Carolina. This paper briefly describes the study areas and summaries the history of declines and increases in each area and factors implicated in these changes. The remainder of the paper is devoted to a discussion of factors influencing invasion/establishment success and the current status of submersed macrophytes in the three areas.
