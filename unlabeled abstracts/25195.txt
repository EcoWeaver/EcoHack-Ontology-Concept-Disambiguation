Genetic variation in Malaysian oysters: taxonomic ambiguities and evidence of biological invasion
Genetic diversities in two cultured oyster species, Crassostrea iredalei (Faustino 1932) and Crassostrea belcheri (Sowerby 1871) were assessed using a 581-nucleotide fragment of the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene. A total of 103 C. iredalei individuals and 120 C. belcheri from 12 populations were sampled along the coast of Malaysia. Trees of unique haplotype samples generated based on Neighbor-Joining (NJ) algorithm revealed that many individuals had been misidentified and did not cluster with their presumed species based on morphological identification. BLAST results of DNA sequences showed presence of previously unreported C. madrasensis in Peninsular Malaysian waters (98% maximum identity). The true identity of the Muar (Crassostrea sp.) and Semporna (Saccostrea sp.) populations were unresolved by two BLAST search and showed less than 88% identity with other species in GenBank. Repeated analysis of these two populations using 487bp of the mitochondrial 16S gene data showed only a maximum identity less than 97%. Hence, the identity of these specimens remains unclear. Evolutionary divergences within presumed species were 0.001-0.011 and 0.034-0.313 between species. Findings from this study have important implications for aquaculture, management and monitoring of cultured populations as well as conservation of wild oyster species in Malaysia.
