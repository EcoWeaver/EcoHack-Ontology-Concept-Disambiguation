Effect of temperature on the life history of Dysmicoccus neobrevipes (Hemiptera: Pseudoccocidae): An invasive species of gray pineapple mealybug in South China
The gray pineapple mealybug, Dysmicoccus neobrevipes Beardsley, is an invasive pest that during recent years has caused serious damage on Sisal (Agave sisalana Perrine) crops in South China. The biology of D. neobrevipes including its development, survivorship, longevity and reproduction was investigated at six constant temperatures (17, 20, 23, 26, 29 and 32 degC) under laboratory conditions. Results indicated that the developmental periods of D. neobrevipes females (from the first instar nymph to adult) shortened from 55.4 days at 17 degC to 16.9 days at 29 degC, while the males' decreased from 54.0 days at 17 degC to 15.8 days at 32 degC. The highest survivorship of D. neobrevipes from the first instar nymph to adult was recorded at 29 degC; 88.8% for females and 89.2% for males. The average longevity of females was 95.0 days at 17 degC, but decreased to 30.0 days at 26 degC. This was still significantly longer than those of males; 5.6 days at 17 degC and 2.3 days at 32 degC. The average number of nymphs laid per female increased with increasing temperature and reached a maximum of 409.4 nymphs at 23 degC. The intrinsic rates of increase (rm) of D. neobrevipes at the range of temperatures between 17 and 32 degC were 0.0287, 0.0613, 0.0941, 0.1131, 0.1202 and 0.0485, respectively. The lower temperature thresholds for females and males of D. neobrevipes from the 1st instar nymph to adult estimated using the linear model were 8.7 and 10.3 degC, respectively. The thermal constants for females and males were 370.4 and 312.5DD, respectively. The results indicate that temperature has significant effects on the biology of D. neobrevipes and that the optimum temperature range for its population growth is 23-29 degC.
