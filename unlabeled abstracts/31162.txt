Review of the genus Strumigenys (Hymenoptera, Formicidae, Myrmicinae) in Hong Kong with the description of three new species and the addition of five native and four introduced species records
The species of the ant genusStrumigenysSmith, 1860 found in Hong Kong are reviewed based on new sampling efforts performed over the past five years (2014-2018). Prior to this, 12Strumigenysspecies had been recorded from Hong Kong, all confirmed here. Moreover, we add to this list three newly described species:S.hirsutasp. n.,S.lantauisp. n., andS.nathistorisocsp. n., and describe for the first time the worker caste ofS.formosaTerayama, Lin &amp; Wu, 1995. We report new records for nine additional species, bringing the total number of species to 24, including four newly recorded species (S.hexameraBrown, 1958,S.membraniferaEmery, 1869,S.nepalensisBaroni Urbani and De Andrade, 1994, andS.rogeriEmery, 1890) which are considered to be introduced to Hong Kong. A global review of the introducedStrumigenysspecies is presented. The taxonomic validity ofS.feaeandS.formosensisis discussed in light of new specimen measurements. New ecological information on the swarming periods of 11 species is presented on the basis of year-long sampling of aerial insects. Finally, the importance of our results within Southeast Asia and the need for future sampling efforts in the region is discussed.
