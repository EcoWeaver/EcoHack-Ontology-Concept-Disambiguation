Introduction, distribution, spread, and impacts of exotic freshwater gastropods in Texas
We examined the patterns of distribution, vectors of introduction, and potential ecological impacts of freshwater exotic species in Texas over the last 45years. Currently, five species of exotic gastropods are established: channeled-type applesnail (Pomacea insularum), red-rim melania (Melanoides tuberculatus), quilted melania (Tarebia granifera), giant rams-horn snail (Marisa cornuarietis), and Chinese mysterysnail (Cipangopaludina chinensis). In contrast to the northern part of the US, where shipping appears to be the most important vector for the introduction of aquatic invasive species, aquarium and ornamental trade dominated among unintentional vectors of introduction of all freshwater exotics in Texas, resulting in different patterns of distribution, spread, and ecological impacts. The rate of spread of exotic gastropods in Texas varied from 39 waterbodies colonized over 18years for P. insularum to only three waterbodies during last 45years for C. chinensis. Four of five exotic gastropods were found in highly vulnerable aquifer-fed springs and rivers, which contain numerous endemic and endangered species. The fifth species, Pomacea insularum, is an agricultural pest. Potential negative ecological effects of exotic gastropods include impacts on wetlands and wetland restoration, competitive exclusion of native snails, and the introduction of exotic parasites, trematodes, which could infect fish and waterfowl, including federally protected species. Aquifer springs with stable temperature regimes are refuges for both cold and warm intolerant species.
