Scavenging in Mediterranean ecosystems: effect of the invasive Argentine ant
Above-ground invertebrates may represent a high proportion of animal biomass, but few data are available on their fate after death. In Mediterranean ant communities, they are frequently scavenged by ants. Here, we assessed the consequences of Argentine ant invasion on the removal of arthropod corpses in Donana National Park (SW Spain). In three natural habitats that differed in their degree of vegetation cover (i.e. protection for ants against high temperatures), we experimentally provided dead Drosophila, and observed their disappearance over a 60-min period at different times of day and year. The habitats used were isolated cork oak trees, pine tree forest and dry scrubland; we compared invaded with uninvaded plots in each. Oak trees were the most invaded habitat, while scrubland was the least and the only one where the Argentine ant coexisted with native ant species. In accordance with this degree of invasion, the Argentine ant removed the highest percentage of dead flies in oak trees and the lowest in scrubland. Its performance as scavenger was higher than uninvaded ant communities, but it was reduced at high temperatures, when native species were highly efficient. The saturated distribution of the Argentine ant colony seems to be the key to its efficiency. We discuss how the occurrence and scavenger efficiency of the Argentine ant could affect the nutrient cycling and the progression of its invasion.
