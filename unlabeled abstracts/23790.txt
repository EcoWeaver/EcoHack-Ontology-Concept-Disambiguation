Nitrogen Mineralization and Leaching in the Early Stages of a Subtropical Reforestation in Southern China
Nitrogen cycling is a critical component in plantations, yet the spatial and temporal variations of N transforma-tions in different stages of reforestation are often poorly known. Here we report the seasonal variation of soil in situ net N mineralization, net nitrification and N leach-ing in five young plantations (two monocultures of exotic species: Eucalyptus urophylla and Acacia crassicarpa; a native species monoculture; a 10-species mixture and a 30-species mixture) and a shrubland (without experimen-tal planting) in subtropical southern China. Our results show that net N mineralization and nitrification rates in the E. urophylla monoculture (13.5 and 9.98 kg N ha -1 yr -1 , respectively) were the lowest among six planting treatments, less than 1/3 of those in the 10-species and 30-species mixtures. Two exotic fast-growing monocultures had 10-60% lower soil extractable nitrate concentrations than the native plantations and shrubland and had the lowest nitrogen leaching losses. The leguminous A. crassi-carpa monoculture did not have higher soil N availability in comparison with non-leguminous species. Both N miner-alization and nitrification varied seasonally; soil moisture seemed to be important in controlling these temporal vari-ations. This study highlights that in the early stages of reforestaion, a better understanding of plant species effects on soil N cycling would be beneficial to forest manage-ment decisions and could provide a critical foundation for advancing restoration practices.
