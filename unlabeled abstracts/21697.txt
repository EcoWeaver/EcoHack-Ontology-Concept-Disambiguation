Presence of Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone, 1931) in the Southern Gulf of Mexico
This is the first report of the presence of Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei in the Southern Gulf of Mexico coast. Seven specimens were collected in the Carmen-Pajonal-Machona lagoons near La Azucena and Sanchez Magallanes in Tabasco, Mexico, during a shrimp monitoring program survey conducted in this area. Further sampling and monitoring are required to find evidence that confirms the establishment of a population of Pacific white shrimp L. vannamei in Southern Gulf of Mexico.
