Increased Topsoil Mineral Nutrient Concentrations Under exotic invasive plants in Belgium
Exotic invasive plants can alter ecosystem processes. For the first time in Europe, we have analysed the impacts of exotic invasive plants on topsoil chemical properties. At eight sites invaded by five exotic invasive species (Fallopia japonica, Heracleum mantegazzianum, Solidago gigantea, Prunus serotina and Rosa rugosa), soil mineral element composition was compared between invaded patches and adjacent, uninvaded vegetation. We found increased concentrations of exchangeable essential nutrients under the canopy of exotic invasive plants, most strikingly so for K and Mn (32% and 34% increase, respectively). This result fits in well with previous reports of enhanced N dynamics in invaded sites, partly due to higher net primary productivity in exotic invasive plants compared to native vegetation.
