What does the germination ecophysiology of the invasiveAcacia saligna(Labill.) Wendl. (Fabaceae) teach us for its management?
Acacia saligna is a phanerophyte native to Australia; it was introduced in the 1950s in Sardinia (Italy) for afforestation mainly in coastal areas and at present it is considered naturalized, becoming invasive in sand dune habitats. Seed biology is one of the most important factors contributing to the invasion success of Australian acacias, for this reason the germination ability is an important issue when trying to clarify the invasion dynamics of A. saligna. Germination tests were conducted at the BG-SAR, testing the effect of different temperatures and percentages of NaCl, on seeds belonging to five accessions from four populations of two coastal habitat types. The optimal temperature range for seed germination was 15-208C; the increase of salt caused a decrease in the final germination percentages. At 1% of NaCl concentration, germination fell at 25-308C and at 2% it was relatively low (below 40%) and occurred almost only at 158C. This work represents a contribution to the knowledge of the seed ecology and germination behaviour of the species, providing new data on the interpopulation and interannual variability, and relating them to the invasion dynamics of A. saligna in the coastal Mediterranean habitats.
