Habitat and Season Dependent the Invasion of Micro-fungi in Decaying Wooden Flinders: a Case Study of the Dandak Cave of Chhattisgarh, India
Subterranean caves represent itself always a sterile ecosystem as it usually has very bleak connections with the external world. Due to complete lack of light, the existence of autotrophs become out of question inside the cave and whatever the organic energy sources get available inside the cave are mostly transported from the external world. Thus, most of the micro-fungi found inside the caves are also generally transported inside from some external agencies. Further, the available habitats inside the cave either abolish them completely or accelerate them to flourish. In the present study, we have tried to isolate the micro-fungi responsible fordecaying the wood log inside a cave, Dandak of Chhattisgarh, India. Samples were collected from two different habitats of the cave, one which remains under the influence of external world (outer chamber) the other which is almost isolated from it (inner chamber).We found that besides some other genera of micro-fungi, the genus Aspergillus is dominating the decaying process of wood in the outer chamber whereas the genus Penicillium is dominating the same for the inner chamber.
