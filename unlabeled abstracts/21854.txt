Daphnia lumholtzi Sars a new alien species in Lake St. Clair
Daphnia lumholtzi Sars, an exotic tropical/subtropical cladoceran from Australia, southeast Asia, and Africa, was newly found in Lake St. Clair in a vertical tow sample taken at 3 m depth on 25 July 2007. The species was previously found in 1990/1991 in some reservoirs in the southern United States from where it colonized many waters north to the Great Lakes. In 1999, it was found in Lake Erie. This cladoceran had a density of 117 individuals/m3 when we collected it from Lake St. Clair and it was represented by both females (95.12%) and males (4.88 %). It seems that D. lumholtzi will continue to expand its distribution area in the Great Lakes.
