First report of Northern brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus Ives, 1891 in Strait of Sicily
Four specimens of the northern brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus Ives, 1891, a West Atlantic species, were unexpectedly caught by bottom trawlers along the South coast of Sicily between Porto Empedocle and Mazara del Vallo (Central Mediterranean). The dispersal and transport of shrimp eggs and larvae via surface water circulation is suggested as the likely cause of its rapid westward spread since its first appearance in the Gulf of Antalya (Turkey) in 2009. The settlement of P. aztecus in Mediterranean coastal habitats may result in competition with the native caramote prawn Penaeus kerathurus (Forskal, 1775). Some aspects of the species geographical distribution in Mediterranean are briefly discussed in relation to the circulation pattern of surface waters.
