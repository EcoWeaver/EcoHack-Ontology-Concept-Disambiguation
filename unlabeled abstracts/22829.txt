An evaluation of the impact of Melaleuca quinquenervia invasion and management on plant community structure after fire
Two questions were asked in this study: after a fire, does the choice of invasive plant management strategy, namely herbicidal or biological, alter (1) plant community assemblages and (2) the re-invasion potential of the Australian tree Melaleuca quinquenervia? Plant species richness was highest in the non-invaded and herbicide sites compared to the biological site with 10.5, 10.8, and 8.25speciesm-2 found in each site, respectively. Although the total count of live and dead seedlings was highest in the biologically controlled site at 22.8 and 13.6plantsm-2, respectively, M. quinquenervia seedlings were recruited in all sites. While the ultimate goal of management programs is to restore ecosystem integrity, this work provides evidence that passive restoration may not be enough to restore plant community structure in this system.
