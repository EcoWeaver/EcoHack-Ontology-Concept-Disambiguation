The role of behavior in the success of invasive crustaceans
Many crustaceans have been moved to new locations where they have caused ecological or economic problems, that is, have become invasive. This article focuses on the role of animal behavior in contributing to their success. Certain behaviors are particularly relevant, including (1) feeding: outcompeting native species for food or eating native species of concern; (2) predator avoidance: the invader may be more successful at avoiding predators than native species; (3) habitat: invasive species may displace natives from their habitat or may alter the environment; (4) aggressive behavior: may contribute to (1) or (3) above; (5) movements: if the invader undergoes extensive migrations, it can spread more rapidly; (6) plasticity: (learning) if the invader is "smarter" than native species, it may be more likely to outcompete them for habitat and/or food; and (7) reproduction (though not strictly reproductive behavior per se). These behaviors are discussed with respect to invasive crustaceans, including freshwater and marine examples.
