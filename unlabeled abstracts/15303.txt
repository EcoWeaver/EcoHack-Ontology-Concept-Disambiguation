Arundo micrantha, a new reed species for Italy, threatened in the freshwater habitat by the congeneric invasiveA. donax
Arundo micrantha Lam., a reed species from southern Mediterranean area, has found in Sardinia. Its presence represents the first record for Italy and the third one for western Europe. Investigations on distribution and ecology of the Sardinian population have been carried out, with special focusing on synecology of the species. A. micrantha has found in 40 localities mainly distributed along temporary streams and permanent rivers in the central and southern part of the island. Most of Sardinian populations occurs on alluvial soils in Thermomediterranean bioclimatic context. The autonomy of Sardinian phytocoenoses was characterized with the definition of exclusive floristic taxa, biological and chorological elements, and syndinamic relationships with other assemblages. Comparing the community with other reed beds from the Mediterranean basin, a marked floristic differentiation arose between the phytocoenoses characterized by autochthonous Arundo species and those dominated by the invasive Arundo donax. Finally, management activities are proposed to ensure the conservation of this threatened autochthonous plant community in freshwater habitat.
