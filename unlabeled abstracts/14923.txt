Fine scale spatio-temporal life history shifts in an invasive species at its expansion front
The dynamic shifts in life history traits by non-native populations at an invasion front may be driven by a combination of phenotypic plasticity and micro-evolutionary processes, allowing for appropriate responses to changes in biotic and abiotic factors associated with range expansion. The temporal and spatial scale at which these shifts occur, however, is largely unexplored. We examined the age-specific life-history responses of female round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) across a fine spatial scale by comparing traits of individuals at the expanding front of an invasive pathway with those of individuals living at the previous year's front. Females in the new front were younger, exhibited higher body condition index and fecundity, and greater reproductive allocation than those living at the previous year's front. No difference in back-calculated length at age or in seasonal growth increment was found between occupants of the old and new fronts. Age-specific differences in reproductive investment were observed; age-1 females from the new front exhibited greater reproductive effort but similar reproductive allocation, whereas age-2 females showed greater reproductive allocation in the new front, but similar reproductive effort. These age-specific differences may be related to differences in population density and other biotic factors encountered during ontogeny, or to micro-evolutionary processes. Our results demonstrate that fine scale changes in energy allocation towards reproduction through increases in reproductive allocation and fecundity occur at the invasion front, highlight how quickly those shifts can occur at the expansion front, and suggest that such changes in newly colonised areas facilitate range expansion.
