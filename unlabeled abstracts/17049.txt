Assessing the conservation status of the strict endemic Desertas wolf spider, Hogna ingens (Araneae, Lycosidae)
The Desertas Islands (Madeira, Portugal) are the sole home of one of the largest and rarest wolf spider species, Hogna ingens (Blackwall, 1857) (Araneae, Lycosidae). Despite its size, it inhabits a single valley in the North of the Deserta Grande Island, Vale da Castanheira, currently invaded by the herb Phalaris aquatica. This invasive species competes with the native flora and was subject to several eradication experiments, namely through fire and chemicals. The objectives of this work were to: (1) estimate the current distribution and abundance of H. ingens and respective trends; (2) evaluate the impact of the invasive plant and eradication methods on the spider population; (3) suggest future measures for the recovery of the species; and (4) evaluate its conservation status according to the IUCN criteria. The current distribution of H. ingens covers 23 ha, a recent reduction from its original 83 ha, corresponding to the entire Vale da Castanheira. A total of 4447 and 4086 adults and 71,832 and 24,635 juveniles were estimated to live in the valley during 2011 and 2012, respectively. We found a significant negative impact of P. aquatica cover on the presence and abundance of H. ingens and that chemical treatment specifically directed towards the invasive plant species may be the only way to effectively recover the spider's habitat. We suggest (1) regular monitoring; (2) extend chemical treatments; (3) ex-situ conservation with future reintroduction of adults. Based on the current area of occupancy (AOO) of H. ingens and its recent decline in both AOO and number of individuals, it was recently classified as Critically Endangered by IUCN and we suggest its urgent inclusion in the Habitats Directive species lists.
