The occurrence of Ambrosia pollen in Rzeszow, Krakow and Poznan, Poland: investigation of trends and possible transport of Ambrosia pollen from Ukraine
Previous studies have shown that ragweed pollen arrives in Poland from sources in the south, in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Austria. It is likely that ragweed pollen also arrives from sources in the southeast (e.g. Ukraine). This hypothesis was investigated using 13 years of pollen data and back-trajectory analysis. Ambrosia pollen data were collected at three sites in Poland, Rzeszow, Krakow and Poznan. The amount of ragweed pollen recorded at Rzeszow was significantly higher than in Poznan and Krakow. This can be related to either a higher abundance of local populations of Ambrosia in south-east Poland or the proximity of Rzeszow to foreign sources of ragweed pollen. The combined results of pollen measurements and air mass trajectory calculations identified plumes of Ambrosia pollen that were recorded at Rzeszow, Krakow and Poznan on 4 and 5 September 1999 and 3 September 2002. These plumes arrived at the pollen-monitoring sites from an easterly direction, indicating sources of Ambrosia pollen in eastern Poland or Ukraine. This identifies Ukraine as a possible new source of ragweed pollen for Poland and therefore an important source area of Ambrosia pollen on the European Continent.
