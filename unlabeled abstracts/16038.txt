Long term changes in the fish fauna of Lago de Patzcuaro in Central Mexico
Fish assemblages of lakes from central Mexico have been altered as a result of water over-exploitation, pollution, habitat fragmentation, and introduction of exotic species. Patterns and the extent of change in most of these systems are poorly documented. This paper presents a long-term study of changes in the fish fauna of Lago de Patzcuaro (State of Michoacan, Mexico). Long-term information (years 1900-2010) of fish communities was used to explore trends in the composition of the fish community and their ecological attributes. Trends across time for each fish guild were evaluated through a multivariate analysis of variance. Native species dominated total species richness over the entire study period, but exotic fish comprised 46% of the community in the 2010s. During the last 110 years, there has been a decline in the number of carnivore species and an increase of omnivore species in the Lago de Patzcuaro fish community. Sensitive species have disappeared from the lake and species tolerant to environmental degradation have increased from 13% to 61%. The data suggest that anthropic effects on the environmental condition of Lago de Patzcuaro are associated with the loss of ecosystem elements (fish species) and ecosystem processes (species interactions). Ecological restoration and conservation programs must include information of these long term studies to be more effective in their efforts
