Effects of leaf litter and its fungal colonization on the diet of Limnomysis benedeni (Crustacea: Mysida)
The strong invasive freshwater mysid Limnomysis benedeni, a detritivorousherbivorous feeder, has a preference for small food particles, but also feeds on leaf litter. Here, we tested whether leaf litter consumption by L. benedeni depends on the tree species and leaf conditioning (two types of physical and biological leaf conditioning). At the physical leaf conditioning, L. benedeni was fed with shortly leached or extensively leached leaves of five tree species in laboratory food assays. The mysid consumed shortly leached leaves of Copper Beech, Lombardy Poplar, Common Oak, and especially White Willow, and did not feed on shortly leached Black Alder leaves. The consumption of extensively leached leaves by L. benedeni did not depend on the tree species. Overall, 74% of the variation of the leaf consumption by L. benedeni was explained by the significant interaction of the factors carbon content and polyphenol content of the leaves, caused the feeding strategy of L. benedeni. For the biological leaf conditioning, the mysids consumed to a high degree naturally conditioned leaves, followed by leaves colonized by one of three fungi, but oomycete-colonized leaf litter and autoclaved leaves were consumed at similar low levels. Our results indicate that L. benedeni feeds on different types of conditioned leaves to different extents, and therefore may affect leaf litter degradation in many invaded freshwaters.
