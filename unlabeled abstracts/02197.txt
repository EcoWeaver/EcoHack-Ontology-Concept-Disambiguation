A scenario for invasion and dispersal of Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) in New Zealand
To date, there has been no confirmed, indigenously acquired case of arthropod-borne viral disease in New Zealand, but this may change in the near future due to the presence of exotic vectors and regular influx of infected humans. The risk of a disease outbreak may be aggravated if other exotic mosquito vectors become established, in particular Aedes albopictus (Skuse), a species that has already been intercepted several times in New Zealand. In this study, the possible means of invasion and dispersal of Ae. albopictus in northern New Zealand are discussed, along with the factors that should facilitate its establishment in the event it evades border controls.
