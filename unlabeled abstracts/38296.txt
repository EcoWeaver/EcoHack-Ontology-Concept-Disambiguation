Brugmansia suaveolens (Humb. & Bonpl. ex Willd.) Sweet (Solanaceae): an alien species new to continental Europe
The occurrence of Brugmansia suaveolens (Solanaceae), a neophyte native to South America but cultivated for traditional medicine and ornament in many tropical and temperate areas of the world, is reported for the first time as casual for continental Europe. The species was discovered in two small populations in southern Italy, along the Tyrrhenian coast of the Campania region. Notes of the environments in which the species was found and its naturalization status are also presented. This new finding confirms the role of anthropic areas as starting points for the invasion processes in Italy.
