No evidence for intraguild predation of Dikerogammarus villosus (Sowinsky, 1894) at an invasion front in the Untere Lorze, Switzerland
The establishment of non-indigenous aquatic invertebrates may strongly affect community and food web structures in invaded systems. The invasion of the Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus in European waterways, has led to the displacement of other macroinvertebrates, especially other amphipod species. The key factor for the decline of both native and invasive amphipods is assumed to be strong intraguild predation (IGP) by D. villosus, as observed in laboratory studies. However, the importance of IGP under field conditions is nearly unknown. Here, we investigated the trophic annidation of the invasive D. villosus in a benthic food web in one season in 2011, focusing especially on the relevance of IGP at an invasion front in Switzerland. We combined stable isotope analyses with molecular analyses of D. villosus' gut content using a group-specific primer for gammarid amphipods. Analyses of the standard ellipse area showed a strong overlap of the isotopic niches of the amphipod taxa. Niche width analysed by Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R (SIBER) revealed no significant differences between D. villosus and the native gammarid species. Furthermore, we did not detect DNA of native gammarid species in any of the 62 analysed gut contents of D. villosus as direct evidence for predation. However, diet of amphipods may vary over the year and we cannot exclude completely the hypothesis that D. villosus does predate upon native gammarids. Nevertheless our results indicated that IGP is not the key factor in the displacement of native amphipods and does not seem to play an important role in invasion of the investigated Swiss water body. Hence, factors other than IGP seem to be the driving forces for the observed displacement of native amphipods.
