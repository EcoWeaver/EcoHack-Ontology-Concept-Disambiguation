Rapid evolution of a native species following invasion by a congener
Making adjustments for a new neighborhood Competition between species drives the acquisition of diversity. Stuart et al. introduced a non-native anole lizard to natural experimental islands. In response, the original inhabitants adopted higher perches in the trees, where the larger invader was at a disadvantage. Within about 3 years--or 20 generations--the shift led to inherited morphological changes in the native lizards, including their growing larger toepads. Science , this issue p. 463
