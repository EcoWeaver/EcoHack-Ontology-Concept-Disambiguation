Using multi-remote sensing data to assess Phragmites invasion of the Detroit river international wildlife refuge
Purpose - This paper aims to develope an integrated image processing method to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of Phragmites invasion in the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge on the basis of publically available sources. Design/methodology/approach - This new approach integrates the standard time-series analysis of Landsat images with USDA National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery and USGS Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads (DOQQ) datasets, which are either classified or manually interpreted with the aid of ground control points. Three different types of spatiotemporal dimensions are designed to test this integrated time-series image analysis method: The selected sites and selected time-points with high spatial resolution and sufficient validation data points, the intermediate time-series with continued yearly images and periodical validation data, and the long time-series with periodical images without enough validation data. The support vector machine (SVM) method was used to classify the Landast TM sequence images to detect the Phragmites invasion. Findings - The habitat map produced by NAIP images and field collection data shows that the total Phragmites area of DRIWR in 2010 is 4221.87 acres without treatment areas and similar with the removed non-vegetation method. It is confirmed that the pre-classification method can obtain more accurate results. Originality value - The test results show that the Landsat-5 data can be used for long-term environmental management and monitoring of Phragmites invasion and can achieve rehabilitation of invasion areas.
