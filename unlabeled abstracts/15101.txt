Rapid kudzu eradication and switchgrass establishment through herbicide, bioherbicide and integrated programmes
Among the most important and visible weeds in the Southeastern U.S. is the exotic invasive vine, kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata). Efforts to eradicate it typically involve many years of application of restricted-use pesticides. Recent availability of effective, non-restricted use pesticides and developments with the application of the bioherbicide Myrothecium verrucaria has made possible new control programs for kudzu management. Field trials at three sites over two years with aminocyclopyrachlor, aminopyralid, fluroxypyr, metsulfuron methyl and combinations of these herbicides achieved 99 to 100% reduction in aboveground kudzu biomass. Additionally, programs were developed that eradicated kudzu while simultaneously establishing native vegetation. One of these successful programs integrated bioherbicide application, mechanical removal of kudzu biomass and planting switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) in an entirely chemical herbicide-free system. These field tests demonstrate a variety of methods that can be used independently or in an integrated approach for rapid kudzu eradication.
