Detection of the Invasive Mosquito Species Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti and Aedes (Hulecoeteomyia) koreicus on the Southern Coast of the Crimean Peninsula
Background: The incidence and area of arbovirus infections is increasing around the world. It is largely linked to the spread of the main arbovirus vectors, invasive mosquito of the genus Aedes. Previously, it has been reported that Aedes aegypti reemerged in Russia after a 50-year absence. Moreover, in 2011, Ae. albopictus was registered in the city of Sochi (South Russia, Black Sea coast) for the first time. In 2013, Asian Ae. koreicus was found in Sochi for the first time. Methods: Mosquitoes were collected using the following methods: larvae with a dip net, imago on volunteers and using bait traps. The mosquitoes were identified using both morphology and sequencing of the second internal transcribed spacer of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene cluster. Results: In August 2016, Ae. koreicus larvae and imago and a single male of Ae. aegypti were found on the southern coast of the Crimean Peninsula, where they were not registered before. Newly obtained DNA sequences were registered in GenBank with the accession numbers MF072936 and MF072937. Conclusion: Detection of invasive mosquito species (Ae. aegypti and Ae. koreicus) implies the possibility of their area expansion. Intensive surveillance is required at the Crimean Peninsula to evaluate the potential for the introduction of vector-borne diseases.
