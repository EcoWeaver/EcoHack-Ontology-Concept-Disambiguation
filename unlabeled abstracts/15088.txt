Genetic structure of native and invasive populations of Harmonia axyridis Pall. in the light of global invasion
The population genetic structure, possible causes, sources, and routes of global invasion of the ladybird Harmonia axyridis are discussed. Infection with the reproductive endosymbionts is considered in the light of possible influence on the formation of evolutionary preadaptations that contributed to the invasion.
