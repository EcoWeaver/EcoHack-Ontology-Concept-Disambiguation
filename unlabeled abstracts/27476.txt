The Enlargement of the Suez Canal and Introduction of Non-Indigenous Species to the Mediterranean Sea
The Suez Canal is one of the most important waterways in the world - during the last year 17,148 ships passed through the Canal - reducing emissions, saving time, and operating costs to shippers. The rapid increase in ship size from the " Post-Suezmax " (> 12,000 TEU) to the latest container vessels (> 19,000 TEU) now requires enlargements of port facilities and canals. A project of this magnitude, and with potentially negative environmental outcomes , requires a transparent and scientifically sound " Environmental Impact Assessment " (EIA). An explicit obligation on Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (https://www.cbd.int/doc/ legal/cbd-en.pdf) was made to consider transboundary impacts on biodiversity, particularly those associated with invasive non-indigenous species. Although a non-binding instrument, the " Rio Declaration on Environment and Development " sets forth important principles of international environmental law (UN 1992): States are responsible for ensuring that activities within their jurisdiction do not damage the environment of other States, and EIA, as a national instrument, shall be undertaken for proposed activities that are likely to have a significant adverse impact on the environment. To our knowledge, no Environmental Impact Assessment has been fig. 1. The number of nonindigenous species in some Mediterranean countries.
