Population dynamics of alien gammarid species in the River Odra estuary
During the period of 1988-2000, three alien gammarid species, i.e. Gammarus tigrinus Sexton, 1939, Pontogammarus robustoides G. O. Sars, 1894, and Dikerogammarus haemobaphes (Eichwald, 1841) were recorded in the Odra estuary. This study, the first record of G. tigrinus and P. robustoides in Poland, focuses on the distribution, abundance, and biomass as well as on population structure of the three new species found in the coastal zone of the estuary. G. tigrinus and P. robustoides were first sampled in the Szczecin Lagoon (mid-part of the estuary) in 1988. The densities of both species were high from the time they were first recorded and exceeded 10 000 ind. m-2, while the biomass was 25 and 140 g m-2, respectively. G.tigrinus occurred at higher densities in northern and eastern parts of the Lagoon, while P. robustoides was particularly abundant in the south-eastern part, most heavily affected by River Odra discharge. In 1999, the third gammarid, D. haemobaphes, was recorded in the southern part of the estuary. Both in 1999 and 2000, the species was found in qualitative samples (dredge collections of Dreissena polymorpha) taken from the western branch of the river. As estimated from quantitative samples, densities and biomass in the eastern branch were rather low and did not exceed 150 ind. m-2 and 2.7 g m-2, respectively. The Szczecin Lagoon population of G. tigrinus produces at least two generations within a year: a summer one and an overwintering one. The latter is dominated by older and larger specimens. The species may reproduce in the Lagoon from April until November.
