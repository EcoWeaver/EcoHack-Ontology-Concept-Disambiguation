Spread of the non-indigenous serpulid Hydroides sanctaecrucis Kroyer in Morch, 1863 in the Pacific Ocean: a new record from Taiwan
The serpulid polychaete Hydroides sanctaecrucis Kroyer in Morch, 1863, native to the Caribbean, was found in the Port of Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and this currently represents the most northern record within the western Pacific Ocean. It was found associated with the invasive dreissenid bivalve Mytilopsis sallei (Recluz, 1849), also native to the Caribbean. It is likely that the spread of this serpulid within the Pacific Ocean has been due to vessel hull fouling, and the extensive shell surfaces of M. sallei in the estuarine regions of the port have provided suitable surfaces for its settlement. Here we review the occurrence of H. sanctaecrucis within the Pacific Ocean. It is expected to spread to other ports in the western Pacific Ocean.
