Preference for Heated Substrate in Captive River Cooters (Pseudemys concinna): A Potential Use for the Control of Invasive Populations
Invasive species threaten global biodiversity as well as human livelihood and much of the global lands are vulnerable to these threats. Numerous fresh water turtles from the northern hemisphere have been introduced in East Asian countries, including the Republic of Korea. Knowing turtle's behavioral ecology is valuable to manage introduced populations and a distinctive behavior is basking for behavioral thermoregulation. To understand the possibility of using basking to enhance trapping, we tested thermotaxis in the river cooter (Pseudemys concinna). Turtles were placed in an aquarium containing heated and non-heated mats under controlled water and air temperature, air humidity and light. We found that P. concinna stayed significantly longer on heated mats than on unheated control mats in 11 out of 18 trials, demonstrating that heat source is a potential attractant for P. concinna. We recommend the use of heat source to bait traps used for population control of invasive fresh water turtles.
