Prunus serotina in Italy: a challenging candidate for the national list of priority invasive alien species
In accordance with the European regulation on Invasive Alien Species (IAS), the black cherry tree (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) has recently been indicated as one of the 96 species proposed for the development of the national list of priority alien species in Italy. The species, native to North America, is recognised as one of the most harmful IAS in Europe, given its high spread potential and the associated ecological and economic impacts reported in its alien range. Although P. serotina is recognised as a pest within the EU, plants are still available on the market, confirming intentional introduction as a current potential pathway for this species arrival into new areas. Since a comprehensive overview of the main features characterizing the invasive potential of this species is still lacking, we aim to underpin the high priority status of P. serotina as a IAS of main concern in Italy by outlining the main biological features, pathways and impacts of the black cherry in its secondary range. Management measures to be potentially included in specific action plans are also summarised.
