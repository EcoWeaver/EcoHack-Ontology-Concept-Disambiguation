First non-native crustacean established in coastal waters of Alaska
Relatively few non-native species are known from coastal ecosystems at high latitudes to date. We examined the fouling community in Alaska for the presence of the marine amphipod Caprella mutica, which is native to the northwestern Pacific Ocean and has invaded many different global regions. Between 2000 and 2007, fouling panels were deployed in 6 sheltered, shallow bays in Alaska. C. mutica were detected on panels at 4 of these bays, ranging from southeastern Alaska (Ketchikan) to the Aleutian Islands (Dutch Harbor), and have been present in Alaska for at least 6 yr. This appears to be the first reported occurrence of a non-native marine species in the Aleutians and also the first confirmation that a non-native crustacean has established self-sustaining populations in Alaska. These data contribute to growing evidence that coastlines in Alaska are susceptible to biological invasions.
