Introduction to the Special Issue: Ungulates and invasive species: quantifying impacts and understanding interactions.
High densities of white-tailed deer negatively impact ecosystems in parts of North America, many of which are also impacted by invasive plants. Whether plant invasions are a result of high deer population, and how deer and invasives interact in their impacts, are not well understood. This motivated a colloquium at the 2016 Botanical Society of America meeting. Nine of those presentations were expanded for this special issue of AoB PLANTS, "Interactions between white-tailed deer and invasive plants in North American forests." This Introduction to this issue highlights the context of the problems and summarizes and synthesizes insights from these papers.
