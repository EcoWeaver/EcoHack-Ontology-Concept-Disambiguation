Genetic variation and structure in the expanding moss Pogonatum dentatum (Polytrichaceae) in its area of origin and in a recently colonized area
Genetic variation in the expanding moss species Pogonatum dentatum was studied using intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. The genetic consequences of range expansion were studied by comparing source populations in a mountain area with populations from a recently colonized lowland area in Sweden. Indices of genetic variation show slightly lower number of alleles per locus in the lowlands and a similar gene diversity in both areas. Three of four lowland populations had evidence of a recently passed bottleneck. Considerably higher haplotype diversity was found in the recently colonized lowlands compared to source populations in the mountains. Patterns of allelic diversity suggest that P. dentatum experiences loss of genetic variation through founder effects and genetic drift when expanding its distribution range. Higher haplotypic diversity, less linkage disequilibrium, and fewer compatible loci indicate that sexual recombination is relatively more important in the lowlands compared to the mountains. A likely explanation is higher success of establishment from spores in the lowlands, while clonal propagation predominates in the mountains. Less genetic differentiation among lowland populations indicates more gene flow in the lowland area, involving more spores and/or fragments moving among populations.
