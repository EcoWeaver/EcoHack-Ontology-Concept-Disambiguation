Ostracod (Crustacea) colonization of a native and a non-native macrophyte species of Hydrocharitaceae in the Upper Parana floodplain (Brazil): an experimental evaluation
Non-native aquatic macrophytes have invaded different types of ecosystems all over the world. The exotic submersed macrophyte Hydrillaverticillata recently invaded the Parana basin, Brazil, being recorded by the first time in the natural habitats of this river in 2005. We investigated the effects of this species on ostracod assemblages and compared the abundance, richness, and Shannon-Wiener diversity of ostracod assemblages that colonize the invading species with those that colonize Egerianajas, a native submersed species with similar architecture and physical complexity. Fragments of these two species were left for 28days in tanks to root and grow and then they were transferred to a floodplain lake where they remained in pairs (one plant of each species; N=7) during 30days for colonization by ostracods. A detrented correspondence analysis was used to summarize ostracod assemblage composition. Although there were no significant differences in ostracod abundance, richness and Shannon diversity when analyzed separately, cumulative curves, which permit to eliminate effects of abundance on richness, indicated a significantly higher number of ostracod species on H.verticillata. Assemblage composition was significantly different between both plant species, as shown by the first DCA axis. Our results show that H.verticillata might provide favorable habitats for native ostracod assemblages. KeywordsFloodplain-Parana River-Invasion- Hydrillaverticillata
