Haplotype diversity in the mtDNA cyt b gene in round goby (Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas)) from the northwestern part of the Black Sea basin
To study the genetic causes of successful biological invasion, haplotype diversity in the mtDNA cyt b locus was examined in populations of the round goby Neogobius malanostomus (Pallas): (Gobidae, Piscs) from the Black Sea basin, which is considered to be the main source of irruption. It was demonstrated that the haplotype diversity of this species was much higher than was assessed earlier. At the population level, a statistically significant association of haplotype diversity with the individual variation of plastic characters was established.
