Regional ecological risk assessment for the introduction of Gambusia affinis (western mosquitofish) into Montana watersheds
Qualitative risk assessment methodologies were used to assess the risk of establishment and consequent impacts on native minnows and species of concern (SOC) associated with the intentional or unintentional introduction of the mosquito biological control agent, Gambusia affinis, to various Montana watersheds. Gambusia affinis introductions for mosquito control have been made throughout the world; some introductions have resulted in deleterious effects on native species. We used average January water temperatures, the presence of dams, and the presence of native minnows and SOC to define endpoints for our assessment. Our results suggest that a section of the Missouri River running between Wolf Creek and Landusky had the highest overall risk score, which corresponds to the highest likelihood of establishment and effects on native minnows and SOC. We also demonstrate how rivers with the highest temperatures are not necessarily at the highest risk of having deleterious effects on minnows and SOC; conversely, these rivers were found to be at highest risk of a population of G.affinis establishing.
