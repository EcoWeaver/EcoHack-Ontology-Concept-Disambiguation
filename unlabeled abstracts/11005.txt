Highly variable microsatellite loci for studies of introduced populations of the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus)
During their introduction, non-native species typically undergo founder events that reduce genetic variation. To allow a high-resolution genetic investigation of introduced populations of the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus), we developed primers for nine variable microsatellite loci. Their applicability was assessed in 10 mongooses from the large Fijian population, which originated from a single pair from Calcutta, India. The number of alleles ranged from two to five per locus, possibly as a result of preservation of initial variability and in situ mutations during the rapid population expansion after introduction.
