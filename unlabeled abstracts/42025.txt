A new Aceria species (Acari:Trombidiformes: Eriophyoidea) from West Asia, a potential biological control agent for the invasive weed camelthorn, Alhagi maurorum Medik. (Leguminosae)
A new species of eriophyoid mite Aceria alhagi n. sp. inhabiting the weed Alhagi maurorum Medik., is described from the type locality in Iran, but it was also collected from Uzbekistan, Turkey and Armenia. This mite causes changes of the leaves and inflorescence. Infested plants develop cauliflower-like galls on the inflorescence and leaves deforming the reproductive structures and inhibiting seed production. The potential reduction in seed set suggests that this mite could constitute a potential biological control agent against this noxious weed. To investigate intraspecific variability between A. alhagi n. sp. populations from Iran, Turkey and Armenia, we analysed molecular sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (mtCOI). These results indicated that there are no significant intraspecific divergences among populations of A.alhagi n. sp. from the five different localities in three West Asia countries. This finding can be used in the future research of certain mite populations as biological control agent.
