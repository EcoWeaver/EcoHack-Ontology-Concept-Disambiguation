Fuel characteristics of the invasive shrub Teline monspessulana (L.) K. Koch
Some broom species have the ability to modify elements of the fire regime in invaded areas. One such species, Teline monspessulana (Syn. Genista monspessulana; French Broom), has expanded notoriously in south-central Chile's Mediterranean climate. The biota of this area may be particularly vulnerable to effects of invasive species on the fire regime, as it is less adapted to wildfires. The properties of the fuel accumulated in T. monspessulana populations of different ages are characterised in this paper. For this, models were constructed to estimate fuel accumulation in T. monspessulana populations, and tests for flammability of foliage were also performed. The results show that the rapid growth of this invasive shrub ensures a significant accumulation of fuel (close to 90 ton ha-1) in periods shorter than a decade, which may influence the severity of wildfires. Further, the fuel has a significant accumulation of fine material and high flammability, both of which may facilitate the ignition of fires. The large volume and high flammability of the fuel accumulated in T. monspessulana populations can thus play an important role in changing the fire regime in areas where it has invaded.
