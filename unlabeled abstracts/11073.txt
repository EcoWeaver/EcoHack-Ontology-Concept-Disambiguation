Nontarget Effect of Entomophagous Biocontrol: Shared Parasitism Between Native Lepidopteran Parasitoids and the Biocontrol AgentTrigonospila brevifacies(Diptera: Tachinidae) in Forest Habitats
The parasitoid guild attacking preimaginal Tortricidae on shrubs and small trees in broadleaf/podocarp forests was studied at six sites in the central North Island. Connectance and quantitative webs were used to interpret the complexities of host parasitoid interactions at a community level and identify competition between native parasitoids and the introduced species Trigonospila brevifacies (Hardy). Trigonospila brevifacies is numerically dominant in the tortricid parasitoid guild. Its host range overlaps with 12 native and one introduced parasitoid species, and it parasitizes more species of Tortricidae than other parasitoids at the North Island forest sites surveyed. Quantification of the parasitoid load on native Lepidoptera indicated that T. brevifacies parasitism comprised between 15.6 and 79.5% of the parasitoid load per species. Only the introduced Australian canefruit pest Eutorna phaulocosma Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae) received a higher proportion of parasitism from T. brevifacies than any of the native Lepidoptera. The number of parasitoid species attacking each preimaginal host stage (except for pupae) of native Lepidoptera was relatively constant. The only pupal parasitoid recorded was the introduced ichneumonid Xanthopimpla rhopaloceros Krieger (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). All native parasitoid species were less abundant than T. brevifacies.
