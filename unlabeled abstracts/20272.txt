First detailed report of brood parasitoidism in the invasive population of the paper wasp Polistes dominulus (Hymenoptera, Vespidae) in North America
The European paper wasp Polistes dominulus (Christ) is a model system in the fields of behavioral ecology, ecological immunology, and invasion biology. Since its introduction to the US in 1978, its invasion success has been attributed, in part, to a lack of parasites or parasitoids infecting this population. This is despite the number of parasites which infest the native population and the generalist polistine parasites and parasitoids documented in sympatric North American species. Multiple studies have cited low parasite pressure as evidence that the invasive population of P. dominulus is benefiting from a post-invasion release from enemies. Here, we present the first well documented case of parasitoidism of the invasive population of P. dominulus in North America.
