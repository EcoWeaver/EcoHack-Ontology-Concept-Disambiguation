Redescription and Immature Stages of Promalactis suzukiella (Matsumura) (Gelechioidea: Oecophoridae), A New Introduction into the United States
Promalactis suzukiella (Matsumura) was discovered independently several times over the past 5 years throughout the northeastern United States by private collectors and biophotographers. These discoveries represent the first records of this species in the United States and validate its approximate distributional range. Color photographs and a redescription of the adult, including the male and female genitalia, are provided. The larva and pupa of Promalactis are described in detail for the first time, with scanning electron micrographs and chaetotaxal maps. A lectotype for Borkhausenia suzukiella Matsumura, 1931, is designated herein. The importance of "backyard collecting" and amateur biophotography is emphasized, and participants are encouraged to continue the documentation of their findings through meetings, publication, and the internet.
