A multifaceted ecological assessment reveals the invasion of the freshwater red macroalga <i>Montagnia macrospora</i> (Batrachospermales, Rhodophyta) in Taiwan
Invasive freshwater macroalgae are rarely described. Montagnia macrospora is a freshwater red alga introduced from South America to East Asia via the global aquarium trade. The earliest occurrence record of this alga in Taiwan is dated 2005. To determine whether M. macrospora has become invasive in Taiwan and to understand the traits that facilitated its invasion, we took a multifaceted approach that combines examination of ecological background and population genetic analysis. Our island-wide survey showed that M. macrospora is widespread in the field across Taiwan, where the climate greatly differs from that of South America, and can self-sustain for nearly a decade. Our population genetic analysis revealed a lack of genetic diversity of M. macrospora in Taiwan, consistent with the hypothesis that the alga expanded through asexual reproduction. Moreover, during our long-term ecological assessments and field surveys, we observed that M. macrospora is an ecological generalist that can survive in a wide range of temperature, pH, illumination, and nutrient enrichment. Taken together, our data suggest that M. macrospora has successfully invaded the freshwater ecosystems of Taiwan, likely due to its ability to disperse asexually and to grow under broad environmental conditions. We hope that our study brings attention to invasive freshwater algae, which have been overlooked in conservation planning and management. Studies of freshwater red algae that combine several aspects of freshwater macroalgae biology and invasion biology, such as ours, are rare. Our study fills an important knowledge gap that will aid in the conservation planning and management of invasive freshwater red macroalgae that are overlooked or are yet to be discovered.
