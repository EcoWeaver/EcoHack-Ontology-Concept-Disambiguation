Effects of Herbivory on Growth and Biomass Allocation in Native and Introduced Species of Lonicera
We compared growth and biomass allocation patterns of Lonicera japonica, an invasive vine in the southeastern United States, and its native congener, L. sempervirens, among three herbivory treatments. Growth and biomass variables were calculated at nine harvest dates across 14 mo under no herbivory, insect herbivory, and mammal and insect herbivory. In the absence of herbivory, L. sempervirens accumulated greater biomass and had higher growth rates than L. japonica. Lonicera sempervirens, however, experienced more herbivore damage than L. japonica, particularly due to the combined effects of insect and mammal herbivory. Total biomass accumulation and greater allocation to leaves and stems indicate a compensatory response to herbivory by L. japonica. These attributes in response to herbivory coupled with lower herbivory in its new range compared to L. sempervirens could give L. japonica a substantial advantage over its native congener.
