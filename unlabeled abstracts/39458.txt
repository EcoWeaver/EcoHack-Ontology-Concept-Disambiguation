Assessment of prescribed fire and cutting as means of controlling the invasion of sub-alpine grasslands by Echinospartum horridum
Subalpine grassland ecosystems have some of the highest biodiversity in Europe and constitute high-value natural resources. These grasslands have been under threat because of the abandonment of traditional agro-pastoral activities and subsequent invasion by woody species. In the Central Pyrenees (Spain), several management techniques have been used to stop the expansion of the highly encroaching shrub Echinospartum horridum. However, the ways in which these techniques affect the recovery of subalpine grasslands are poorly understood. The final goal of this study is to gain information about the effects of the E. horridum management practices an provide recommendations for the local stakeholders.
