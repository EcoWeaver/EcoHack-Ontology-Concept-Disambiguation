Evolutionary cause of the vulnerability of insular communities
Communities on oceanic islands are considered to be vulnerable to biological invasion. However, because the detailed structures of such communities have not yet been revealed, the relationship between their vulnerability and structure is not clear. Because such communities evolved without biological invasion, they are expected to have structures different from those of mainland communities, and this difference is expected to affect their vulnerability to invasion. I conducted computer simulations based on a food web model and investigated the difference in structure between mainland and insular model communities, the former of which evolved with frequent invasion and the latter without invasion. In addition, by conducting computer simulations of invasion of these model communities, I investigated the relationship between community structure and vulnerability to biological invasion. The insular model community evolved to have an unstable structure, in that a small number of plant species supported a large number of animal species, and each species in the community had a small biomass. When a plant species invaded and disturbed the base of the insular model community, many animal species relying on the plants easily became extinct. In addition, when a carnivorous species invaded, animal species with small biomass tended to become extinct. Community collapses caused by biological invasion occurred more frequently in the insular model community than in the mainland model community. These results indicated that those communities that evolved without invasion were vulnerable to invasion. The available data on real insular communities suggest that some have reached the endangered state predicted by this model.
