Restoration of Plant and Animal Communities in a Sanitary Landfill: A 10-year Case Study in Hong Kong
This study was conducted in the South East New Territories (SENT) landfill in Hong Kong, with the objectives to 1) investigate the plant and animal communities establishment and performance within ten years after restoration, and 2) provide important information on pioneer plants species selection recommendations for restoring sanitary landfills. The studying sites were re-vegetated in 2003, with fourteen pioneer plant species, including Acacia auriculiformis, Acacia confusa, and Schefflera heptaphylla, planted. In total, four permanent quadrat (10m x 10m) were used for monitoring at three restored sites (site E, N, and S) and the control site C. The soil properties, plant and animal communities inside plots were investigated annually in summer and winter between 2003 and 2014. The similarity of plant and animal communities between the restored and control sites were compared using Jaccard's index. Ten years after restoration, animal and plant communities were gradually established at all sites. No animal was introduced into the restored sites in 2003, however, there were 29, 31, and 44 animal species recorded at site E, N, and S respectively between 2003 and 2012. Within the studying period, 38 plant species (trees: 52.63%, shrub: 21.05%, herbs: 23.68%, climber: 2.63%) were recorded in all sites and 17 (36.84 %) of them were self-seeding. Exotic species, such as those from the Family Acacia, and Mimosaceae were dominant at all restored sites, which implies that exotic species are more competitive and suitable to be used as pioneer species in sanitary landfill restoration.
