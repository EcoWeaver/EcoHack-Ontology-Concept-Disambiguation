New Invasive Insects Associated with Oak Forests in Lebanon
Moussa, Z., E. Choueiri and A. Hanna. 2021. New Invasive Insects Associated with Oak Forests in Lebanon. Arab Journal of Plant Protection, 39(2): 164-172. Oak forests (Fagaceae) are native in Lebanon and occupy the largest areas of approximately 40,000 ha. The most common species are Quercus calliprinos, Q. infectoria, Q. cerris var. pseudo cerris and Q. brantii. Due to climate change and human activities, oak forests have become more vulnerable to native and exotic invasive pests. A total of 26 insect species associated with oak trees were recently identified in Lebanon. The most dangerous insect pest is the gypsy moth Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera), on Q. calliprinos and Q. Cerris. The oak leafminer Phyllonorycter libanotica (Lepidoptera) and the Eriophidae (Accari) are the most species recorded on Q. infectoria and Q. calliprinos followed by the giant mealybug Ceroputo pilosellae (Hemiptera) on Q. infectoria and Q. calliprinos and the oak moth Thaumetopoea sp. (Lepidoptera) on Q. calliprinos and Q. Cerris. Eight new species were recorded for the first time in Lebanon on oak and are listed in this paper. Five species of Cinipidae (Hymenoptera): Andricus caputmedusae, A. cecconi, A. sternlichti, Plagiotrochus quercusilicis and Neuroterus quercusbaccarum, one species of Scolytidae, Xylosandrus compactus (Coleoptera), one species of Kermesidae Kermes echinatus (Hemiptera) and one species of Diaspididae, Koroneaspis aegilopos (Hemiptera).
