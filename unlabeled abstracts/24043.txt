Military Training and Road Effects onImperata cylindrica(L.) Beauv. (Cogongrass)
Type, level, and intensity of human activities may facilitate establishment and spread of invasive plant species. A better understanding of how human activities influence invasion can assist land managers in developing strategies for control and monitoring of invasive plants. Spread of the invasive species Imperata cylindrica (Cogongrass) has been attributed to human activities. During 2002-2004, on Camp Shelby Training Site, MS, we investigated relationships between military activity and establishment and growth of Cogongrass. In areas of soil disturbance from military equipment, vegetative linear growth rates of 7-10 m yr-1 were recorded on firing points. There was a positive relationship between military troop use and Cogongrass establishment on firing points for one of the 2 years of the study (P = 0.023). Thus, steps to minimize soil disturbance in and near Cogongrass may reduce spread. We examined frequency of Cogongrass infestation and vegetative growth rates for roadside areas along gravel roads subject to at least annual mowing and grading, and dirt tracks receiving infrequent maintenance. Cogongrass spread and establishment on roadsides did not differ for the two road types (P >= 0.116). These results may reflect activities already in place to reduce disturbance of Cogongrass patches.
