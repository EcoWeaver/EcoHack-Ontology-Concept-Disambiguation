Changes in the representation of alien taxa in ruderal vegetation of an urban ecosystem over 50 years. A case study from Malacky city, Slovakia, Central Europe
This paper analyses changes in the representation of alien taxa in ruderal vegetation of a model urban ecosystem. Two datasets of phytosociological releves of ruderal communities from the area of Malacky (a city in southwestern Slovakia) were analysed. The releves were recorded 50 years apart, the old releves were recorded in the years 1954-1969 and the more recent releves in the years 2014-2015. The average values of percentage number and percentage cover of archaeophytes and neophytes as groups in old and more recent datasets were compared. We also calculated the proportion of each taxon of archaeophytes and neophytes in ruderal vegetation in both periods. The results revealed a decrease in the average percentage number and percentage cover of archaeophytes in almost all classes of ruderal vegetation between the new and old dataset. On the contrary, an increase in representation of neophytes in all classes was recorded. Some rare taxa of archaeophytes were only recorded 50 years ago (e.g. Veronica opaca, Xanthium stumarium), while many taxa of neophytes (including some invasive taxa e.g. Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Stenactis annua) were only recorded in the years 2014-2015 in the ruderal vegetation of the urban ecosystem of Malacky.
