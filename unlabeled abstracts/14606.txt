Phenological dynamics of the invasive plantAcacia longifoliain Portugal
Phenological shifts may play an important role in the success of invasive species. In the coastal regions of continental Portugal, Acacia longifolia is one of the most widespread invasive plants, but there are significant gaps in our understanding and interpretation of its phenology. This study is the first to investigate the phenological variation of A. longifolia and its association with climate in populations representing a temperature and precipitation gradient in mainland Portugal. The results highlighted significant variations in the vegetative (leaf initiation) and reproductive phenophases (bud formation, flowering and fruiting) among populations. Overall, leafing was observed throughout the year, bud formation occurred between summer and spring, anthesis between late winter and the beginning of spring, and fruiting started in late winter. Most of the reproductive phenophases varied across elevation or latitudinal gradients, with populations that were subjected to more stressful climatic conditions advancing their flowering and fruiting phenophases. The occurrence of each phenophase was strongly associated with the climatic conditions in the previous 5-12 months, suggesting that plants receive their phenological cues well in advance of their phenological response. Among climatic factors, temperature and irradiance were the most significant predictors of the phenological cycle of A. longifolia, but precipitation also exerted a greater influence on budding and flowering of the species. The phenological response of A. longifolia in a variety of sites represents an important step towards understanding how its phenology may react to the projected climate change in the Mediterranean region.
