Effects of an Insecticide and Potential Predators on Green Frogs and Northern Cricket Frogs
Worldwide amphibian population declines have occurred in the last few decades and have been attributed to a range of factors including introduced species and chemical contamination. Anuran species may differ in their susceptibility to declines based on life-history characteristics, leading to different probabilities of decline and conservation statuses. In this experiment, we looked at two anuran species, Northern Cricket Frogs (Acris crepitans) and Green Frogs (Rana clamitans), reared in mesocosms containing a common invasive or introduced potential predator (Rusty Crayfish, Bluegill Sunfish, or triploid Grass Carp) and imidacloprid, a common insecticide. We found that anurans differed in their sensitivity to these factors. Cricket Frog survival was significantly reduced with imidacloprid exposure, whereas Green Frogs were not. Abundance of both amphibian species was reduced in the presence of predators, particularly the fish. Our study suggests that Cricket Frogs may be especially sensitive to the insecticide imidacloprid, as well as fish predators, and that these factors could contribute to their population declines.
