Tackling biological invasions in Natura 2000 network in the light of the new EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030
The European Commission has recently adopted its EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, which sets out an ambitious plan for reversing biodiversity loss, and preserving and restoring protected ecosystems. A central binding target is focused on enlarging the EU network of legally protected areas (Natura 2000, the largest global network of the world), and on maintaining or improving the conservation status of all vulnerable habitats and species included in them. Biological invasions are currently a major threat to Natura 2000, so fulfilling the objectives of the EU Biodiversity Strategy calls for stepping up the implementation and enforcement of the relevant legislation on the matter, which has been thoroughly revised over the last decade. We discuss here the regulatory aspects of legislation on invasive alien species (IAS) that need to be optimised to address the challenge posed by biological invasions to the Natura 2000 network in the light of the new EU Biodiversity Strategy. We highlight that, while the EU has designed a solid regulatory framework to tackle the threat of biological invasions, its successful implementation will mainly rely upon appropriate national enforcement and allocation of economic and human resources. Despite previous warnings, the creation of dedicated EU funding mechanisms to support a comprehensive implementation of the legislation still remains a priority. Due to the yet small number of IAS regulated at the EU level, prevention and management of IAS will largely depend on national and local administration efforts, and on regional coordination and cooperation across neighbouring countries. Therefore, a well-integrated system responsible for biosecurity, pests and invasive alien organisms at the EU level would be better accomplished through a centralized, independent EU agency of new creation. Likewise, the establishment of a similar lead agency at the MS level, with special focus on IAS management in Natura 2000, is recommended to navigate the existing complex regulatory framework.
