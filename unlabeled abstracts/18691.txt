Drivers of Central European urban land snail faunas: the role of climate and local species pool in the representation of native and non-native species
The importance of macroclimate and dispersal limitation in the broad-scale variation of European urban land snail assemblages is likely to differ between native and non-native species because of the southern origin of many non-native snails, often spread by humans. We sampled land snails in each of 32 European cities and compiled from the literature a list of land snail species reported from the surroundings of each city. To quantify the predictive power of climate and local species pools, beta-sim dissimilarity matrices of both native and non-native species were explored using MDS and RDA ordination methods, Mantel tests with bootstrapping of each dataset, and multivariate homogeneity analysis of group variances. We observed no significant relation between the numbers of non-native species found in the cities and their surroundings (p > 0.133), while the percentage of native species in the cities derived from their local species pools decreased significantly with the increasing species richness of local faunas (rS = -0.75, p < 0.001). Assemblage variation of urban native species was explained mostly by the difference between mean January and July temperatures (21.3 %), with the major role of July temperature (18.0 %). In contrast, variation of non-native species assemblages was mainly explained by January temperature (19.9 %). The congruence in faunal similarities between the cities and the surrounding areas was higher in native (r = 0.46, p < 0.001) than in non-native species (r = 0.36, p < 0.001). Overall native faunas were significantly more homogeneous than the non-native faunas. Our results suggest that recent climate warming may foster geographical expansions of many non-native land snail species as their distributions are controlled mainly by January temperature.
