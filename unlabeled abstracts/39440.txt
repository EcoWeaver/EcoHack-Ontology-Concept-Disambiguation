Overlap in reproductive phenology increases the likelihood of cavity nest usurpation by invasive species in a tropical city
Abstract Multiple invasive cavity-nesting bird species can be present in a nest web, the network linking birds using cavities. We investigated the nest preferences and breeding phenologies of the cavity-nesting guild in the region surrounding Miami, Florida, USA, where invasive starlings, mynas, and parrots potentially usurp cavities from native woodpeckers and secondary cavity-nesters. We asked if the timing of reproduction determines which invasive species will usurp cavities from native birds with similar nest preferences. Nest usurpations between European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and the woodpecker species present in Miami is well documented, but we predicted that a recently arrived sturnid species and introduced psittacids would also usurp nests. European Starlings had the largest breeding population of any species in our nest web, breeding during the peak of nesting season, and usurped the largest number of active nest cavities. We found that a small population of Common Mynas (Acridotheres tristis) usurped nests, sharing the peak-season nesting period with starlings and native woodpeckers. Parrots bred later than we expected, avoiding nest-site overlap with similarly large native birds that use cavities with similar characteristics. Parrots did not usurp any active nest cavities from native birds. Our results demonstrate how to use analysis of cavity characteristics and reproductive timing to evaluate threats to a cavity nest web posed by multiple invasive species. Common Myna currently usurp few nests; if they increase greatly in population, they could pose a problem for native cavity-nesters.
