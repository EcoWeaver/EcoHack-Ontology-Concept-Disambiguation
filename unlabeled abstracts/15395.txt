Stakeholder perceptions of red lionfish ( Pterois volitans ) as a threat to the ecosystem and its potential for human consumption in Quintana Roo, Mexico
The invasion of red lionfish, Pterois volitans (hereafter lionfish), in the Atlantic Ocean has been a matter of concern among scientist, managers, and stakeholders. Managers and scientists of the region have responded to this invasion by promoting consumption as a measure of population control. The present study provides information regarding perceptions of stakeholders (diver-fishermen, restaurant owners, and fish consumers) related to the lionfish invasion as a threat to fisheries, as well as lionfish consumption in Cozumel and Puerto Morelos, Mexico. For both locations, all stakeholders perceived lionfish as a threat to the local fisheries and ecosystem, but diver-fishermen and fish consumers perceived lionfish as a resource to provide benefits through human consumption; all stakeholders showed high willingness to taste and consume lionfish. The information derived from stakeholder perceptions can be a useful tool to better understand the socio-ecological context related to a biological invasion. This information can provide key elements guiding management strategies to the lionfish invasion, and other marine invasive species, in the region.
