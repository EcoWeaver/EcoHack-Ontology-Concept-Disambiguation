The Effect of Feral Dogs and Other Alien Species on Native Mammals of Isla de Cedros, Mexico
We report the status of alien species on Isla de Cedros, Mexico, and analyze the information from different years that together with a collaborative effort between academic biologists, Mexican governmental agencies, and local individuals has resulted in major information about the alien species on this island. We also report species richness of distinct endemic mammal species and the presence of feral dogs (Canis lupus familiaris Linnaeus), which is the principal problematic situation in this "Marine Priority Region." The possible origin of feral dogs could be the migratory movement of stray dogs to find food in the inner part of the island, first moving to garbage dumps, reproducing in the area, and later hunting goats (Capra aegagrus hircus Linnaeus) in packs. The combination of the high density of stray dogs, urban and industrial food garbage dumps, and the large number of marine resources scattered along the seashore made ideal conditions for the establishment of feral dog packs that are affecting native species. The island does not have any natural mammal predator, but the presence of feral species, dogs and cats (Felis silvestris catus Schreber), could disturb the occurrence of endemic fauna as it has happened on other islands in the world.
