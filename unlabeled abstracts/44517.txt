Grappling with Weeds: Invasive Species and Hybrid Landscapes in Cape York Peninsula, Far Northeast Australia
The control of various introduced species brings to the fore questions around how species are categorised as 'native' or 'invasive', belonging or not belonging. In far north Queensland, Australia, the Cape York region is a complex mixture of land tenures, including pastoral leases, National Parks and Aboriginal land, and overlapping management agreements. Weed control comprises much of the work that land managers in Cape York do. However, different land managers target different introduced species for control, and the ways in which certain species are understood as more or less problematic indicate how land managers understand and seek to order landscapes. Through investigating the various positions that introduced species occupy, I will explore how Cape York emerges as a 'hybrid landscape' that is produced in contested, overlapping and ambiguous ways, and is rife with 'feral dynamics'.
