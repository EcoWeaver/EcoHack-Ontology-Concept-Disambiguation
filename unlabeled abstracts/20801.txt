Invasion of alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) in Wular Lake, Kashmir, India
Editor's note: This special issue of Aquatic Invasions includes papers from the 17th International Conference on Aquatic Invasive Species held in San Diego, California, USA, on August 29 to September 2, 2010. This conference has provided a venue for the exchange of information on various aspects of aquatic invasive species since its inception in 1990. The conference continues to provide an opportunity for dialog between academia, industry and environmental regulators within North America and from abroad. Abstract Alligator weed Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb (Amaranthaceae) is being reported for the first time from Kashmir, India. Alternanthera philoxeroides was collected in 2008 during the vegetation survey of Wular Lake, a wetland of international importance under Ramsar convention. Alternanthera philoxeroides is a noxious invasive weed widespread throughout the world. We suggested that all lakes and wetlands in the Kashmir valley are susceptible to this weed and its growth may assume destructive levels. The morphology and nomenclature of the species is described and illustrated.
