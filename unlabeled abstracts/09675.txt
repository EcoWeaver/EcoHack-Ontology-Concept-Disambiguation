Haplotype diversity of mtCOI in the fall webworm Hyphantria cunea (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) in introduced regions in China, Iran, Japan, Korea, and its homeland, the United States
Hyphantria cunea (Drury) has colonized many countries outside its native range of North America and has become a model species for studies of the colonization and subsequent adaptation of agricultural pests. Molecular genetic analyses can clarify the origin and subsequent adaptations to non-native habitats. Using the mitochondrial COI gene, we examined the genetic relationships between invasive populations (China, Iran, Japan, and Korea) and native populations (i.e., the United States). The Jilin (China) and Guilan (Iran) populations showed nine previously unknown haplotypes that differed from those found in the south-central United States, suggesting multiple colonization events and different regions of invasion. A dominant mtDNA haplotype in populations in the United States was shared by all of the populations investigated, suggesting that H. cunea with that haplotype have successfully colonized China, Iran, Japan, and Korea.
