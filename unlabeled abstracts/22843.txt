Salinity-related distribution of alien amphipods in rivers provides refugia for native species
There are numerous papers upon the range extension, biology and the impact of alien amphipods upon the local fauna. However, there are no studies concerning the alien versus native species distribution patterns at the catchment scale of river systems. In total 125 sites were sampled: 41 in main rivers constituting the Polish section of the central invasion corridor (Bug, Vistula, Notec with canals, Oder) and 84 in their affluents. The conductivity of large rivers was much higher than in their small affluents. The number of alien species and their abundance was higher at sites with raised conductivity values. The reverse situation was noticed when native amphipods were taken into account. Moreover, large rivers were inhabited by alien fauna, whereas in smaller streams only native species were sampled. The absence of alien amphipods in small rivers may be explained by their ecological preference for a higher conductivity of water. Thus in smaller streams the native fauna is free from the pressure posed by alien amphipods. If not degraded by human activity, small affluents may function as refugia for native amphipod species. Otherwise, elevation of salinity related to improper catchment management or sewage treatment may lead to extinction of such local disjunct population of native amphipods.
