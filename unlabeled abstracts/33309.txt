Assemblages of Rodents in Riparian Forests Along the Rio Grande in Big Bend National Park, Texas: Current and Historic Insights on the Effects of Invasion by Saltcedars
Comparisons of assemblages of rodents along the Rio Grande in Big Bend National Park, Brewster County, Texas, were made using recent (2009-2010) and historic (1977) data to evaluate the effects of invasion by saltcedars (Tamarix). Comparisons of abundances and species of rodents between sites with mesquites (Prosopis), cottonwoods (Populus), or saltcedars revealed no significant difference between habitats. Comparisons of recent and historic assemblages of rodents suggested low turnover of species, but structure of assemblages differed between studies. The western harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys megalotis) was an addition to the riparian fauna and neither the silky pocket mouse (Perognathus flavus) nor Nelson's pocket mouse (Chaetodipus nelsoni) was captured during the recent assessment. Differences in assemblages may be caused by shifts in riparian plants toward a more closed canopy or by recolonization following flooding.
