Optimization of intervention levels in ecological restoration
QuestionAre optimal intervention levels in ecological restoration linked to disturbance severity or spatial and temporal scales of restoration activities in the studies included in this special feature? Methods Comparison of ten studies of restoration in the context of disturbance severity, regional biodiversity, and predictability of succession trajectories. ResultsThe ten studies largely represent restoration of grasslands in Europe but also include restoration following disturbances by mining, invasive species, and trampling by tourists. Maximal intervention levels were used in studies with high or low disturbance severity, low regional biodiversity, and high predictability of successional trajectories. The spatial and temporal scales of restoration activities had little effect on intervention levels. Conclusions General guidelines on how to optimize intervention levels in restoration activities can be sought by comparing success rates across gradients of disturbance severity.
