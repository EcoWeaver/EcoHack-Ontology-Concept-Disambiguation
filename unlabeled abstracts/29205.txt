Forecasting impact of existing and emerging invasive gobiids under temperature change using comparative functional responses
Round goby Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814) and western tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris (Heckel, 1837) have recently expanded substantially beyond their native ranges, posing a threat to freshwater and brackish ecosystems. Both species exert a detrimental effect on fish community structure directly via predation on fish eggs and indirectly via alterations of food webs. While the impact of N. melanostomus is widely documented, P. semilunaris receives little attention and its effect on aquatic communities has not yet been quantified. We compared aspects of their predation on common carp Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758 larvae at 20 degC and 25 degC using the functional response (FR) approach, which has been developed and applied to forecast invader impact. Intra-specific comparison showed no significant temperature dependency on assessed FR parameters, attack rate and handling time, suggesting broad temperature tolerance of both tested predators. Proterorhinus semilunaris demonstrated a marginally higher attack rate at 20 degC compared to N. melanostomus. The handling times did not differ between predators. Proterorhinus semilunaris showed a lower maximum feeding rate at 25 degC compared to the rest of treatments suggesting lower temperature optima compared to N. melanostomus. Both predators showed substantial maximum feeding rates, which may impact recruitment of native fish species.
