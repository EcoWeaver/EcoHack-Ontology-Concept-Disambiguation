Helminth infracommunity of the cane toad Rhinella marina (Anura: Bufonidae) within its native distribution range
During August 2010, a total of 66 cane toad Rhinella marina were collected in Laguna de Coyuca, Guerrero, Mexico and examined for the presence of helminths. Ninety-two percent were parasitized by 1 or more parasite species. A total of 4624 individuals were found, belonging to 8 helminth taxa (1 digenean, 1 cestode and 6 nematodes). Infracommunities harbored by this host species are highly variable (mean Jaccard similarity index 0.31 +- 0.27); mean percent similarity index 0.26 +- 0.32) and depauperate (mean richness 1.91 +- 0.92; mean abundance 64.4 +- 100.34); almost 50% of them were dominated by Rhabdias fuelleborni, a skin-penetrating nematode. Differences related to host gender and size were found, since males registered infracommunities with lower species richness and diversity than females. The reproductive condition of females (collected during the breeding season) might explain the results obtained; during this season, females invest less in resistance to infection in favor of investing resources in reproduction. However, confirmation of this statement can only be made by sampling in the dry season, when the toads do not reach their reproductive peak.
