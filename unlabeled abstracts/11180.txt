Detection of a new non-native freshwater species by DNA metabarcoding of environmental samples -- first record of Gammarus fossarum in the UK
We report the discovery of a non-native gammarid, Gammarus fossarum (Koch, 1836) (Crustacea, Amphipoda), in UK rivers. Gammarus fossarum is a common freshwater gammarid in many parts of mainland Europe, but was previously considered absent from the UK. Gammarus fossarum was detected in a number of UK rivers following DNA metabarcoding of a mini-barcode region of the COI gene in macroinvertebrate kick samples, and environmental DNA (eDNA) from water and sediment samples. Subsequent morphological analysis and standard DNA barcoding showed that the species could be reliably identified and separated from Gammarus pulex (Linnaeus, 1758), the most dominant and widespread native freshwater gammarid in the UK. Our data demonstrate extensive geographical coverage of G. fossarum in the UK, spanning distant river catchments. At present there is no data to confirm the likely origin of G. fossarum's introduction. Subsequent re-examination of historic archive material shows the species to have been present in the UK since at least 1964. This study is among the first to demonstrate the potential of eDNA metabarcoding for detection of new non-native species.
