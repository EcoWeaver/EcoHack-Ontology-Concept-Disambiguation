Rapid and reliable inference of mitochondrial phylogroups among Watersipora species, an invasive group of ship-fouling species (Bryozoa, Cheilostomata)
Tracking biological invasion is an essential part of conservation, and identifying invasive species quickly following an introduction can be imperative. Invasive organisms are often difficult to distinguish visually, which can delay appropriate response measures. We have designed a multiplex-PCR system to effectively distinguish colonies of divergent cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) sequence clades in the bryozoan genus Watersipora, a genus with invasive species which are aggressive foulers of ship hulls, to understand small-scale invasion patterns and the ecology of lineages of different geographic origins. The identification of previously defined COI lineage groups is conducted using PCR reactions containing five primers. Lineage-specific fragment lengths were produced with 100% reliability, suggesting the assay will offer a rapid and economical means of studying invasion dynamics and the role of adaptation in this rapidly invading species complex.
