Macroecology meets invasion ecology: linking the native distributions of Australian acacias to invasiveness
Aim Species' native ranges reflect the net outcome of interactions between life-history strategies and biotic and abiotic influences over evolutionary time-scales. Differences in native ranges might be indicative both of relative historical performance and adaptability to new conditions. Consequently, the native ranges of successful invaders might have distinctive biogeographical characteristics. We test this hypothesis by (1) quantifying macroecological patterns of the entire assemblage of native taxa in Acacia subgenus Phyllodineae in Australia, (2) testing whether highly invasive taxa represent random samples from the patterns observed for the assemblage as a whole and (3) exploring the link between native geographical range and the position of species along the introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum.
