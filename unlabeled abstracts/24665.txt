Estimation of the possibility of cladoceran invasion and survival under conditions of competition in mesotrophic Lake Glubokoe
A possibility of introducing alien cladoceran species into the pelagial zone of mesotrophic Lake Glubokoe has been estimated. For this purpose, observations have been performed on the cohorts of alien species (Daphnia magna and Simocephalus exspinosus) and aboriginal species (Daphnia hyalina and Diaphanosoma brachyurum). The results show that competition is a factor preventing the introduction of weak competitors, such as D. magna, but admitting stronger competitors, e.g., S. exspinosus. Competition in the lake may influence not only the species structure of the zooplanktonic community, but also its vertical distribution.
