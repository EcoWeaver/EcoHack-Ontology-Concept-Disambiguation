Susceptibility of North American Native and Non-native Slugs (Mollusca: Gastropoda) toPhasmarhabditis hermaphrodita(Nematoda: Rhabditidae)
Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita caused significant mortality of the two native species, Deroceras laeve and Leidyula floridana, and of one introduced species D. reticulatum, but not of the other three introduced species, Arion hortensis, A. subfuscus and Limax maximus. Even the juvenile stages of A. subfuscus and L. maximus showed no mortality in nematode treatments. However, treatments with nematodes resulted in rapid and strong feeding inhibition in all six species. Surviving slugs resumed feeding when fresh food was provided. This study expands the host range of P. hermaphrodita to include a new family Vaginulidae and demonstrates the inability of P. hermaphrodita to cause mortality of A. hortensis, A. subfuscus and L. maximus. These three species use feeding suspension as an evasive behavior to escape nematode infection.
