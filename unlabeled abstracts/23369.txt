Seed development and germination ecophysiology of the invasive tree Prunus serotina (Rosaceae) in a temperate forest in Western Europe
Seed development, dormancy and germination of the American invasive tree species, Prunusserotina, are described for plants growing in a large forest in Belgium. Seeds of P.serotina were collected following anthesis in the first week of July and thereafter at fortnightly intervals. Seed dormancy, temperature requirements for germination and the soil seed bank were investigated. At maturation (about 105days after anthesis), seed moisture content had decreased to around 13.7%, and 44% of the seeds had attained the capacity to germinate. Mature seeds of P.serotina exhibited physiological dormancy, germinating only after a long cold, moist stratification period. Highest germination percentage occurred in seeds treated with gibberellic acid (GA3), at 10degC. We found no evidence that P.serotina forms a persistent seed bank but noticed a persistent seedling bank in the field.
