Vermicomposting--An effective tool for the management of invasive weed Parthenium hysterophorus
This study reports the results of vermicomposting with Eisenia fetida of Parthenium hysterophorus mixed with cow dung in different ratios (25%, 50% and 75%) in a 18 weeks experiment. In all the treatments, a decrease in pH, OC(total) and C:N ratio, but increase in EC, N(total), P(aval), Ca(total), K(total) and heavy metals was recorded. The cocoons production and growth rate (biomass gain worm(-1) day(-1)) were maximum in 100% cow dung. The results indicated that parthenium can be a raw material for vermicomposting if mix with cow dung in appropriate quantity.
