Non-native freshwater fishes in Norway: history, consequences and perspectives
At present, there are 43 self-sustaining fish species in Norwegian fresh waters, 11 (26%) of which are non-native, representing four families (Salmonidae, Cyprinidae, Centrarchidae and Ictaluridae). Human-mediated fish introductions probably began in the 15th century with common carp Cyprinus carpio, but most have occurred between the late 1800s and late 1900s. The number of known established populations varies from one (goldfish Carassius auratus) to nearly 250 (tench Tinca tinca). Dispersal risk is also highest with tench, which is being spread by anglers for its appeal as a trophy fish. Intentional introductions to improve amenity angling have been part of fisheries management programmes (e.g. brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis), so this appears to be an increasingly common introduction vector despite the prohibition under legislation of introducing any species of non-native fishes. Some introduced species, such as brook trout, have declined in abundance and number of populations as the quality of acidified waters has been restored, being replaced by native brown trout Salmo trutta. Further range expansion by some species (e.g. common carp, goldfish and pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus) is probably restricted by current climatic conditions.
