Exotic vs endemic biocontrol agents: would the real Stratiolaelaps miles (Berlese) (Acari: Mesostigmata: Laelapidae), please stand up?
The ability of introduced organisms to invade undisturbed native habitats is a major concern in conservation biology and has resulted in a re-evaluation of the introduction of exotic biocontrol agents, especially of generalist predators. One such agent is Stratiolaelaps miles (Berlese), a predatory mite described from Italy, known from throughout the Holarctic, and apparently accidentally introduced to other areas of the world, including Australia. Initial investigations revealed that putative S. miles could be found in both disturbed and relatively pristine habitats in Queensland, Australia. However, analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of five populations showed most to be highly divergent genetically. Subsequent morphological analysis established two species groups: the lamington-group from cool-temperate to subtropical rainforests in Eastern Australia and the more eurytopic miles-group with a cosmopolitan distribution. We describe two new species from each of these complexes (Stratiolaelaps womersleyi, Stratiolaelaps lamington; Stratiolaelaps marilyn, Stratiolaelaps lorna, respectively), and resurrect Stratiolaelaps scimitus (Womersley), a species which often appears to have been confused with S. miles. Additionally, the large genetic distances among morphologically homogenous species in the miles-group suggest that the apparently cosmopolitan S. miles may be composed of a suite of cryptic species of potentially varying utility in biological control.
