Invasion with stage-structured coupled map lattices: Application to the spread of scentless chamomile
Two fundamental aspects of invasion dynamics are population growth and population spread. These quantities have been subject of study in biological invasions and can be used to study management and control of organisms. In this paper we derive formulae to calculate wave speed and rates of spread for coupled map lattices. Coupled map lattice models are dynamical models where space and time are discrete. We also show how wave speed and rate of spread can be calculated for structured population coupled map lattices in deterministic, stochastic environments and heterogeneous landscapes. Coupled map lattices are simple mathematical models that can be easily linked to landscape data to study invading organisms control strategies.
