The invasion window for warmwater fish in clearwater lakes: the role of ultraviolet radiation and temperature
In clear, cold-water lakes, ultraviolet radiation (UV) and temperature are two important stressors that may prevent the establishment of aquatic invasive species by inhibiting the survival of sensitive early life history stages. In this study, we develop a UV-temperature response model to predict the establishment potential of a warmwater fish, largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), in a large subalpine lake based on the ability of bass larvae to tolerate UV and temperature stress along a UV-temperature stress gradient.
