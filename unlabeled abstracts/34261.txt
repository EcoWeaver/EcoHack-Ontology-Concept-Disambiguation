Biological Invasions 2020 Horizon
This special issue points to the necessity to continue actively working on biological invasions, as invasive species remain a main and global threat for biodiversity through a global homogenization process. This issue includes six research papers, covering a large range of taxa, studying new invasive processes and proposing innovative management solutions. The way forward will be to continue working in close relation with other stakeholders and decision-makers, increase communication efforts, solicit societal feedback, and quickly implement consistent legislation.
