The Use of RAPD Markers to Assess Catfish Hybridization
Taiwan's endemic catfish Clarias fuscus is gradually disappearing from its native habitat, and has been proposed for genebank preservation. Environmental pressures, including exotic species interference and habitat destruction, as well as possible competitive advantages of the hybrids over this species. In order to quickly and effectively provide a reliable DNA fingerprint for the pure strain of C. fuscus we used RAPD markers to assess C. fuscus, C. mossambicus, and C.batrachus. Of the 200 primers screened to prime PCR amplification of DNA from wild-caught C. fuscus, 16 yielded reproducible DNA bands. Unique RAPD markers generated from 3 PCR primers (#211, #245 and #287) are shown to be alleles present in the genomes of C. mossambicus but absent in the genome of C. fuscus. Hybrids of C. fuscus and C. mossambicus, therefore, could possibly be distinguished by the use of these specific molecular markers. Catfish caught from the Mingder Dam were then cautiously removed from the preserved stock because of the appearance of hybrid markers in their genomes.
