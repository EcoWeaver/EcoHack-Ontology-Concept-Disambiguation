Artificial macrophytes as fish habitat in a Mediterranean reservoir subjected to seasonal water level disturbances
Artificial macrophytes were experimentally deployed in Boadella Reservoir (NE Spain) and assessed for fish use throughout the first 3 months of the 2007 summer drawdown. In total, 1,832 individuals of seven fish species were recorded through visual censuses, with introduced perch Perca fluviatilis being the prevalent species. Fish richness and abundance were significantly higher in artificial macrophytes than in rocky shores and sandy beaches, displaying a unimodal variation through time. P. fluviatilis, Rutilus rutilus and Abramis brama were significantly more abundant in artificial macrophytes than in the other two naturally submersed habitats, where no individuals of these species were recorded. The abundances of Squalius laietanus, Lepomis gibbosus, Micropterus salmoides and Cyprinus carpio were overall greater in artificial macrophytes than in rocky shores but displayed significant habitat 9 time interactions. A decrease in predation risk was apparently the key-factor of the intensive use of artificial macrophytes by small fish (B100 mm TL) in Boadella Reservoir, since most species reduced drastically or completely the use of submerged structures when body size increased. This study demonstrates that adding artificial structures mimicking aquatic macrophytes can be an interesting tool to mitigate the adverse effects of water level fluctuations on fish assemblages in structure-less and homogeneous ecosystems, and to understand the mechanisms affecting habitat use and species replacement.
