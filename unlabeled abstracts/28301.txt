Population variation of invasive Spartina alterniflora can differentiate bacterial diversity in its rhizosphere
While several studies have documented that invasive plants can change the microbial communities, little is known about how soil microbial communities respond to population variation of invasive plants. Here, nine populations of Spartinaalterniflora were selected from the east coast of China along latitudinal gradient to compare bacterial diversity of rhizospheres among these populations. The bacterial diversity in S.alterniflora rhizospheres was valued by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H') and number of DGGE bands showed that rhizosphere bacterial diversity of S.alterniflora populations increased along a latitudinal gradient when all the populations were grown in a common garden. These findings suggest that population variation of S.alterniflora can differentiate the rhizosphere bacterial diversity, and the latitudinal gradient can shape the specific plant-bacterial diversity relationship. Our results adding to the recent literature suggest that invasive plant-soil biota interactions would have clinal variation with environmental gradients and improve our understanding of the mechanisms and processes of plant invasions.
