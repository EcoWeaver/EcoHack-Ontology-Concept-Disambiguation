Invasion effects of Chromolaena odorata on soil carbon and nitrogen fractions in a tropical savanna
The ecological impacts of biological invasion are generalized with difficulty since these impacts are commonly species- or ecosystem-specific. A noxious invasive plant, Chromolaena odorata, has invaded broad regions, but limited attention has been paid to clarify the ecological impacts of this invasive plant on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage in invaded ecosystems. This study was conducted to investigate changes in the labile and total soil C and N fractions in the surface and subsurface soil layers in non-invaded plots, plots with slight (30%) or severe (100%) invasion, and a restored forest plot with native tree and shrub species within a tropical savanna. Our results showed that different severities of C. odorata invasion induced inconsistent responses of the soil C and N fractions in the investigated tropical savanna. In particular, slight invasion did not alter or decreased the total and labile soil C and N fractions, and severe invasion significantly increased most of the total and labile soil C and N fractions. The encroachment of woody species significantly increased the soil C and N contents, with significantly higher increases than in the invaded plots. Our results suggest that the impacts of invasion on soil C and N fractions could vary depending on invasion severity. Therefore, comparisons of the invaded and non-invaded plots with invasion duration or severity overlooked are likely to result in biased conclusions regarding the invasion-induced ecological consequences in terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, C. odorata invasion can alter soil nutrient conditions according to the needs of C. odorata establishment at different stages and consequently affect the soil C and N contents in this tropical ecosystem.
