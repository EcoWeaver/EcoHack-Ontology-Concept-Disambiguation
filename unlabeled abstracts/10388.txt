Forest dynamics and ungulate herbivory: from leaf to landscape
Due primarily to anthropogenic influences such as land use change, exotic species introductions, livestock grazing, altered hunting regimes, and predator control, wild ungulate populations have undergone tremendous shifts in recent decades. Although the result has been endangerment or extirpation in some regions, ungulate numbers have increased to locally or regionally high levels in other areas, causing shifts in plant species composition, problems for forest regeneration, and conflict with humans and domestic livestock. Our ability to find solutions to these problems is limited because we lack sufficient understanding of how ungulate species interact with predators, habitat, forage, competing species, and humans at multiple scales from small foraging patches to large regions.
