Revisiting the sex pheromone of the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda , a new invasive pest in South China
The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda is a worldwide serious agricultural pest, and recently invades in South China. Sex pheromone can be employed to monitor its population dynamics accurately in the field. However, the pheromone components previously reported by testing different geographic populations and strains are not consistent. On the basis of confirming that the S. frugiperda population from Yunnan province belonged to the corn strain, we analyzed the potential sex pheromone components in the pheromone gland extracts of females using the gas chromatography coupled with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and electroantennography (EAG). The results show that (Z)-9-tetradecenal acetate (Z9-14:Ac), (Z)-11-hexadecenyl acetate (Z11-16:Ac), (Z)-7-dodecenyl acetate (Z7-12:Ac) or (E)-7-dodecenyl acetate (E7-12:Ac) with a ratio of 100: 15.8: 3.9 induced EAD responses to varying degree: Z9-14:Ac elicited a strong EAD response, Z7-12:Ac or E7-12:Ac elicited a small but clear EAD response, while Z11-16:Ac elicited a weak EAD response. The further single sensillum recording (SSR) showed that Z9-14:Ac and Z7-12:Ac induced dose-dependent activities in two types (A and B) of sensilla in male antennae, respectively, while the sensilla in response to E7-12:Ac and Z11-16:Ac was not recorded. Finally, wind tunnel tests reveal that Z9-14:Ac and Z7-12:Ac are two principal sex pheromone components of the tested population. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved
