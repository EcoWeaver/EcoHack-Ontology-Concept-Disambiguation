The "Tilapia Law" encouraging non-native fish threatens Amazonian River basins
Recently, the Governor of Amazonas State (Brazil) sanctioned the law 79/2016, which allows the aquaculture with non-native fishes (e.g., tilapia) in Amazonian aquatic ecosystems. Here, we argue that this law will increase propagule pressure and successful invasion events in the megadiverse Amazon River system - threatening aquatic biodiversity. We defend that authorities should propose laws that encourage aquaculture with native species, and take appropriate measures that prioritize the conservation of pristine Amazonian ecosystems.
