Life history characteristics of an invasive cyprinid fish (Carassius gibelio) in Chimaditis Lake (northern Greece)
The life history characteristics of an invasive cyprinid fish, the Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio) were examined in Lake Chimaditis (northern Greece). The population is dominated by females that are able to reproduce gynogenetically. Fish samples were collected using trammel nets from August 2004 to July 2005. Their total length (TL) ranged between 21.9 and 37.0 cm. The length-weight relationship was W = 0.0336TL2.81 (r2 = 0.92, n = 600) and the mean Fulton condition factor exhibited monthly variation from 0.172 (May) to 0.186 (August). According to the annual growth marks present, the lifespan of the Prussian carp in Lake Chimaditis is 6 years. The growth parameters were estimated as L = 34.46 cm, K = 0.297 year-1, t0 = -1.994 year. Absolute fecundity (FA) ranged between 26 000 and 176 600 oocytes (mean = 66990) and relative fecundity between 78 and 251 oocytes per gram of total weight (mean = 158). Absolute fecundity increased exponentially with length (FA = 0.286 x TL3.66, r2 = 0.66) and weight (FA = 17.93 x W1.36, r2 = 0.73) of the fish.
