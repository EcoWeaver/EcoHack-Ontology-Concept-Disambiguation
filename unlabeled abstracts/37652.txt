Aboveground biomass in reforestation with native species established by means of Taungya agroforestry system
ABSTRACT The mitigation of CO2 emission through high-productivity systems associated with restoration of degraded sites have been increasingly common, highlighting the importance of estimates of the amount and distribution of plant biomass in different ecosystems and under different management systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of planting and soil characteristics and the type of management performed over the aboveground biomass accumulation in two reforestation projects with native species, implanted through Taungya agroforestry system. The differences in aboveground biomass accumulation were probably influenced by agroforestry management, since these variations showed to be independent of age (considered within the age range in this study), the spacing, the species composition, and soil fertility. The values of aboveground biomass are similar to those reported in the literature for other reforestation projects with native species of similar ages.
