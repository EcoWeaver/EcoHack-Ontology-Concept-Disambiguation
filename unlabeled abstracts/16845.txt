Inventory of the fish fauna from Ivai River basin, Parana State, Brazil
Abstract We compiled data on fish fauna of the Ivai River basin from recent specialised literature, standardised sampling and records of species deposited in fish collections. There were 118 fish species of eight orders and 29 families. Of these, 100 species are autochthonous (84.8%), 13, allochthonous (11.0%) and five, exotic (4.2%). The main causes for the occurrence of non-native species are escapes from aquaculture, introduction for fishing purposes and the construction of the Itaipu hydroelectric plant. The predominance of small and medium-sized Characiformes and Siluriformes, including 13 species new to science, accounts for approximately 11.0% of all species and 13.0% of all native species. About 10.2% of all species and 12.0% of all native species are endemic to the upper stretch of the Ivai River, isolated by numerous waterfalls in tributary rivers and streams. The Ivai River basin is subjected to various anthropogenic interferences such as pollution, eutrophication, siltation, construction of dams, flood control, fisheries, species introduction and release of fingerlings. These activities raise concerns about biodiversity of Brazilian inland waters especially regarding the fish fauna; the basin of the Ivai River already has species classified in categories of extinction risk: Brycon nattereri and Apareiodon vladii (Vulnerable) and Characidium heirmostigmata and Steindachneridion scriptum (Endangered). The high species richness of native fish, endemism of some, high environmental heterogeneity, high risk of extinction and lack of knowledge of several other species along with the eminent human activities raise the need to enrich the scientific knowledge for future conservation efforts for the studied basin.
