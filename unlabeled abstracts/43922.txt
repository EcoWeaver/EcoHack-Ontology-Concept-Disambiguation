Joint toxic effects of heavy metals and atrazine on invasive plant species Solidago Canadensis L.
In this study, the joint effects of Cd(II), Pb(II) and atrazine (ATR) on Solidago Canadensis L. were investigated. The results showed that soil containing Cd, Pb and ATR could inhibit root elongation of Solidago Canadensis L., and that there was a positive linear relationship between the inhibitory rate of root elongation and the concentrations of Pb(II). The mixture of Cd(II) and Pb(II)-ATR in soil showed a significant adverse effect on root and shoot biomass of Solidago Canadensis L. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) contents increased slightly at the lower concentrations of Cd(II)-ATR, then decreased when Cd(II)-ATR concentrations were higher than those of 1.0 TUmix(Cd+ATR). The toxic effect of Pb(II)-ATR on the ASA contents of Solidago Canadensis L. was greater than that of Cd(II)-ATR. Soluble sugar contents firstly decreased and then increased with increasing concentrations of Cd(II)-ATR and displayed fluctuation with increasing concentrations of Pb(II)-ATR. Total protein contents increased with increasing concentrations of Cd(II) and Pb(II)-ATR, relative to the control sample. The NP-SH contents showed a significant increase up to 12.2 mg/gfw of Cd(II)-ATR, followed by a significant decline to 4.5 mg/gfw after 14 days of exposure. The effect of Pb(II)-ATR was similar to that of Cd(II)-ATR but the amount of NP-SH was not higher than that of Cd(II)-ATR.
