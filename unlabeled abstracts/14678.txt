Effects of Tidewater and Crab Burrowing on H2S Emission and Sulfur Storage inSpartina alternifloraMarsh
ng to uncover the effects of tidewater and crab burrowing on sulfur cycling of Spartina alterniflora marsh, a field experiment was carried out at Jiangsu Yancheng Wetland National Nature Reserve. H2S flux, plant sulfur storage and total sulfur of sediments in S. alterniflora marsh were measured under different tidewater and crab burrows treatments. Results showed that crab burrows significantly increased H2S emission from S. alterniflora marsh, while no significant effect on H2S emission by tidewater was detected. Both tidewater and crab burrows had no significant effects on plant sulfur storage except that the crab burrows significantly decreased it in the seeding season. Tidewater only significantly impacted total sulfur in sediments of 0-30 cm depth, while those in soil of 0-20 and 40-50 cm depths were significantly affected by crab burrows. Total sulfur in sediments affected by tidewater and crab burrows exhibited a seasonal variation. The findings of this study indicated that both tidewater and crab burrowing were key disturbing factors affecting sulfur cycling in S. alterniflora marsh but in different aspects.
