Debarking as a control method for invasive tree species management in tropical forests
Our study assessed the effectiveness of species debarking in controlling species invasion and the change in seedling dynamics after application of the different treatments. A split plots design was used in two forest reserves to assess the effectiveness of three debarking treatments: complete ring debarking, partial ring debarking and a control (no debarking). The results reveal that ring debarking has the potential to be used to control invasive species such as Cecropia peltata L. and Broussonetia papyrifera (L.) Vent. The efficiency, however, was influenced by the extent of the wound created and the size of tree, especially if trees are partially debarked. The control method also stimulated natural regeneration of native species with higher regeneration of native species recorded compared to invasive species. Also, plots that had completely debarked trees had higher species diversity than the partially debarked and the control plots in one of the reserve. The fact that none of the trees in the control plots died is indication of the effectiveness of debarking in the control of invasive species considered here. The effectiveness of this method suggests it is a suitable option for killing small to medium size trees with little cost to the environment compared to the application of arboricides for instance and is therefore worth revisiting in silvicultural treatments where minimum environmental disturbance is required. We recommend more studies to compare the effectiveness of the control approaches on different invasive species and monitor how the native communities respond including in terms of species diversity and functional groups, since removal methods may impact differently on these plant community traits.
