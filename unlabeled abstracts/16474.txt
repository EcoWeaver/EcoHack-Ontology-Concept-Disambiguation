Surviving in the south: a recent incursion of the agile wallaby (Macropus agilis) in Tasmania
The agile wallaby (Macropus agilis) has established in a small area of coastal plain on the central east coast of Tasmania. The Tasmanian occurrence is the only known population of this species outside its natural geographical range. The current wild population is likely to have originated from a small number of individuals that escaped or were released from a nearby wildlife park in the late 1990s. The population is successfully reproducing although it appears to be relatively small and restricted. A precautionary approach is needed and the eradication of the population is recommended.
