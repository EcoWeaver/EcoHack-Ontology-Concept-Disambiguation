Methods for invasive species control are transferable across invaded areas.
Cane Toads (Rhinella marina) are invasive pests in many parts of the world, including the Japanese island of Ishigaki. Extensive research in Australia has identified promising new methods for control, but also has shown that toads exhibit geographic variation in many traits (suggesting that methods developed in one location may not work in another). Can the approaches developed in Australia play a useful role for controlling this invasive species in Japan? Our experimental trials on Ishigaki Island suggest that these new methods can be successfully applied to Japan. First, Cane Toad embryos exposed to chemical cues of conspecific tadpoles exhibited a reduction in viability (subsequent growth and development). This response appears to be species-specific, with native frog embryos not being affected by exposure to cues from toad tadpoles, and Cane Toad embryos not being affected by exposure to cues from native frog tadpoles. Second, Cane Toad tadpoles were attracted to traps containing water from conspecific eggs, and toxin from adult conspecifics. Third, adult Cane Toads were attracted to acoustic cues of calling males, with sex differences in rates of attraction to specific versions of a synthetic call (males were attracted to choruses whereas females were attracted to low-frequency calls). Our results suggest that the methods developed by Australian researchers are applicable to controlling invasive Cane Toads in Japan.
