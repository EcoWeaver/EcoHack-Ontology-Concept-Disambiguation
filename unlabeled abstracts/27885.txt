Invasion by the marine gastropod Ocinebrellus inornatus in France. III. Comparison of biological traits with the resident species Ocenebra erinacea
Invasive species impacts on native species and communities have been widely recognised for decades and may involve important economical losses. In this study, we examined two marine muricid gastropods: an invader, Ocinebrellus inornatus, and a resident, Ocenebra erinacea. Both species co-occur on French Atlantic coasts and probably have economical impacts on oyster farming areas of the Charente-Maritime region of France. In previous studies, we investigated the introduction source and the expansion patterns of O. inornatus, using molecular markers. However, these studies are not sufficient to fully understand the expansion dynamics of the exotics. The present framework is devoted to comparing life-history traits between the introduced and resident species. Our results first showed that O. inornatus has more favourable traits, such as a better mean growth rate and a higher reproductive effort, in comparison with O. erinacea. These traits may explain the invader establishment and, partly, its spread along the coast of France. Secondly, the resident species drilled a higher rate of oysters than the invader. Finally, the establishment of O. inornatus in France does not seem to be at the expense of O. erinacea because: (1) resources are not limiting in oyster farming areas and (2) there does not appear to be competition by interference between the species.
