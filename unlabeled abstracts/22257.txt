Crayfish learning abilities: how does familiarization period affect the capture rate of a new prey item?
This study explores the effect of the length of learning period on capture rate of a previously unfamiliar prey by an invasive freshwater crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). Juvenile crayfish were subjected to different periods of contact (learning period) with a larvae prey (Chaoborus sp.). The length of the learning period significantly affected the number of prey consumed by the predator. Our results indicate that the naive crayfish require less than 12h to learn to maximize capture rate of this prey. The learning coefficient, adopted in the present study, may be useful in exploring predation capabilities of alien species in newly invaded habitats.
