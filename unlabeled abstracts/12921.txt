The invasive caprellid Caprella scaura Templeton, 1836 (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Caprellidae) arrives on Madeira Island, Portugal
A survey to monitor for marine non-indigenous species in two marinas of the Archipelago of Madeira (Portugal) has detected the invasive caprellid Caprella scaura Templeton, 1836 in Madeira Island. This species was first described from Mauritius in the western Indian Ocean. During the 20th century, Caprella scaura has been detected in numerous locations worldwide (Australia, California, Mediterranean) and most recently reported in southern Europe and northern Africa. Hull fouling was the most likely vector for the introduction of C. scaura to Madeira Island.
