The importance of long-term surveys on species introductions in Maritime Antarctica: first detection of Ceratophysella succinea (Collembola: Hypogastruridae)
Biological invasions are one of the major threats to Antarctic native biodiversity and to ecosystems integrity. Regional environmental change and increasing human activity in Maritime Antarctica facilitates the introduction, establishment and colonisation of an increasing number of non-indigenous species. Systematic monitoring is an essential tool for the early detection of the arrival of non-indigenous arthropods. In this study, we compiled the results of a long-term monitoring effort from 2011 to 2017 to survey non-native collembolan species on Deception Island, a highly visited terrestrial site in South Shetland Islands (Maritime Antarctica). Results include the first record of Ceratophysella succinea (Gisin) (Hypogastruridae) in Antarctica. Moreover, the global dataset indicates that the total number and the list of cumulatively occurrence localities for non-native species observed on the island has increased over this monitoring period. This suggests that repeated monitoring is advisable to characterise the full extent of microarthropod introductions into a high biosecurity risk area and improve the effectiveness of surveillance efforts.
