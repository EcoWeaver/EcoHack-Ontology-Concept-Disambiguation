Decapod fauna of the Helgoland trench (Crustacea) a long-term study in a biodiversity hotspot
Thirty-seven species of decapod Crustaceans were collected from the Helgoland Trench during a long-term study through the periods 1982-1992 and 2000-2013. This brings up the decapod species known from that area up to 41 (+ 3 uncertain ones). Most of the species have a boreal to temperate distribution pattern. The diversity and specificity of the fauna are particularly high and amount to about a quarter of the total species numbers of the German Bight. The Helgoland Trench can thus be considered as a biodiversity hotspot in the German Bight. Furthermore, the species composition reacts quite sensibly to temperature changes induced by climate change and alien species remained notably absent.
