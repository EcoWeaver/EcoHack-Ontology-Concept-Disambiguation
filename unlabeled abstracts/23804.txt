Habitat impact on raccoon dogNyctereutes procyonoideshome range size in southern Finland
Monogamous canid home range size is often negatively correlated with population density. Home range size, in turn, may be affected by the habitat. Here we examined landscape features that may affect home range size of the invasive raccoon dogNyctereutes procyonoides (Gray, 1834), an important vector of diseases and parasites in Europe. The aim was thus to reveal the habitats where population density and the risk for epizootics is highest. We radio tracked 42 raccoon dogs in three areas in southern Finland between 2001 and 2007. There was an inverse relationship between home range size and the proportions of meadows and gardens, as well as habitat richness. Also mixed forests were more common in areas where home ranges were small. The risk for epizootics, such as rabies, is thus highest in areas which constitute of a mosaic of small patches of meadows, gardens and mixed forests. The preventive measures, such as bait vaccinations, against epizootics should therefore be concentrated in these areas which are mainly in and around villages.
