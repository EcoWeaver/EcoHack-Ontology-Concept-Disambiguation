Re-evaluating eradication of nuisance species: invasion of the tunicate, Ciona intestinalis
Eradication is an important concept in the management of biological invasions, but it is rarely considered in practice. This may be because managers commonly work with incomplete data and little or no practical guidance. Past eradication frameworks provide some useful criteria, but do not provide quantitative guidelines. Here, we argue that eradication is not always adequately considered, and we develop a framework for rapid assessment of its feasibility, despite limited data. This quantitative model offers criteria to rapidly assess the potential for eradication and provide estimates of the necessary effort and timing, and of the size of the target area. This framework is applied to a recent tunicate (Ciona intestinalis) invasion around Prince Edward Island, Canada, which is causing considerable economic damage to harvesters of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis). Our framework suggests that eradication may be feasible and, based on a cost-benefit analysis, could require only a >= 16% chance of success to constitute a worthwhile risk.
