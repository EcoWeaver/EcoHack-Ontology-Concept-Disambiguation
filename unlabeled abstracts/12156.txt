Why do farmers plant more exotic than native trees? A case study from the Western Ghats, India
Farmers worldwide regularly plant trees to obtain provisioning and other ecosystem services. This practice has come under scrutiny by conservationists who perceive a reduction of biodiversity due to preferential planting of exotic trees. In order to reverse this preference for exotic trees it is necessary to identify the key drivers of exotic species planting and propose alternative species of interest to farmers. We examined this question in a coffee agroforestry landscape of the Western Ghats, India, a global biodiversity hotspot. We interviewed farmers regarding tree planting behaviour, preferences and constraints, and assessed the relative performance and value of native versus exotic species. Multivariate analyses were used with six species-level characteristics and four farm-level characteristics, to reveal the most significant predictors of planting frequency.
