Scale dependent relationships between native plant diversity and the invasion of croftonweed (Eupatorium adenophorum) in southwest China
Croftonweed is an invasive plant in southwest China. We examined the relationships between its invasion patterns and native plant diversity at different spatio-temporal scales. At the 25 m2 scale, invasion success was negatively correlated with native plant diversity, indicating that resource availability might be the dominant factor regulating community invasibility. At the 400-m2 scale, both negative and positive relationships were detected, possibly identifying a spatial scale threshold where extrinsic environmental factors became more important to community invasibility. At the vegetation province scale, variations in physical environment outweighed the importance of intrinsic biotic factors and positive relationships between diversity and invader success were found. Native plant diversity also inhibited croftonweed over the course of community succession and at the early stages of invasion at local spatial scales. However, the changing relationship might be an artifact of sampling at different spatial scales. Nomenclature: Croftonweed, Eupatorium adenophorum Sprengel EUPAD.
