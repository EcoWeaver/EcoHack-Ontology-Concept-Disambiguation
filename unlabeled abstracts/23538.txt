Habitat use of the wild boar,Sus scrofaLinnaeus 1758, in Los Alerces National Park, Argentina
The aim of this work was to study the patterns of habitat use of the wild boar in Los Alerces National Park, Argentina. We surveyed 262 transects, totaling 26.2 km, searching for fresh signs of the species. The wild boar used low elevations more intensively (600 to 700 m asl) than higher elevations, and forests of Nothofagus dombeyi and N. antarctica with understory dominated by Chusquea culeou than other vegetation types. The occurrence of signs among elevation strips and vegetation types was different between summer and autumn. Our results might be helpful for park managers and park rangers in developing wild boar control plans.
