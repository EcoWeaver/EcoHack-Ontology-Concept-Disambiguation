The ecological, economic and public health impacts of nuisance chironomids and their potential as aquatic invaders
This review examines the ecological, economical, and public health significance of chironomids and provides examples of chironomid invasions via international shipping and the subsequent local and regional impacts. Dispersal and adaptation mechanisms as facilitators of chironomid invasions are presented, and control methods are discussed. Impacts ranged from increased nuisance occurrences to agricultural disruption. Anthropogenic activities including pollution-related decimation of aquatic benthic communities might allow introduction of invasive chironomids. Chironomids can inhabit many environments, including eutrophic lakes and wastewater treatment areas, and may accumulate contaminants in high concentrations. Health concerns include the association of chironomid egg masses with Vibrio cholerae, roles of chironomids as vectors for avian botulism, and effects of chironomid chemicals as human allergens. Therefore, the presence of new chironomid species in an environment may present threats to public health and local ecosystems.
