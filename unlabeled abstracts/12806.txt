Estimation of genetic divergence based on mitochondrial DNA variation for an invasive alien species, Metcalfa pruinosa (Say), in Korea
The invasive alien species, Metcalfa pruinosa (Say), has been spreading in Korea since it was first recorded at Gimhae in Gyeongnam province in 2005. This species has caused damage to major forest trees and several agricultural crops both by direct plant sap feeding and by indirectly vectoring sooty mold disease. This study aimed to estimate genetic divergence based on mitochondrial DNA variation in several populations from six countries to determine the origin of the Korean population of M. pruinosa. A total of 23 haplotypes were observed in the analysis of nucleotide polymorphisms on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene in 124 voucher specimens. Among these specimens, only two haplotypes (HAP_1 and HAP_2) were confirmed in the Korean population, which had the lowest diversities of haplotype and nucleotide (0.093 and 0.00032, respectively), whereas populations of North America and Europe exhibited a relatively higher haplotype and nucleotide diversities. Population genetic analyses revealed that the Korean population was closer to European populations than North American populations; it had the lowest FST (0.589, p < 0.001) and exhibited a relatively lower percentage of variation (14.6%, p < 0.001) in the analysis of molecular variance. Taken together, these findings suggested that the Korean population might have originated from European countries, rather than from North America.
