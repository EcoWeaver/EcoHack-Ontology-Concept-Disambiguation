Deep Sequencing Reveals Highly Variable Gut Microbial Composition of Invasive Fish Mossambicus Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) Collected from Two Different Habitats
Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) is one of the most invasive fish found throughout the World and emerged as a major threat to the indigenous fishes in many countries. Investigating the gut microbial diversity of such fishes is one of the ways to understand its physiology. In the present study, we have explored the gut microbial community structure of tilapia using 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the Illumina Miseq platform. Our study showed significant differences in tilapia gut microbiota collected from different habitats (i.e. river and lakes) suggesting the influence of habitat on the gut microbial diversity of tilapia. This study gives a first insight into the mossambicus tilapia gut microbiota and provides a reference for future studies.
