Nonlinearity of effects of invasive ecosystem engineers on abiotic soil properties and soil biota
Invasions of non-indigenous species into natural communities are currently rated as one of the most important threats to biodiversity. Particularly exotic ecosystem engineers such as earthworms potentially have profound impacts on community assembly and functioning. We investigated the impact of invasion by the lumbricid earthworms into an aspen forest of the Canadian Rocky Mountains on soil organic matter, microorganisms and microarthropod communities. Building on the results of previous studies in this forest, we expected positive effects of Lumbricus terrestris middens and negative effects of Octolasion tyrtaeum on soil biota (increase and decrease in soil nutrient concentrations, microbial parameters and soil microarthropod density and diversity, respectively). Further, we expected that earthworm effects change with time.
