Emerging predictable features of replicated biological invasion fronts
Significance Biological dispersal is a key driver of several fundamental processes in nature, crucially controlling the distribution of species and affecting their coexistence. Despite its relevance for important ecological processes, however, the subject suffers an acknowledged lack of experimentation, and current assessments point at inherent limitation to predictability even in the simplest ecological settings. We show, by combining replicated experimentation on the spread of the ciliate Tetrahymena sp. with a theoretical approach based on stochastic differential equations, that information on local unconstrained movement and reproduction of organisms (including demographic stochasticity) allows reliable prediction of both the propagation speed and range of variability of invasion fronts over multiple generations.
