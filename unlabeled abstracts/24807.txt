Influence of calcium, potassium, and magnesium on Cornus florida L. density and resistance to dogwood anthracnose
Dogwood anthracnose, a major disease of Cornus florida L., has caused heavy mortality of C. florida in eastern United States forests. Disease severity and rate of infection have been shown to vary with several environmental factors, but the link between soil cation availability and anthracnose has not been examined. We hypothesized that soil cation availability, particularly calcium (Ca), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg), would influence dogwood survival from anthracnose. In forested stands, positive correlations between soil Ca, K, and Mg saturation and C. florida stem density and basal area were found. The effect of these cations at four levels (0, 50, 100, and 200%) of a standard nursery fertilization rate on C. florida seedling survival and resistance to dogwood anthracnose was tested. Although most of the seedlings died after one season of exposure to dogwood anthracnose, seedlings that had lower inputs of Ca and K cations showed higher levels of disease severity sooner than seedlings in other treatments, suggesting that these nutrients play a role in C. florida survival from anthracnose. Magnesium treatment levels did not appear to have an effect on C. florida disease severity or mortality.
