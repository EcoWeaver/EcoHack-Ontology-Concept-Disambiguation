Coastal wetland mapping combining multi-date SAR and LiDAR
Inventorying and monitoring are imperative to management of vulnerable coastal wetlands. Multi-date and multi-sensor remote sensing offer new capabilities to wetland programmes such as the US National Wetland Inventory. This pilot study focuses on swamp forests and pocosins, marshes, shrub-scrub and invasive Phragmites australis. Combinations of spaceborne multi-date Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) elevation (bare earth elevation and vegetation height) were evaluated. Multi-date SAR data (horizontal-horizontal and horizontal-vertical dual polarizations) highlighted physiognomic dynamics, with LiDAR vegetation canopy discerning selected classes. The highest overall accuracy used SAR, LiDAR canopy and digital elevation model (DEM) data (81% k = 0.744), but not significantly different from the SAR-only classification (81% k = 0.742). Both classifications exceeded the data combination using SAR data and DEM (66% k = 0.521) and SAR data with vegetation canopy (80% k = 0.725). This approach requires investigation using advanced classification algorithms to prove its potential for monitoring wetland change, sea-level rise, and invasive species.
