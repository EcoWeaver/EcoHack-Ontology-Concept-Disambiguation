Productivity of three successive rotations of P. radiata plantations in South Australia over a century
In the southeast of South Australia and the adjacent south west of Victoria (called the Green Triangle Region), planting of Pinus radiata D. Don (radiata pine) plantations began about 130 years ago and these now occupy 175,000 ha. They are growing on sites with generally podsolised sandy soils, low in soil fertility and where evaporation typically exceeds precipitation for five to six months of the year. Regional softwood industries producing a range of value added products are completely dependant on the versatile radiata pine wood from these plantations.
