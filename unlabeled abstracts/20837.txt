Spatial genetic structure of Coccoloba cereifera (Polygonaceae), a critically endangered microendemic species of Brazilian rupestrian fields
Coccoloba cereifera (Polygonaceae) is an extremely rare endemic shrub found exclusively in the rupestrian fields of Serra do Cipo, southeastern, Brazil. We assessed the genetic diversity and structure across the single occurrence area of C. cereifera. The genetic variation at 13 microsatellite loci was estimated from 139 individuals sampled in nine patches. The number of alleles per locus varied from two to ten; the expected and observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.324 to 0.566 and 0.337 to 0.529, respectively. Microsatellites detected low but statistically significant levels of differentiation among patches (F ST = 0.123, R ST = 0.105), whereas Mantel test results showed a weak but significant pattern of isolation by distance (r 2 = 0.31, P < 0.002). Bayesian clustering indicated two subdivisions connected via admixture. Habitat heterogeneity across the drainage basin of the Rio Indequice is likely limiting gene flow within patches of the geographically restricted population. While there is currently no evidence for a direct genetic risk to species survival, the apparent natural segregation occurring within the species could be exacerbated by future land use changes and the influx of alien species which could lead to demographic reductions in population size leading to a reduction in genetic diversity and an increase in population subdivision. We suggest that maintaining the integrity of the habitat within the small range of the species and continued monitoring of the effects of alien species would be the wisest use of management resources.
