Antioxidant Activity and In-vitro Cytotoxicity Study of Novel Dombeya wallichii (An invasive plant) against Human Lung Cancer Cell Line
Recent research is focusing on the search for new types of natural chemotherapeutic agents derived from plants which are proving to be excellent sources of new compounds. The present research article was aimed to study the antioxidant activity of ethanolic extracts of Dombeya wallichii, which is an invasive plant (Plants that do not occur naturally in a region but proliferate in the area they have been introduced into) by DPPH radical scavenging method which exhibited antioxidant activity with IC50 value of 744.04 ug /ml. The cytotoxic activity of ethanolic extracts from the leaves of Dombeya wallichii, by in-vitro cytotoxic assays like MTT against lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line A549 which exhibited anticancer activity with IC50 value of 2.50 ug /ml concentration. This study creates the awareness about this plant which is having potential antioxidant activity, cytotoxic activity and the outcomes propose that D. wallichii as a potential source of alternative medication drugs for treating cancer. Further research is required to find out the effective mechanisms responsible for anticancer properties and for curating the therapeutic benefits of the less explored and exploited invasive species.
