"Sight-unseen" detection of rare aquatic species using environmental DNA
Effective management of rare species, including endangered native species and recently introduced nonindigenous species, requires the detection of populations at low density. For endangered species, detecting the localized distribution makes it possible to identify and protect critical habitat to enhance survival or reproductive success. Similarly, early detection of an incipient invasion by a harmful species increases the feasibility of rapid responses to eradicate the species or contain its spread. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of environmental DNA (eDNA) as a detection tool in freshwater environments. Specifically, we delimit the invasion fronts of two species of Asian carps in Chicago, Illinois, USA area canals and waterways. Quantitative comparisons with traditional fisheries surveillance tools illustrate the greater sensitivity of eDNA and reveal that the risk of invasion to the Laurentian Great Lakes is imminent.
