Altitudinal range shift detected through seedling survival of Ceiba aesculifolia in an area under the influence of an urban heat island
Changes in the position along the elevational gradient for plant species are a predicted consequence of global and local climate change. Within the area of influence of cities it is necessary, for conservation and ecological restoration, to understand the effect on plant communities of climate change and urban heat islands, that can increase the temperature around cities as much as 8degC when compared with peri-urban rural areas. We explored patterns of seedling survival of Ceiba aesculifolia, a tropical tree species, along an altitudinal gradient in a slope facing the city of Morelia, in Michoacan, Mexico, because the city has followed a trend of increasing mean annual temperatures with a difference of at least 4degC when compared with the surrounding rural areas. The highest survival was found between 2200 and 2230m a.s.l. (100% after 1 year of planting and 75% after 2 years), 160m higher than the altitudinal limit of the remnant adult trees in the study area, and close to the highest limit reported for the species at a regional scale (2200m a.s.l.). There was a significant effect of altitude on survival among experimental plots (P
