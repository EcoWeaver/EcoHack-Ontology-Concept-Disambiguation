Occurence of the introduced cichlid Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters) in Queensland
The Mozambique mouthbrooder, O. mossambicus, has established self-maintaining populations in two water-supply reservoirs in Brisbane, south-eastern Queensland, and in ornamental ponds and a man-made drainage system in Townsville, northern Queensland. It has bred in standing freshwater systems and in tidally flushed drains. An attempt to eradicate O. mossambicus from ornamental ponds in Townsville in 1980 was unsuccessful. The species has also been recorded from the Gascoyne River, Carnarvon, Western Australia.
