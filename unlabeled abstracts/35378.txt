Data on FTIR, TGA - DTG, DSC of invasive pennisetum purpureum grass
The aim of this research is to characterize the invasive grass, Pennisetum purpureum, to evaluate the potentiality of the bioenergy production. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra are measured in order to understand the functional groups and their structure in the biomass. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the derivative thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) data are provided under Pyrolysis (N2) and combustion (O2) conditions to reveal the degradation pattern of the biomass. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is the thermochemical process to measure the enthalpy changes pattern of the biomass. The original data presented in this work can be found in a research paper titled "Evaluation of the bioenergy potential of invasive Pennisetum purpureum through pyrolysis and thermogravimetric analysis", by Md Sumon Reza, Shafi Noor Islam, Shammya Afroze, Muhammad S. Abu Bakar, Rahayu S. Sukri, Saidur Rahman, and Abul K. Azad [1].
