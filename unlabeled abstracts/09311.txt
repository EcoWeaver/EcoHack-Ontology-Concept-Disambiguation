Germination of seven exotic weeds and seven native speciesin south-western Australia under steady and fluctuating water supply
The germination of seven common weeds and seven species native to south-western Australia was studied at three sites where they co-occur and in the laboratory. Under field conditions, final germination of the exotic species was much higher than that of the native species, and the number of days to reach 50 % final germination was lower. For some of the germination period, soil moisture was lower than expected after 48 h without rain, with one dry period lasting 10 d. Overall, germination rose with increasing wetness of the three sites, especially among the weeds. Most exotic species germinated under laboratory conditions needed less than 10 d to reach 50 % of final germination which was further delayed by 2 d when seeds were removed from their moist substrate and allowed to dry out (air-drying) for 48 h. Most native species took 10-35 d, with a mean delay of 7 d after 48 h of air-drying. Total germination of the weeds was close to 100 % and was little affected by periods of air-drying. Germination of the native species was more variable and greatly reduced by air-drying in two species. We conclude that water availability as it varies through time and space is significant in controlling germination even during the wet season. The quicker and greater responses of weed seeds to moisture may contribute toward the superior ability of weeds to colonise disturbed habitats. Differences in life form, seed size, flatness, presence of appendages, and ability to absorb or retain water only partially explain these results.
