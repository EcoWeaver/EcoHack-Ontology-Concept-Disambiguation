Review and Key to the World Parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) of Greenideinae Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae), Including Notes on Invasive Pest Species
A review and illustrated key of the aphidiine parasitoids of Greenideinae aphids is presented including their distribution. Fissicaudus thailandicus Star & Rakhshani sp. nov. from Thailand is described and Thgured. Parabioxys songbaiensis Shi & Chen is redescribed based on reared specimens from North Korea. Faunal peculiarities and relationships of the taxa are discussed together with a synopsis of their potential as biocontrol agents. KEY WORDS review, Aphidiinae, Greenideinae, key The oldest fossil representatives of Greenideinae aphids are known from Miocene deposits in southern Europe. Subsequent climatic changes limited their geographic range to southeastern Asia where 130 species are known to occur (Wegierek and Pen alver 2002). Numerous studies dealing with this aphid sub-family have been published (Raychaudhuri et al. Sugimoto 2008). Greenidea Schouteden includes several invasive pest species and the most recent literature of the subfamily Greenideinae deals with members of this genus. Greenidea psidii van der Goot is reported from Bangladesh Sugimoto 2008). Another invasive pest species Greenidea ficicola (Takahashi) is reported from Australia, reported to infest plants belonging to the Moraceae and Myrtaceae (Noordam 1994, Blackman and Eastop 2000, Halbert 2004). Accord-ing to Halbert (2004) G. psidii and G. ficicola have been classiThed as having the potential to become pests of certain ornamental plants in Florida. The present contribution summarizes informa-tion on the parasitoids of Greenideinae as an aid to taxonomic, biological, and biodiversity research studies. It is our hope that the information herein will facilitate the selection of parasitoids for bio-logical control.
