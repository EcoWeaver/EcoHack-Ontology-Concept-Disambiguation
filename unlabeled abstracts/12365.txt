Studies in the genusPaspalum(Paniceae, Poaceae) in Europe: 3.Paspalum thunbergii, a new naturalized neophyte in W Europe
Paspalum thunbergii, a weedy species native to E Asia, is reported for the first time from W Europe. In Italy a naturalized population was detected in 2014 in a heathland in Boscaccio (Lentate sul Seveso; Monza and Brianza province, Lombardia region). A subsequent revision of local herbaria revealed the existence of a second population, also in Lombardia, discovered in Mortara (Pavia province) in 2011 and now confirmed. The taxonomy and nomenclature of this species are briefly discussed, as are its ecology and habitat preferences. An original line drawing and photographs of the species and its habitat are provided. An updated identification key for the species of Paspalum in Europe is also presented. Citation: Verloove F., Brusa G. & Ardenghi N. M.
