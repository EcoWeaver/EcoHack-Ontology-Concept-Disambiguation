The Potential of Local Farming on the Navajo Nation to Improve Fruit and Vegetable Intake: Barriers and Opportunities
American Indian populations have low produce intake compared to other ethnic groups and higher rates of diet-related chronic diseases. Programs linking farmers to their community (Farm-to-Table) are an innovative way to alter the food environment. We interviewed Navajo farmers (n = 20), storeowners (n = 7), and non-governmental organization representatives (n = 4) to better understand local farming practices and the potential of a Farm-to-Table program to increase produce intake. Barriers to participation in a Farm-to-Table program included lack of water, insufficient help, and exotic species. Participants expressed concern about high obesity rates and voiced support for a Farm-to-Table program if barriers could be adequately addressed.
