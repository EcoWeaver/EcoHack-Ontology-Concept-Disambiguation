The role of aggression in range expansion and biological invasions
Abstract Traits that aid in the invasion process should exhibit a gradient across the expansion range in response to changing selection pressures. Aggression has been repeatedly associated with invasion success in many taxa, as it may help invaders to wrestle the resources from other species which enhances their success in a novel environment. However, aggression primarily allows individuals to overcome conspecific rivals, providing advantages in competition over resources. Agonistic prowess could therefore increase fitness at both ends of the expansion gradient. Here we review the role of aggression in range expansion of invasive species, and its potential role as a driver of range expansion. We analyze how these different mechanisms could affect trait variation in expanding and invasive populations. Specifically, we look at how aggression could help dilate the edges of a population through niche competition, as well as lead to exclusion from the center (i.e. areas of high population density) by the conspe-cifics. Both of these processes will result in a characteristic spatial distribution of phenotypes related to aggression that could provide insights into the ecological pressures and dynamics of expanding populations, potentially providing clues to their success as niche competitors and invasive species.
