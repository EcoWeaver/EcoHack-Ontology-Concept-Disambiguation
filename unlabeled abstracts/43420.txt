Population genomics of Sitka black-tailed deer supports invasive species management and ecological restoration on islands
Invasive mammals represent a critical threat to island biodiversity; eradications can result in ecological restoration yet may fail in the absence of key population parameters. Over-browsing by invasive Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) is causing severe ecological and cultural impacts across the Haida Gwaii archipelago (Canada). Previous eradication attempts demonstrate forest regeneration upon deer removal, but reinvasion reverses conservation gains. Here we use restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (12,947 SNPs) to investigate connectivity and gene flow of invasive deer (n = 181) across 15 islands, revealing little structure throughout Haida Gwaii and identifying the large, central island of Moresby (>2600 km2) as the greatest source of migrants. As a result, the archipelago itself should be considered the primary eradication unit, with the exception of geographically isolated islands like SGang Gwaay. Thus, limiting eradications to isolated islands combined with controlled culling and enhanced biosecurity may be the most effective strategies for achieving ecological restoration goals. Genomic data presented in this study provide clues about why previous attempts to eradicate the invasive Sitka black-tailed deer from the Haida Gwaii archipelago in Canada have been incomplete. The authors find substantial gene flow between islands, with the exception of the remote island of SGang Gwaay, which they argue is a viable option for near-term eradication efforts.
