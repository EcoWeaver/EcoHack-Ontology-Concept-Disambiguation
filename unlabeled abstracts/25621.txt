Modelling biological invasions over homogeneous and inhomogeneous landscapes using level set methods
The establishment, spread and subsequent degradation of existing environments by invasive species is a worldwide problem affecting native and agricultural ecosystems. The phenomenal cost to governments as a result of research and eradication or control drives the need to understand invasion characteristics. In this paper we develop a method for modelling the boundary of an invasion over time with model inputs being the initial distribution of the invasion and the speed at which the invasion front moves over time. This speed function can depend on the topography of the ground cover and we consider examples of homogeneous and inhomogeneous spread. The possibility of a long-distance dispersal event occurring is also considered. In particular, examples of the spread of emergent weeds and weeds which favour creeks and river beds in New Zealand are presented.
