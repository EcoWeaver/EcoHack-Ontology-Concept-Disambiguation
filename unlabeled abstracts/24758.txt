Population dynamics, phenology, and overwintering of Bactrocera dorsalis (Diptera: Tephritidae) in Hubei Province, China
Since 2004 the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) has become widespread and economically important in Wuhan, Hubei Province, central China. In this article, the population dynamics of B. dorsalis were monitored using methyl eugenol-baited traps during 2008-2009 in Wuhan. Adults were captured from early July to the end of December in a citrus orchard and peaked in October and early November. Adult population peak coincided with the ripeness period of sweet oranges in October. Infestation with B. dorsalis was more serious in 2009 than in 2008. Field surveys of host plants for this fly species combined with rearing experiments indicated that pear was the first host plant infested by B. dorsalis. We recorded the following host shift pattern: pear (Pyrus communis L.), jujube (Zizyphus jujuba L.), persimmon (Diospyros kaki L.), and sweet orange (Citrus unshiu Marcor). Our findings suggest that B. dorsalis completes four to five generations per year in this area and most serious damage occurred in the 4th generation in the citrus orchards. The availability of preferred host fruits and the low winter temperature are key factors influencing population fluctuations. Overwintering potential experiments of adults, larvae, and pupae were also carried out in the field. Results suggest that a small proportion of pupae were able to survive winter in Wuhan and emerged successfully the following year. Practical and theoretical implications of the results regarding the invasion potential and management strategy of B. dorsalis in Hubei Province are discussed.
