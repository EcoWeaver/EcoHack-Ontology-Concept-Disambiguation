Leaf litter decomposition and its drivers differ between an invasive and a native plant: Management implications
Litter decomposition is a key process of the carbon cycle in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The dominant conceptual model of litter decomposition assumes that environmental conditions, litter traits, and decomposer composition control litter decomposition in a decreasing order, yet whether this hierarchical model applies to both invasive and native plant species is unknown. Here, by comparing a widespread invasive plant and its native counterpart in Chinese coastal saltmarshes, we aimed to examine whether the hierarchy of factors controlling litter decomposition varies with plant species in the face of plant invasions. Leaf litter of invasive Spartina alterniflora and native Phragmites australis was collected across an 18deg latitudinal range to capture wide variation in litter traits. These leaf litter samples were transported to three saltmarsh sites of different latitudes and were incubated in litterbags varying in mesh size (0.1, 2, and 5 mm) to manipulate decomposer composition. After 90-day incubation, we found a parallel latitudinal pattern in leaf litter decomposition rate (k) between S. alterniflora and P. australis regardless of saltmarsh site and mesh size. Nonetheless, the k value of S. alterniflora was 2.2-fold higher than that of P. australis. Moreover, there was a shift in the hierarchy of factors controlling k values between S. alterniflora and P. australis: environmental conditions (climate and soil) dominated other factors in P. australis, while litter traits contributed more than environmental conditions in S. alterniflora. Overall, our findings show that leaf litter decomposition and its dominant controlling factors across broad geographical ranges can vary with plant invasions, having important implications for managing invasive plants in the context of conserving coastal blue carbon.
