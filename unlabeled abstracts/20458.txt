Competitive interactions during basking between native and invasive freshwater turtle species
The red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) is currently introduced in many Mediterranean countries, where it behaves as an invasive species that competes and displaces native populations of the endangered Spanish terrapin (Mauremys leprosa). However, the nature of competitive interactions is relatively unknown. During basking activity, factors like greater body size or pre-existing behavioral adaptations to an original habitat with higher levels of interspecific competition might confer competitive advantages to introduced T. scripta with respect to native terrapins. We hypothesized that competition for basking places with the introduced T. scripta might negatively affect the efficiency of basking and thermoregulation of the native Spanish terrapin. We experimentally analyzed the basking activity of T. scripta and M. leprosa under occasional and long-term situations of intra- and inter-specific competition. Native M. leprosa subjected to interspecific competition reduced their basking activity, basked for shorter periods than T. scripta, and avoided basking stacked with the exotic turtles. These results suggested the displacement from the basking sites of the native terrapin by the introduced T. scripta. The decreased basking activity of native M. leprosa when competing directly for basking places with introduced sliders may lead native terrapins to a loss in the efficiency of physiological functions related to ineffective thermoregulation, such as digestion or locomotor performance, thus favoring the expansion of the invasive species.
