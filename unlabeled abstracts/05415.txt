Shell Biofilm Nitrification and Gut Denitrification Contribute to Emission of Nitrous Oxide by the Invasive Freshwater Mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Zebra Mussel)
ABSTRACT Nitrification in shell biofilms and denitrification in the gut of the animal accounted for N 2 O emission by Dreissena polymorpha (Bivalvia), as shown by gas chromatography and gene expression analysis. The mussel's ammonium excretion was sufficient to sustain N 2 O production and thus potentially uncouples invertebrate N 2 O production from environmental N concentrations.
