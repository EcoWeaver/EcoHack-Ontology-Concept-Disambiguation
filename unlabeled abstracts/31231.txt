Physical factors affecting the relative abundance of native and invasive amphipods in the St. Lawrence River
The Ponto-Caspian amphipod Echinogammarus ischnus (Stebbing, 1899) is reportedly replacing the North American amphipod Gammarus fasciatus Say, 1818, in the lower Great Lakes, but the two species appear to coexist in the upper St. Lawrence River several years after invasion by E. ischnus. A multi-site survey in the river between Lake Ontario and Montreal (Quebec) found that E. ischnus and G. fasciatus respond differently to substrate characteristics, water chemistry variables, and current velocity. Both species increase in abundance in the presence of dreissenid mussels. However, E. ischnus density is positively correlated with current velocity and an increasing proportion of gravel-sized sediment, while G. fasciatus density is positively correlated with benthic filamentous algal (Cladophora spp.) biomass, macrophyte biomass, and pH. Habitat heterogeneity within the river may be promoting the coexistence of native and exotic amphipods by allowing them to segregate along physicochemical gradients.
