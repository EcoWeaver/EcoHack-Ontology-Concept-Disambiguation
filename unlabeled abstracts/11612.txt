Predation on the invasive red lionfish, Pterois volitans (Pisces: Scorpaenidae), by native groupers in the Bahamas
Springer-Verlag 2008 On 26 January 2008, a tiger grouper, Mycteroperca tigris (472-mm standard length [SL]), was caught off New Provi-dence (25deg04.6C/C/N, 77deg20.6C/C/W), Bahamas and found to contain a single red lionfish, Pterois volitans (61-mm SL) in its stomach. This observation was considered an anomaly given both the venomous nature of lionfish, and their relatively recent introduction to the Bahamas (Snyder and Burgess 2007). Anecdotal evidence provided by fishers, however, suggested that native grouper species were preying on red lionfish with some regularity. Subsequently, five Nassau groupers, Epinephelus striatus, caught off Eleuthera Island (25deg10.0C/C/N, 76deg14.0C/C/W) at an approximate depth of 14 m on 5 March 2008, were dissected. Two of the stomachs contained red lionfish. The first grouper (477-mm SL) contained a partially digested lionfish, identifiable only by the morphology and multiplicity of the remaining fin rays. The second slightly larger grouper (482-mm SL) contained a red lionfish of 137-mm SL which was in almost pristine condition (Fig. 1). The successful invasion and establishment of the piscivorous red lionfish in western Atlantic waters (Fig. 2) (Whitfield et al. 2002; Snyder and Burgess 2007) have lead to concerns over its potential impact on native fish biotas. To our knowledge, this is the first documented evidence of introduced red lionfish being preyed upon by native species within their novel range. Acknowledgments We thank Marco Fox and Johran
