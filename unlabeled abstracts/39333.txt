Review of the biology and ecology of a ragweed leaf beetle, Ophraella communa (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), which is a biological control agent of an invasive common ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia (Asterales: Asteraceae)
A ragweed leaf beetle, Ophraella communa (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), has been highlighted as a potential biological control agent of Ambrosia artemisiifolia. O. communa and A. artemisiifolia are native in North America and alien species in East Asia and Europe. As an invasive weed, A. artemisiifolia causes severe economic losses as reducing agricultural production as well as producing severe allergenic pollen. As an herbivore insect, O. communa has strong host preference on A. artemisiifolia. All the developmental stages of O. communa can be found on A. artemisiifolia and it attacks a single plant in repeated and extended manners. With few individuals on A. artemisiifolia, O. communa can completely defoliate before pollen production. Therefore, O. communa had been focused as a biological control of this invasive weed, but its introduction was denied because of possible damage on an important crop, Helianthus annuus. O. communa was accidentally introduced in East Asia and Europe in 1990s and 2010s, respectively. Fortunately, O. communa population was well established to suppress A. artemisiifolia in the introduced areas. Following detailed field surveys and host specificity tests of O. communa were conducted and proved a strong potential of O. communa as a biological control agent of A. artemisiifolia. Moreover, O. communa has been investigated in physiological and evolutionary studies. In this study, the potential of O. communa as a biological control agent and a study organism are reviewed.
