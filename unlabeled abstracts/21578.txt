Recent expansion of the oriental shrimp Palaemon macrodactylus (Crustacea: Decapoda) on the western coasts of France
The invasive oriental shrimp Palaemon macrodactylus Rathbun, 1902 has considerably extended its distribution in transitional waters along the Atlantic and Channel coasts of France during the period 2007-2010. The most probable method of a primary introduction of this species is ballast waters, but passive transport by water currents is also a possible mechanism of colonization (secondary introductions). Palaemon macrodactylus is a powerful invader of transitional waters and these new populations should be monitored in the future to assess any consequences to native species.
