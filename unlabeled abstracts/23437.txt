Native oak retention as a key factor for the conservation of winter bird diversity in managed deciduous forests in northern Italy
Birds can serve as useful model organisms to investigate community level consequences of forestry practices. In this study we investigated the relationships between wintering bird communities and habitat and landscape characteristics of lowland managed forests in Northern Italy. This area is characterized by the spread of the black locust, an alien species that has been favored by forestry practices at the expense of natural oak forests. Birds were censused in winter by point counts in randomly selected plots of 50 m radius. We first addressed bird community-habitat relationships by means of habitat structure measurements, then we investigated bird community-landscape relationships by using GIS techniques. We used generalized linear models (GLM) to test for the effects of habitat and landscape variables on bird community parameters (namely bird species richness, diversity and abundance). Bird community parameters were influenced by oak biomass and tree age, and by oak area and core area, while the other forest habitat types showed less influence. In forest management terms, the main conclusion is that the retention of native oaks is the keyfactor for the conservation of winter bird diversity in local deciduous woods. At the habitat level black locust harvesting may be tolerated, provided that old, large, native oaks are retained in all local woodlots to preserve landscape connectivity and foraging resources. At the landscape meso-scale, large native oak patches, should be preserved or, where necessary, restored.
