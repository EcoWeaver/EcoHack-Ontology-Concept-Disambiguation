Distribution and abundance of Chubut Steamerducks: an endemic species to Central Patagonia, Argentina
We documented the breeding distribution and estimated abundance of Chubut Steamerducks Tachyres leucocephalus, a flightless waterbird endemic to a relatively small section of coastline in Patagonia, Argentina. The distribution of Chubut Steamerducks is restricted to approximately 700 km of coast. We counted 1,703 adult steamerducks at a subset of shorelines within their range and estimated 1,841 adults after correcting for visibility for shore-based surveys. To estimate adult densities in unsurveyed areas, we used two different methods of extrapolation, resulting in estimates of 1,587 and 1,832 adults. Combined with numbers from surveyed shorelines, the total breeding population size is estimated to be between 3,428 and 3,673 adults. In addition, we counted 1,899 juvenile steamerducks, which occur in irregular aggregations. The Interjurisdictional Marine Park in San Jorge Gulf contains about 46% of the entire population, which may provide some protection from disturbance and habitat destruction. However, oil pollution, other anthropogenic activities, and invasive species still pose potential threats to the population.
