Using Transformative Learning Theory to Explore the Mechanisms of Citizen Participation for Environmental Education on the Removal of Invasive Species: The Case of Green Island, Taiwan
The purpose of this study is to investigate the process of participation in the transformative learning process for invasive species by community volunteers and voluntourists. The results show that children play an important role in motivating adults to accept new ideas, and for both community volunteers and voluntourists, "dialogue" has an important influence on the relationship between self-reflection and new roles. In addition, during the operation of volunteer tourism, the platform provided by local intermediary organizations functioned to link stakeholders in volunteer tourism and promote transformative learning.
