Diet composition of the invasive red-whiskered bulbul Pycnonotus jocosus in Mauritius
Key Words: introduced species, invasional meltdown, oceanic island, plant-animal interaction, positive interaction, seed dispersal Disruption of ecosystems is one of the biggest threats posed by invasive species (Mack et al. 2000). Thus, one of the most important challenges is to understand the impact of exotic species on native species and habitats (e.g. Jones 2008). The probability that entire 'invasive communities' will develop increases as more species establish in new areas (Bourgeois et al. 2005). For example, introduced species may act in concert, facilitating one another's invasion, and increasing the likelihood of successful establishment, spread and impact. Simberloff & Von Holle (1999) introduced the term 'invasional meltdown' for this process, which has received widespread attention since (e.g. O'Dowd 2003, Richardson et al. 2000, Simberloff 2006). Positive interactions among introduced species are relatively common, but few have been studied in detail (Traveset & Richardson 2006). Examples include introduced insects and birds that pollinate and disperse exotic plants, thereby facilitating the spread of these species into non-invaded habitats (Goulson 2003, Mandon-Dalger et al. 2004, Simberloff & Von Holle 1999). From a more general ecological perspective, the study of interactions involving introduced and invasive species can contribute to our knowledge of ecological processes - for example, community assembly and indirect interactions. The red-whiskered bulbul Pycnonotus jocosus L., native to southern Asia, was introduced to the island of Mauritius in the late 1800s (Cheke 1987). Since then, the species
