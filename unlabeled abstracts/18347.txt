Development and characterization of microsatellite loci from Metcalfa pruinosa (Hemiptera: Flatidae)
Metcalfa pruinosa (Say) has damaged many deciduous forest trees, ornamental trees and agricultural crops in Korea as a serious invasive alien species since 2005. It is necessary to estimate the population genetic structure and diversity for confirming the origin and invasion route to prevent successive invasions. Here, we developed and characterized eight microsatellite loci to facilitate a population genetics study of M. pruinosa. The isolated loci were polymorphic with 6-14 alleles in 40 individuals from four regional populations in Korea. The analyses revealed that they had different multilocus genotypes with the expected heterozygosity (H E) ranging from 0.491 to 0.817. Six of the eight loci did not significantly deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The isolated markers will be useful to trace the origin and invasion route of this invasive alien species in the future.
