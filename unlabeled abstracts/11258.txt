Genotypic comparisons of chromosomes 01, 04, and 18 from three tetraploid species of Gossypium in topcrosses with five elite cultivars of G. hirsutum L
Upland cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. is the most widely planted cultivated cotton in the United States and the world. The other cultivated tetraploid species G. barbadense L. is planted on considerable less area; however, it produces extra long, strong, and fine fibers which spins into superior yarn. The wild cotton tetraploid species G. tomentosum Nuttall ex Seemann, native to the Hawaiian Archipelago also exhibits traits, such as drought tolerance, that would also be desirable to transfer to Upland cotton. Long-term breeding efforts using whole genome crosses between Upland and these species have not been successful in transferring very many desirable alleles into Upland cotton. Our chromosome substitution lines (CSL) have one chromosome or chromosome arm from an alien species backcrossed into the Upland cotton line,TM-1, via aneuploid technology. Five Upland cultivars were crossed with CS-B01, CS-T01, CS-B04, CS-T04, CS-B18 and CS-T18 and TM-1 the recurrent parent of the CSLs. This provided an opportunity to determine the effects of chromosomes 01, 04, and 18 from the three species in crosses with the five cultivars. Predicted genotypic mean effects of the parents, F2, and F3 generations for eight agronomic and fiber traits of importance were compared. The predicted hybrid mean effects for the three chromosomes from each species were different for several of the traits across cultivars. There was no single chromosome or species that was superior for all traits in crosses. Parental and hybrid lines often differed in the effect of a particular chromosome among the three species. The predicted genotypic mean effects for F2 and F3, with a few exceptions, generally agree with our previous results for additive and dominance genetic effects of these CSL.
