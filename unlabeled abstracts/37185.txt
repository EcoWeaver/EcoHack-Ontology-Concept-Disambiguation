Metamorphosis of Freshwater Mussel Glochidia (Bivalvia: Unionidae) on Amphibians and Exotic Fishes
This study determined that inexpensive and easily maintained amphibians and exotic fishes could act as hosts for two species of native North American unionid mussels, and bypass the need to identify native hosts when the object is to culture mussels. Two mussel species, Lampsilis cardium and Utterbackia imbecillis, were used to parasitize 42 exotic fishes and seven potential nonpiscine host species. Nonpiscine hosts included amphibians and decapod crustaceans. Lampsilis cardium successfully metamorphosed on six species of exotic fishes, as well as on larval tiger salamanders. Utterbackia imbecillis successfully metamorphosed on 30 species of exotic fishes and all four amphibian species tested. No glochidia metamorphosed on crustaceans. Successful metamorphosis on amphibians indicates that mussel zoogeography may be more complicated than previously thought. Using surrogate hosts may be a valuable alternative to natural hosts in laboratory culture of mussels.
