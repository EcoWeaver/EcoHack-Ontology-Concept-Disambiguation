The relationship between an introduced predator-prey pair, largemouth bass and bluegill, and the chlorophyll concentration in farm ponds
An empirical study was conducted on the effects of an introduced predator-prey pair, largemouth bass and bluegill, on pelagic productivity in 22 ponds in central Japan. In the univariate analysis, the effect of fish invasion on chlorophyll concentration was not evident, primarily because this effect was screened by the positive and negative effects of phosphorus availability and the pond area, respectively. A positive effect on chlorophyll concentration was detected in the best statistical model using nutrient availability and pond area as independent factors. Fish invasion decreased the relative biomass of crustaceans to rotifers. This study showed that the invasion of these exotic fishes affected the pelagic community in the pond.
