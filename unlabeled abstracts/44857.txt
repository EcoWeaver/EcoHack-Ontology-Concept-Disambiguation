Global economic costs and knowledge gaps of invasive gastropods
Invasive alien gastropods are a particularly pervasive taxonomic group worldwide, often causing substantial impacts on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, much remains unknown about this invasive group's economic costs to human society. Here, we used the InvaCost database to evaluate the taxonomic, spatial, and temporal patterns of economic costs associated with invasive gastropods on the global scale. In total, 13 species of invasive gastropods caused a cumulative global cost of US$ 3.94 billion over the period 1966-2020, with a majority being attributed to aquatic species ($ 3.72 billion, 94.4 %, concentrated mostly in Asia) and only $ 0.22 billion (5.6 %, concentrated mostly in Europe) to terrestrial species. Among different regions, Asia (3.71 billion) reported the greatest costs, compared to far lower costs reported in Europe (214.50 million), North America (13.80 million), Oceania (2.69 million), South America (
