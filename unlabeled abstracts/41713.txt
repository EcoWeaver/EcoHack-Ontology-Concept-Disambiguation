Characterizing Pathways of Invasive Plant Spread to Alaska: I. Propagules from Container-Grown Ornamentals
AbstractTo determine the extent and nature of container-grown plant soil as a pathway for introduction of exotic plant species to Alaska, soil from container-grown ornamentals was obtained from vendors and was incubated in the greenhouse. Fifty-four plant species were identified growing in containers or germinating from the soil, and included Canada thistle--a prohibited weed in Alaska--and nine other species listed as invasive in Alaska. The number of species and estimated seed bank were very low for soil from vegetable starts/herbs and herbaceous bedding plants (< 2 seedlings/L soil), but was greater for soil from containers containing woody plants, especially balled and burlapped ornamentals (20 seedlings/L soil). Container alien plant seed bank size was strongly related to type of soil. Potting (soil-less) soil contained 1.2 germinating seeds/L, soil-based soil 5.5 seeds/L, and mineral soil 18.7 seeds/L. Growers and vendors were variables that also influenced the size of the container seed bank, suggesting that weed management practiced during production and at the point of sale can greatly influence seed banks of ornamental containers.
