Development and characterization of 12 microsatellite loci from the blueberry gall midge Dasineura oxycoccana (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae)
The blueberry gall midge, Dasineura oxycoccana (Johnson), is a serious insect pest of blueberries and cranberries in North America. In this study, we developed 12 novel microsatellite loci for this gall midge. To obtain its sequence data, next-generation sequencing was performed using mixed individuals collected from Korea and the USA. The developed loci were polymorphic, with four to nine alleles in 20 individuals from a single population of New Jersey, USA. The analyses revealed that all 20 individuals had different multilocus genotypes with expected heterozygosity ranging from 0.708 to 0.920. In addition, we confirmed the discriminative resolution of all individuals collected. These markers will facilitate future studies on the genetic structure of blueberry gall midge populations.
