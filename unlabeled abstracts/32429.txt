The impact of the invasive species Vespa velutina on honeybees: A new approach based on oxidative stress
Honeybees have an essential role in ecosystems pollinating wild flowers and cultivated crops,representingan important cultural and economic benefit for humans. Honeybee populations are decreasing over the last decade, due to multifactorial causes. The aim of this field study was to investigate the effects of the presence of the invasive species Vespa velutina, a bee predator, in oxidative stress parameters of honeybee workers.To achieve this objective, positive or negative apiaries for the presence of the V. velutinawere selected. Five honeybees from six hives of each apiary were sampled in spring, summer and autumn, analysing a total of 233 samples. Analysis of mRNA expression of oxidative stress-related genes, catalase enzymatic activity and lipid peroxidation were performed. An increase in sod2, tpx3, trxR1, gtpx1, gstS1, coxI, cytC and if2mtgenes expression, as well as a raise in catalase activity and lipid peroxidation were observed in V. velutinapositive samples. Thus, here we present a new methodology to analyse the impact of the predation pressure of the invasive species V. velutinaon honeybeesunder field conditions.In conclusion, the results obtained in this study indicate the negative impact of the presence of the yellow-legged hornet on honeybees'healthand the activation of their antioxidant system to protect them against this biotic stressor. Moreover, the redox status they present could increase thesusceptibilityof honeybees,essential insects that currently receive many inputs of different stresses,to another stressor.
