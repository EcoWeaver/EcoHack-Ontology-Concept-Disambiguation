Biological Invasion of Medically Important Bladder Snail Physella acuta Draparnaud, 1805 (Gastropoda, Physidae) in the Freshwater Habitat of Kerala, India
The globally invasive acute bladder snail Physella acuta is recorded for the first time from southern India with its mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequence for the first time from India. They are host to many trematodes causing foodborne diseases in humans. The snail found attached to invasive freshwater plant Ceratophyllum demersum and other gastropod species Indoplanorbis exustus and Racesina luteola. The density of P. acuta was recorded as 25 +- 10 individuals per 50 cm long shoot. The shell length of the snail ranged between 3.2-7 mm, shell width 2-4 mm, aperture length 2.4-5.2 mm, aperture width 1-2 mm, and spire height 0.9-1.8 mm. The dead vacant shell has brownish yellow colour while live individuals are translucent with a golden yellowish colour. The nucleotide BLAST results showed 100% similarity with the P. acuta sequences reported from Iraq. The specimen also showed a close match with the mtDNA COI sequence from Singapore, Thailand, Southeast Europe, France, Chile and the United States. The introduction of the snail to India is mainly through the aquarium trade. Their rapid growth rate, high reproduction rate, air-breathing capabilities and pollution tolerance make them a potential competitor of native fauna.
