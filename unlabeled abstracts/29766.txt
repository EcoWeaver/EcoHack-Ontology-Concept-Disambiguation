Forest canopy, a proxi of light intensity, arrests Pinus radiata invasion: basic science to conserve the Coastal Maulino forest, Central Chile
Coastal Maulino forest is an endemic forest of central Chile, which has suffered a large history of disturbance, being replaced by large extensions of Pinus radiata plantations. This land transformation conveys high rates of pines invasion into native remnants. In this study we examined to what extent structural features of forest patches explains invisibility of this forest-type. Within eight forest fragments, we sampled 162 plots (10 x 10 m2 each). We quantified seedling pine density and related this estimates with tree cover, litter depth, PAR radiation, and diversity of the resident community. Our results indicate that canopy cover was the most important variable to determine seedling pine density within forest fragments. To preserve the Coastal Maulino forest and the biodiversity containing on it, it seems to be necessary to maintain the native canopy cover. These actions can be highly effective even if we cannot avoid a massive seed arrival from pine plantations which will be unable to regenerate under well conserved native forests.
