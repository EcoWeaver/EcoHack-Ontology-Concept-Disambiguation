Does rainbow trout justify its high rank among alien invasive species? Insights from a nationwide survey in Greece
1. Rainbow trout is ranked as one of the world's worst alien invasive species; in Europe however the extent of established populations remains localized and poorly reported. This study aims to assess rainbow trout establishment in Greece and explores the factors of establishment success or failure. 2. We analyzed fish samples and site specific environmental attributes collected during the past 18 years (2001-2017). We reviewed all available literature on rainbow trout distributional patterns in parallel to those of the Greek native Salmo trout species and applied demographic criteria to infer potential establishment. 3. Poor persistence of populations and population structure data support the argument that recruitment of rainbow trout is extremely limited in Greece. Lack of suitable environmental conditions is not the main factor of rainbow trout's establishment failure. Genetic factors affecting the reproductive process, possibly through a combination of outbreeding depression resulting from the admixture of unrelated intraspecific lineages and maladaptive behaviours resulting from domestication selection acting in captivity, remain probable causes of poor establishment for the Greek populations of rainbow trout. 4. Overall, the threat of rainbow trout as a highly invasive species in Greece is lower than suggested by recent risk assessments.
