Insect pollinators of the invasive plant, Rosa multiflora (Rosaceae), in Iowa, USA
Invasive species often require mutualistic relationships to successfully invade new environments. Insect pollination is an example of a mutualism that is required for seed-set in the invasive species, Rosa multiflora Thunb. (Rosaceae), an obligate outcrosser. To determine the insect pollinators visiting R. multiflora flowers in Iowa, USA, we collected insects on yellow sticky traps placed on plants during the period of blooming and visually observed insects visiting the flowers. The common insect orders that were collected on the sticky traps included Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Mecoptera, and Thysanoptera. Many of the insects found on the sticky cards were known to feed on pollen. However, we did not collect Apidae (bumble bees and honey bees) on the sticky cards. We observed Bombus spp. and Apis mellifera foraging on the flowers. Syrphid flies were the most commonly observed taxa visiting the flowers. Our results indicate that R. multiflora is utilizing common generalist insect pollinators in Iowa and that pollination is not a limiting factor for this invasive species.
