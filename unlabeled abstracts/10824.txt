Hybridization affects life-history traits and host specificity in Diorhabda spp
Hybridization is an influential evolutionary process that has been viewed alternatively as an evolutionary dead-end or as an important creative evolutionary force. In colonizing species, such as introduced biological control agents, hybridization can negate the effects of bottlenecks and genetic drift through increasing genetic variation. Such changes could be beneficial to a biological control program by increasing the chances of establishment success. However, hybridization can also lead to the emergence of transgressive phenotypes that could alter host specificity; an important consideration when assessing potential non-target impacts of planned agents. In a series of lab experiments, we investigated the effects of hybridization between three species of Diorhabda released to control invasive Tamarix (saltcedar) on life history traits through two generations, and through the third generation for one cross. Depending on the cross, hybridization had either a positive or neutral impact on development time, adult mass, and fecundity. We evaluated preference for the target (saltcedar) relative to a non-target host Tamarixaphylla (athel), and found host specificity patterns varied in two of the three hybrids, demonstrating the possibility for hybridization to alter host preference. Importantly, the overall effects of hybridization were inconsistent by cross, leading to unpredictability in the outcome of using hybrids in biological control.
