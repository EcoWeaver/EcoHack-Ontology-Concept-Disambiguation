Competition, legacy, and priority and the success of three invasive species
Competitive ability, the ability to generate legacy effects, and the potential to benefit from priority, individually or interactively, are traits that may increase the invasive potential of plants. In this project we examine these three traits in three invasive species (Agropyron cristatum, Bromus tectorum, and Taeniatherum caput-medusae). Specifically in this study, we examine competitive effects of these invasive species, the ability of these invasive species to generate legacy effects (as plant-soil feedback), and the potential of these three species benefit from priority (being sown concurrently, 30 days before, and 30 days after the restoration species) in a greenhouse study using field collected soil. Our results suggest that all three invasive species can benefit from priority and all three have high competitive ability. However, only A. cristatum benefited from legacy effects of plant-soil feedback.
