Andropogon gayanus Kunth invasion in the Cerrado: from seed production to seedling establishment along roadsides
Andropogon gayanus Kunth is a highly invasive grass, but the importance of the seed reproduction for its spread has not been evaluated in Cerrado. This study measured the seed reproduction of A. gayanus by assessing parameters from seed production to seed establishment. The study used replicates in three natural reserves located near Brasilia. In each area, sites adjacent to roads were selected. For seed production, panicles were covered with a fine-mesh cloth to collect the seeds. Seeds were counted and analyzed for viability. After seed dispersal, seeds on the soil surface and 3-cm-deep soil samples were collected. Seeds were counted and germinated, and the soil samples were kept in a greenhouse, to estimate the density of the germinable soil seed bank. For emergence depth, seeds were sown at the surface, 1, 2 or 3 cm depth. For seed longevity, bags of seeds were buried in the field and analyzed for viability monthly. Each inflorescence produced an average of 604 seeds (22% viability). Surface seed density was highest at the road edge (> 5000 seeds/m2), with average germination of 29%. Mean soil seed bank reached 232 seedlings/m2 at the roadside. Seeds were able to emerge from all burying depths. The viability of buried seeds decreased to 2% after 1 year. Only seedlings by the border were able to establish. Data show a massive investment in seeds, with low recruitment. We recommend that A. gayanus be controlled by impairing its dispersal, to prevent the establishment of new seedlings.
