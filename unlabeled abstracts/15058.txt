Canopy manipulations of exotic Bitter Willow (Salix elaeagnos) forest for indigenous seedling recruitment: A pilot study
The invasive exotic tree species Bitter Willow (Salix elaeagnos; Salicaceae) has colonised areas of rank exotic grassland and has been found to contain indigenous seed, dispersed by frugivorous birds into the monospecific stands. This small pilot study examined whether indigenous seedlings that have germinated in the understorey of exotic Bitter Willow stands could be stimulated to establish through the creation of small-scale canopy gaps. In Bitter Willow forest, four single Bitter Willow trees were poisoned to create canopy gaps. Light transmission and seedling regeneration of tree and shrub species were assessed beneath both the four manipulated and three comparable intact Bitter Willow canopies. Over 3 years, seedling height and density increased more beneath opened compared to intact Bitter Willow canopies. These results suggest that Bitter Willow can fill the roles of both a facilitative nurse and a perch tree. Larger-scale canopy manipulation experiments of both Bitter Willow and other Salix species are needed to determine the full potential of canopy manipulations for forest restoration.
