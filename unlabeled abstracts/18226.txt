Spreading-vanishing dichotomy in a degenerate logistic model with general logistic nonlinear term
In this paper, we study the degenerate logistic equation with a free boundary and general logistic term in higher space dimensions and heterogeneous environment, which is used to describe the spreading of a new or invasive species. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of the local solution for the free boundary problem by the contraction mapping theorem, then we show that the solution can be expanded to all time using suitable estimates. Finally, we prove the spreading-vanishing dichotomy.
