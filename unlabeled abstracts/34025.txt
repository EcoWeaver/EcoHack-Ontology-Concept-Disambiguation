The Ecology of Small Mammals in Northeastern Tasmania .2. Pseudomys-Novaehollandiae and the Introduced Mus-Musculus
Pseudomys novaehollandiae and the introduced Mus musculus were sympatric and restricted to dry heathland in north-eastern Tasmania. Both species preferred the same floristic groups, and captures of both were positively correlated with floristic richness and negatively correlated with vegetation cover less than 50 cm high. P. novaehollandiae and M. musculus also had a similar diet of stem and leaf tissue, seed and insects. Spatial separation of the species was not shown.
