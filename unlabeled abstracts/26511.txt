The Effects of Habitat on Dispersal Patterns of an Invasive Thistle, Cynara Cardunculus
Dispersal of offspring is a critical step in the spread of invasive species, yet dispersal patterns are seldom well studied, inhibiting effective management and ecological understanding of invasions. Dispersal patterns can be affected by characteristics of the parent plant and by climatic or site characteristics, including community vegetation structure, but these factors have not been studied in the context of plant invasion processes. Cynara cardunculus (L.) is a polycarpic perennial thistle invasive in coastal grasslands in California that produces large numbers of wind-dispersed seeds. This study quantified and compared C. cardunculus dispersal patterns in an exotic grassland (vegetated site) and an agricultural field (non-vegetated site). Seed size variation in C. cardunculus was also quantified within inflorescences, between inflorescences, and between years of production, and compared across dispersal distances. Results indicate that dispersal distance increased dramatically from less than 20m in the vegetated site to more than 40m in the non-vegetated site. Plants producing fewer seeds produced heavier seeds and dispersal distance decreased over time, but seed size was not related to dispersal distance, which may serve to spread the risk to seeds or seedlings across the environment. C. cardunculus has great potential for dispersal in open areas such as agricultural fields or disturbed sites, but may be limited in highly structured natural communities. Management of C. cardunculus and other wind-dispersed plant invasions may be improved by prioritizing populations with open or disturbed areas downwind and minimizing the removal of vegetation during dispersal.
