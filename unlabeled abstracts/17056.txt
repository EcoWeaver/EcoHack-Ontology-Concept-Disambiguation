Proportion of exotics and relatedness of host species mediate the positive effect of plant richness on the species richness of fruit flies
1. All else being equal, the greater the local species richness of plants, the greater the number of associated herbivore species. Because most herbivore insects feed on a subset of closely related plant species, plant phylogenetic diversity is expected to play a key role in determining the number of herbivore species. What is not well known, however, is how an increase in the species richness of exotic plants affects the species richness of herbivores.2. In this study, we used plant-fruit fly interactions to investigate the influence of the proportion and species richness of exotic host plants on the species richness of herbivorous insects. We also tested whether the phylogenetic diversity of host plants increases when the number of exotic plant species increases.3. We found that the species richness of fruit flies is more accurately predicted by the richness of native host plants than by total plant species richness (including both native and exotic species). The proportion of exotic host species and the phylogenetic diversity of host plants had negative and positive effects, respectively, on the species richness of fruit flies.4. Our findings suggest that a positive effect of plant richness on herbivore richness occurs only when an increase in plant diversity involves plant species with which native herbivores share some evolutionary history.
