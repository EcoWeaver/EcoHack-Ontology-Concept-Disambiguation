Pollen dispersal slows geographical range shift and accelerates ecological niche shift under climate change
Significance Will plants species survive climate warming? By which mechanisms? Ignoring pollen dispersal, previous models have predicted that species may escape extinction by tracking in space the climatic conditions to which they were previously adapted. Using quantitative genetics models, we demonstrate that plants dispersing their pollen could survive under a faster climate change than expected: pollen dispersal slows the range shift in space but facilitates the evolution of new climatic niche limits, such that the species becomes adapted to warmer conditions. Therefore, current predictions of the future spatial distribution of plants, as well as current assessments of the extinction risk due to climate warming, could be significantly altered for plants, especially those dispersing pollen far compared with seeds.
