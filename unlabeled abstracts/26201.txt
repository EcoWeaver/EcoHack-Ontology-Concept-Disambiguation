Molecular techniques, wildlife management and the importance of genetic population structure and dispersal: a case study with feral pigs
There was a substantial difference in the geographical size of the identified populations (Table 2), with larger geographical populations occurring in the south (Collie and Muir; Fig. 1b). This probably reflects the relatively recent invasion of these southern regions by feral pigs (Long 2003; Twigg 2003). In the northern populations (Perth Hills, Serpentine and Dandalup), which have been infested with feral pigs since early European settlement (1870s; Long 2003), there were high levels of genetic differentiation between populations found on neighbouring watercourses, even those only 25 km apart (Fig. 1b). In contrast, in the southern populations (Collie, Muir and Denbarker), which have only been known for 5-30 years, feral pigs occurred in relatively large populations, with undifferentiated groups up to 100 km apart (Fig. 1b). The Denbarker population has only been known for the last 5 years, and from the very high FST and RST values calculated between this population and all others studied, it appears unrelated to the populations to the north and west. This population has probably resulted from a recent release of either domestic pigs or feral pigs from outside southern Western Australia, rather than invasion from a neighbouring population (i.e. Muir; Fig. 1b). The lack of differentiation within the Muir population, in particular, is not surprising given that feral pigs have only been known in reasonable numbers in this area for the last 10 years. Similarly, several other animal species (e.g. jaguars Panthera onca; Eizirik et al. 2001) that have undergone very recent geographical range expansions also show very little genetic structuring, as the 'speed of the expansion' does not allow sufficient time for extensive population differentiation (Cabe 1998; Davies, Villablanca & Roderick 1999).
