Understanding invasions: the rise and fall of diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa) in North America
The relative importance of mechanisms explaining the invasiveness and dominance of alien plant species remains a subject of active debate. Diffuse knapweed has been identified as a strong competitor capable of using allelopathic chemicals to achieve dominance in plant communities that have not coevolved with this species. Positive feedbacks with soil biota may further enhance the competitive abilities of Centaurea species. The failure of classical biological control after 30 years of effort was seen as negative evidence for the enemy escape hypothesis as a mechanism explaining dominance. However, control of this invasive species by insect herbivory now appears to have been achieved in widely separated ecosystems in North America. While we do not know if these same insects exerted this regulatory function in the native habitat of diffuse knapweed, we do see top-down controls operating effectively in the invaded ecosystems. Traits conferring strong competition such as enhanced rates of allelopathic chemical production or those produced by new plant--microbial interactions formed when exotic plants enter new communities can be negated by biological control mechanisms.
