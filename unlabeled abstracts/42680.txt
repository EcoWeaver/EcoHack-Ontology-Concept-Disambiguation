Effects of Soil Moisture Condition and Shading on Growth of Invasive Plant Burcucumber (Sicyos angulatus L.)
Burcucumber (Sicyos angulatus) is an annual invasive plant species originated from North America. This species grows by twining around tree trunks, and blocks other plants from photosynthesis. Thus, it has caused the destruction of the ecosystem and biological diversity by threatening native plants. This study was performed to find out the effect of different soil water content (20%, 13%, 10%, 3%) and various shading degrees (0%, 60%, 80%) on the growth and photosynthesis-related activity of burcucumber. In the responses of burcucumber to soil water content, plant height (PH), leaf length (LL), leaf width (LW) and photosynthetic efficiency (PE) were lower at 20% water content than 10% reflecting that burcucumber plant grow well in the less dry soil and shows poor growth under wet soil condition. In shading experiment, PH, LL, LW and PE were lower at 80% than 60% shading and in general, the growth characteristics were lowered as the shading intensity increased. The improved growth of burcucumber under highly or moderately shaded condition implies that the plant can grow well without growth retardation and can be adapted to shading condition with other tall plant species including tree. Further study on the combination effects of above factors should be conducted in future for effective ecological control of burcucumber.
