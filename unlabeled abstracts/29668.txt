Why is the productivity of Douglas-fir higher in New Zealand than in its native range in the Pacific Northwest, USA?
Douglas-fir (Pseudotusga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), a native to the Pacific Coast Range in North America, is recognized as a tree that is long-lived and can grow rapidly to standing volumes that approach the highest recorded for temperate conifers. Managed plantations in western Oregon register maximum periodic annual increments (PAI) at ages between 20 and 40 years of ~30m3ha-1year-1. The same seed source, when planted in New Zealand and elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere, may attain a PAI of ~50m3ha-1year-1. Is this higher productivity mainly related to climate or to isolation from native pests? To evaluate the role of climate, we obtained meteorological data from plantation sites in New Zealand and Oregon, from which we established relationships between mean monthly temperature extremes and solar irradiance, air humidity deficits, and frost frequency. Using these empirical relationships, long-term weather records were converted to the meteorological variables required to drive a process-based forest growth model, 3-PG, for sites approaching the most productive in New Zealand and in Oregon. Annual precipitation is similar in both areas, but sites in Oregon receive only 10% during the growing season, resulting in humidity deficits 30% larger than those recorded in New Zealand. According to sensitivity analyses and direct measurements, the more productive Douglas-fir forests in Oregon avoid the limiting effects of summer drought by obtaining water from the subsoil and fractured bedrock. If such forests were under a reduced evaporative demand similar to that in New Zealand, we show that they would exhibit comparable productivity.
