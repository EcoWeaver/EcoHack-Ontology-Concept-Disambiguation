Sporobolus indicus (L.) R. Br. (Gramineae), a new adventive species in the flora of Serbia
During field studies of semi-saline meadows and marshes carried out along the Ponjavica River in the vicinity of Banatski Brestovac (Vojvodina, Serbia), we found several specimens of Sporobolus indicus (L.) R. Br. The plant grows in transitional zones between disturbed damp mesotrophic grassland vegetation and semiaquatic communities belonging to the alliance Bolboschoenion maritimi continentale Soo. This adventive and potentially invasive species with a worldwide distribution has never before been recorded in Serbia.
