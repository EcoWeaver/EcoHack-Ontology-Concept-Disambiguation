Chapter 16 Globalization and Bioinvasions: The International Policy Problem
Abstract Invasive species control is a public good. Once provided, the benefits it offers in terms of enhanced protection of human, animal, and plant health, and the productivity of agriculture, forestry, aquaculture, and fisheries, are available to everyone. Like all public goods it will be undersupplied if left to the market. This makes it a collective responsibility -- a legitimate role of government at many different scales. This role involves two different functions. One is the development of broad strategies and supporting institutions, statutes, regulations, or agreements for addressing the problem. A second function involves the implementation of that policy, and specifically the use of public resources to undertake all of the actions described in this volume: inspection and interception at the port of entry; sanitary and phytosanitary measures both along pathways; and in situ detection, eradication, and control of harmful species that have been introduced, established, and spread. This chapter considers both broad issues of policy and specific challenges to management.
