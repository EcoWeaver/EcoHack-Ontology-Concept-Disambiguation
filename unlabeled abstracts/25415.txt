Effect of generalist insect herbivores on introduced Lepidium draba (Brassicaceae): implications for the enemy release hypothesis
The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) states that decreased regulation by natural enemies allows plants to increase in distribution, abundance and vigour following their introduction into an exotic range. Invasive plants rarely escape herbivory entirely, and for hoary cress [Lepidium draba L. (Brassicaceae)] it has been demonstrated that generalist insect abundance is greater in its introduced North American range than in the native European range. We assessed the role of increased generalist herbivory on hoary cress using representatives of four important herbivore niches commonly found in the introduced range. We experimentally examined the density dependent impact of these herbivores individually and in combination on hoary cress in a series of greenhouse experiments. We found that defoliation of the oligophagous diamondback moth Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lep., Plutellidae) had the strongest and most consistent impact, while damage by the stem-mining weevil Ceutorhynchus americanus Buchanan (Col., Curculionidae) tended to have the highest per capita effect. Plant response to feeding by the oligophagous crucifer flea beetle Phyllotreta cruciferae (Goeze) (Col., Chrysomelidae) was minor despite obvious feeding damage, and the impact of the polyphagous tarnished plant bug Lygus hesperus Knight (Het., Miridae) was negligible. In multiple-species experiments, herbivore impacts were usually additive. In general, we found that hoary cress can tolerate high densities of oligophagous insect herbivory and effectively resisted attack by the polyphagous L. hesperus, but also the oligophagous C. americanus. Our results indicate that a combination of plant resistance and tolerance allows hoary cress to withstand increased generalist herbivore load in its introduced range, consistent with the predictions of the ERH.
