Population ecology of the invasive kelp Undaria pinnatifida towards the upper extreme of its temperature range
Understanding how the growth and life cycle of an invasive species relate to temperature is fundamental to predicting potential distribution and impacts. This paper investigates how the population ecology of the invasive kelp Undaria pinnatifida relates to water temperature in the warm-temperate waters of north-eastern New Zealand, one of the warmest water populations in the world and a region previously thought to be suboptimal for U. pinnatifida colonisation. Monitoring of U. pinnatifida on artificial structures over three growth seasons revealed an annual growth cycle, with one main recruitment event in winter ~2 months after water temperatures dropped below ~15 degC. Sporophyte growth rates peaked in late winter, density and sporophyte length peaked in spring and declined rapidly in summer. Density was strongly negatively related to water temperatures 8 weeks prior to sampling, whereas relative change in density was most strongly related to water temperature on the day of sampling, with largest declines when temperatures exceeded 20 degC. Densities remained low for varying periods depending on how long temperatures remained above 20 degC. Overall, sporophyte size and growth rates were comparable to those of cooler water populations, but the seasonal cycle was compressed into a shorter period when temperatures were cool enough for recruitment and growth. In warm-temperate and subtropical regions summer temperatures limit the seasonal presence while winter temperatures will ultimately determine the distribution of U. pinnatifida. The strong coupling between U. pinnatifida density and water temperature provides a basis for predicting the future distribution and related impacts of this species under changing climatic conditions.
