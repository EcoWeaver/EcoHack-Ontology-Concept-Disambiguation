Detection of Asian carp DNA as part of a Great Lakes basin-wide surveillance program
Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a sensitive technique for early detection of rare species, including bighead (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) carp, which are incipient invaders of the Great Lakes. Since 2009, 2822 samples have been collected from the Great Lakes basin to delimit the extent of Asian carp incursions. Samples collected in the Chicago Area Waterway System and in the western basin of Lake Erie indicate the presence of Asian carp DNA in the Great Lakes. These positive eDNA detections are within 6 and 4 km from where bighead carps were recovered in Lake Calumet, near Lake Michigan (2010), and from Sandusky Bay, Lake Erie (2000), respectively. To implement a Great Lakes surveillance plan for protecting imperiled species and reducing damages from invasive species, federal, state, and provincial agencies will need to cooperatively plan and implement a surveillance program that employs the unique strengths of multiple sampling tools, including eDNA methods.
