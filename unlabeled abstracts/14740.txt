Monogenean parasites of Lepomis gibbosus Linnaeus introduced into the River Durance, France
The pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus Linnaeus (Centrarchidae), was introduced into the Europe from North America in late 19th century. In this study, we examine monogenean parasites of L. gibbosus from the River Durance in France. We found seven parasite species introduced together with the host: Actinocleidus recurvatus, A. oculatus, Onchocleidus similis, O. dispar, O. acer, Cleidodiscus robustus (Ancyrocephalidae) and Gyrodactylus macrochiri (Gyrodactylidae). Early diporpa (Diplozoidae), accidentally attached to the gills, represent a single parasite species acquired within the area of introduction. Three species, O. acer, C. robustus and G. macrochiri, are reported from Europe for the first time.
