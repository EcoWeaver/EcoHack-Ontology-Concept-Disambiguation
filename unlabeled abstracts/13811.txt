The complete mitochondrial genomes of two globally invasive ants, the Argentine ant Linepithema humile and the little fire ant Wasmannia auropunctata
Ants are among the most widespread and damaging of invasive alien species. Here, we report the complete mitochondrial genomes for two globally invasive ants: the Argentine ant Linepithema humile and the little fire ant Wasmannia auropunctata. The circular genomes of L. humile and W. auropunctata are 15,929 and 16,362 bp in length, respectively, and encode the same typical set of 37 mitochondrial genes (i.e. 13 PCGs, 22 tRNAs and two rRNAs) and one control region. The mitochondrial genome of W. auropunctata harbors a unique gene arrangement ('rrnS-trnV-CR-trnM-trnI-trnQ-nad2-trnW-trnC-trnY'; the underlines indicate inverted genes) between rrnL and cox1. Phylogenetic analysis largely corroborated the traditional taxonomy, except for L. humile which was found to be more related to those taxa of the subfamilies Formicinae and Myrmicinae than to the consubfamilial Leptomyrmex pallens. Our genomic data can be readily used for genetic assays of these two globally invasive ants.
