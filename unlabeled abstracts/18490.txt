Invasive and native populations of common ragweed exhibit strong tolerance to foliar damage
Tolerance and resistance are defence strategies evolved by plants to cope with damage due to herbivores. The introduction of exotic species to a new biogeographical range may alter the plant herbivore interactions and induce selection pressures for new plant defence strategies with a modified resource allocation. To detect evolution in tolerance to herbivory in common ragweed, we compared 3 native (North America) and 3 introduced (France) populations, grown in a common garden environment. We explored the effect of leaf herbivory on plant vegetative and reproductive traits. Plants were defoliated by hand, simulating different degrees of insect grazing by removing 0%, 50% or 90% of each leaf blade. Total and shoot dry biomasses were not affected by increasing defoliation, whereas root dry biomass and root:shoot ratio decreased significantly for native and introduced populations. Furthermore, defoliation treatments did not affect any of the plant reproductive traits measured. Hence, common ragweed displayed an efficient reallocation of resources in shoot biomass at the expense of roots following defoliation, which allows the species to tolerate herbivory without obvious costs for fitness. We did not detect any difference in herbivory tolerance between introduced and native populations, but significant differences were found in reproduction with invasive populations producing more seeds than native populations. As a result, tolerance to herbivory has been maintained in the introduced plant populations. We discuss some implications of these preliminary results for biological control strategies dedicated to common ragweed.
