Edge effects of an invasive species across a natural ecological boundary
Natural habitats adjacent to human-modified areas often suffer edge effects stemming from physical disturbance, elevated predator densities, or invasive species. Although seldom documented, detrimental edge effects can also occur at natural ecological boundaries. Here I examine the spatial pattern and ecological effects of a biological invasion at well-delineated and abrupt edges between riparian corridors and coastal sage scrub at 10 sites in southwestern California. The invasive Argentine ant Linepithema humile thrives in moist riparian corridors but decreases greatly in number with increasing distance into adjacent dry scrub habitats. As L. humile numbers decrease, both the number of native ant workers and the number of native ant species captured in pitfall traps increase. Argentine ants appear to suppress native ants within at least 50 m of riparian corridors, but these effects diminish to undetectable levels by 200 m. At comparable uninvaded sites neither the number of native ant workers nor the number of native ant species captured in pitfall traps varies significantly across riparian-scrub edges. Areas subject to this edge effect may be sinks both for native ants and for organisms that depend on them for food or services. In general edge effects occurring at natural boundaries should receive increased attention as they might disrupt ecosystems not greatly altered by human activity.
