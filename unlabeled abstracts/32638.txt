IMPACTS OF SOLIDAGO GIGANTEA, PRUNUS SEROTINA, HERACLEUM MANTEGAZZIANUM AND FALLOPIA JAPONICA INVASIONS ON ECOSYSTEMS
The world's biodiversity and ecosystems are threatened by the invasion of alien plant species. They have been found to impact the structure in function of ecosystems in temperate, tropical and subtropical areas (Holm et al., 1977; Pysek, 1997; Byers et al., 2002; Ehrenfeld, 2003). We reviewed studies to summarize the impact of four plant species invasions on European ecosystems: Solidago gigantea, Prunus serotina, Heracleum mantegazzianum and Fallopia japonica, because they are amongst a number of invasive species which have spread over the last centuries, and are still increasing their range in Europe. They cause negative impacts on both native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (including productivity, nutrient cycling and soil organic matter dynamics).
