Taxonomic and biogeographic patterns in the native and alien woody flora of Kashmir Himalaya, India
Biodiversity inventories unravel insightful taxonomic and biogeographic patterns that provide valuable inputs in guiding conservation practices and policymaking. Here we present an updated inventory of the native and alien woody flora of the Kashmir Himalaya, India, together with analyses of the patterns of taxonomic composition, geographic distribution, and invasion status of the alien species. The data was assembled from the floristic literature of the last two centuries, supplemented with herbarium records and validated by field surveys over the past decade. In total, the woody flora comprised of 520 species; out of these 322 species were native and 198 alien, yielding a proportion of 38% aliens. Amongst the natives, 16 species are on the IUCN red list 2009. While 37 genera included both native and alien species indicating a potential for hybrid formation, only 15 families were represented by alien species exclusively. Regarding the invasion status, presently 37 alien woody species are naturalized and 7 are invasive in the region. The results show that the Kashmir Himalaya harbours a diverse woody flora. It is concluded that a distinction between the native and the alien flora, as adopted in the present study, is crucial for a meaningful analysis of any biodiversity patterns. We predict that in the near future many alien woody species, presently naturalized in the region, can become serious plant invaders, and therefore need further research efforts and timely management.
