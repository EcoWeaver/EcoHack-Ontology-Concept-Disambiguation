Evolution of genome size in Drosophila. is the invader's genome being invaded by transposable elements?
Genome size varies considerably between species, and transposable elements (TEs) are known to play an important role in this variability. However, it is far from clear whether TEs are involved in genome size differences between populations within a given species. We show here that in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans the size of the genome varies among populations and is correlated with the TE copy number on the chromosome arms. The TEs embedded within the heterochromatin do not seem to be involved directly in this phenomenon, although they may contribute to differences in genome size. Furthermore, genome size and TE content variations parallel the worldwide colonization of D. melanogaster species. No such relationship exists for the more recently dispersed D. simulans species, which indicates that a quantitative increase in the TEs in local populations and fly migration are sufficient to account for the increase in genome size, with no need for an adaptation hypothesis.
