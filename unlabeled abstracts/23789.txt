FIRST RECORD OF GRACILARIA VERMICULOPHYLLA (GRACILARIALES, RHODOPHYTA) IN THE PO DELTA LAGOONS, MEDITERRANEAN SEA (ITALY)1
Molecular outcomes led us to report the first occurrence of the invasive alien species Gracilaria vermiculophylla (Ohmi) Papenf. in the Mediterranean Sea. This species was recorded for the first time in the Po Delta lagoons in May and October 2008, probably introduced by the importation of the Manila clam Tapes philippinarum. At present, G. vermiculophylla is spread only near some clam-farming areas, but its diffusion is expected to increase with the colonization of other lagoons where aquaculture is spread, as already observed for other alien species such as Agardhiella subulata and Solieria filiformis. The present study supplies further information on the morphology of this species, the ecological characteristics of the colonized areas, and the most probable introduction vector, confirming that the species spreading occurs in eutrophic and turbid coastal systems.
