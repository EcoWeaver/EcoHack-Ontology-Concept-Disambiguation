Effects of invasive knapweed (Centaurea stoebe subsp. micranthos) on a threatened native thistle (Cirsium pitcheri) vary with environment and life stage
We examined the type and magnitude of invasive plant (Centaurea stoebe subsp. micranthos (Gugler) Hayek) effects on the demographic parameters of a rare plant (Cirsium pitcheri Torr. & A.Gray), using two seed addition experiments with three treatments in two dune habitats -- lakeshore linear dunes and high perched dunes on Lake Michigan, USA. Treatments were near Centaurea stoebe subsp. micranthos, near a native plant, or in the open. Seedling emergence, establishment, and juvenile survivorship were significantly higher on perched dunes, with higher surface soil moisture, than on lakeshore dunes. Treatment effects varied significantly with habitat and life stage. Seedling establishment decreased near Centaurea stoebe subsp. micranthos on lakeshore dunes, but increased near any neighbor on perched dunes. However, juvenile survival was significantly lower near Centaurea stoebe. subsp. micranthos in both habitats. The probability of reaching the adult flowering stage was much lower, and occurred later, for plants near Centaurea stoebe subsp. micranthos, especially on lakeshore dunes. Thus, Centaurea stoebe subsp. micranthos had a strong negative effect on establishment, survival, and flowering of Cirsium pitcheri, but interaction intensity varied with habitat and life stage. The results suggest that coupling seed addition with watering and invasive plant removal could bolster populations of this rare endemic plant.
