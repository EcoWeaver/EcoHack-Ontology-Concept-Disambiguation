Tandem use of selective insecticides and natural enemies for effective, reduced-risk pest management
Selective chemical insecticides have become the dominant approach for management of recalcitrant and resistant insect pests, and the prospects for use of these chemicals in combination with biocontrol agents are on the rise. These chemical compounds, when used in combination with an effective natural enemy, may provide more comprehensive prophylactic and remedial treatments in the context of an integrated pest management program (IPM) than either approach alone. Many of these compounds have promise for a diversity of applications, including sustainable agriculture, control of urban pests, and invasive species eradication. Unfortunately, there are only a limited number of studies in which the effect of these insecticides on natural enemies has been examined. In this article, we examine the risk of several classes of insecticidal compounds to non-target animals, particularly natural enemies and pollinators, and review the most promising compounds for combined deployment with biological agents.
