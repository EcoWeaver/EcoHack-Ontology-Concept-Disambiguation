Inter-regional hybrids of native and invasive Centaurea solstitialis display intermediate competitive ability
Invasive species can rapidly adapt to conditions in non-native ranges, including changes in size and competitive ability. However, little is known about the heritability of such changes, and on the importance of hypothetical reintroductions in the maintenance of locally adapted traits. To test for this, we experimentally produced a cohort of Centaurea solstitialis of ancestry from either the native range in Spain, the invasive range in California, or inter-regional hybrids from both ranges. We then set up one-to-one competition experiments with the grass Bromus hordeaceus. Centaurea solstitialis individuals grown from seed produced from two Californian parents had almost twice the competitive effect on B. hordeaceus than descendants of two Spanish parents, whereas inter-regional hybrids between Spain and California showed intermediate values. These results suggest that, at this stage of invasion, homogenizing gene flow resulting from hypothetical re-introductions from the native range could lower their competitive effects on the invaded plant communities.
