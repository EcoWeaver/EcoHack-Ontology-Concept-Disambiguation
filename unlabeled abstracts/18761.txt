Major effects of glucosinolates and minor effects of erucic acid on predation of Brassica seeds by mice
Seeds of cultivars of the crop oil seed rape (Brassica napus) differ widely in their content of glucosinolates (GS) and erucic acid (EA), while seeds of the wild relative B. rapa have a high content of both. If mice were to distinguish between the seed types this could affect persistence of plant populations.
