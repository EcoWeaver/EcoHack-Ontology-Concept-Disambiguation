Genetic Diversity of Rhizobia Associated with Acacia longifolia in Two Stages of Invasion of Coastal Sand Dunes
ABSTRACT We examined the genetic diversity of root nodule bacteria associated with the Australian legume Acacia longifolia in two stages of invasion of a coastal sand dune system. All isolates belonged to the genus Bradyrhizobium. A higher diversity was found in the long-established trees. The results suggest the introduction of exotic bradyrhizobia with the plant.
