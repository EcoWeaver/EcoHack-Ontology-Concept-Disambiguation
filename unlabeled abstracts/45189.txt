Invasive species as 'natural hazards' in small island geographical and historical contexts
Although the role of invasive species in altering the environment in small island contexts is a well-recognised problem and topic in environmental history, including viewing invasive species as 'natural hazards', studies have been primarily focused on single islands or associated groups of islands, and usually within the scope of the past few centuries, or since the global expansion of European colonialism. In this paper, I expand the time frame to include pre-modern patterns and processes of human-abetted species invasion in small island contexts.
