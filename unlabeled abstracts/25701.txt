Collections of the invasive species Grateloupia turuturu (Halymeniales, Rhodophyta) from Tasmania, Australia
Intertidal collections of morphologically variable red algal blades from Bicheno on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia, during two consecutive excursions (January 2004, 2005) were strongly reminiscent of alien populations of Grateloupia turuturu collected by the authors in Rhode Island, USA. Anatomical observations of vegetative and reproductive features in combination with molecular tools were used to confirm this identification and establish the first published record for this invasive species in Australian waters.
