Synergistic effects of soil nutrient level and native species identity and diversity on biotic resistance to Sicyos angulatus, an invasive species
Sicyos angulatus is a serious threat to riverine ecosystem functions and services worldwide. Here, we studied the effect of species identity and diversity on biotic resistance to S. angulatus under two different soil nutrient levels (unfertilized vs. fertilized). Soil nutrient levels showed no significant effect on invasion by S. angulatus in the control treatment, where intervention by native plants was absent. Species identity of native plants and its interaction with soil nutrient levels had a significant effect on biotic resistance to S. angulatus. For instance, Pennisetum alopecuroides and Lespedeza cuneata best resisted invasion in fertilized soil, whereas Lespedeza bicolor and Lactuca indica best resisted invasion in unfertilized soil. In addition, a mixture of four plant species resisted invasion equally as well as the monoculture of a species in unfertilized soil, whereas the mixed treatment resisted invasion much better in fertilized soil compared with unfertilized soil. Structural equation modeling revealed that species identity and diversity as well as fertilizer application significantly influenced biotic resistance to S. angulatus invasion, while soil nutrients did not influence invasion success directly. Based on these results, we strongly suggest sowing seed mixtures of various species after eradicating S. angulatus plants to prevent re-invasion. Overall, these results demonstrate how native plants rely on resource availability to resist colonization by an invasive plant, such as S. angulatus. This information can be used for the development of improved guidelines for plant restoration and invasive species control.
