A comparative toxicity study between an autochthonous Artemia and a non native invasive species
Acute heavy metal toxicity was compared in nauplii of an autochthonous Artemia parthenogenetica (Branchiopoda, Anostraca) from Saline di Cervia (Ravenna, Italy) and of a non native commercially available A. franciscana. No significant difference in sensitivity was detected between two species.
