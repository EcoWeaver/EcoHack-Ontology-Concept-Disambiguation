Duration of freezing necessary to damage the leaves ofFallopia japonica(Houtt.) Ronse Decraene
Fallopia japonica (Houtt.) Ronse Decraene is an invasive plant species that introduces economic, social, and environmental stresses. After observing frost damage to F. japonica plants in the field, we exposed leaves of F. japonica and a native species (Acer saccharum Marshall) to freezing temperatures in the laboratory and compared their net photosynthetic rate to that of fresh leaves. In both species, the net photosynthetic rate of leaves frozen for 0.5 h or for 1 h were not significantly different from each other but were both significantly less than that of fresh leaves. Fresh leaves of F. japonica had a higher net photosynthetic rate than those of A. saccharum, but the relationship was reversed in all freezing treatments. Frozen leaves of F. japonica contained microscopically visible frost lenses, which revealed the mechanism of the damage. These results quantify how quickly F. japonica is damaged by freezing conditions and suggest that minimum vernal temperatures may limit its range expansion.
