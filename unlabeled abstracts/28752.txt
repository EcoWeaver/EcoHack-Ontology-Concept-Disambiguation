Some Aspects of the Population Ecology of the Exotic Amphipod, Talitroides Topitotum, in an Atlantic Forest Reserve in Brazil
A study was conducted to determine the population ecology of Talitroides topitotum (T. topitotum) in an Atlantic forest area in south-eastern Brazil. The study was conducted under humid climate, with no-dry season, and the mean yearly precipitation of 2180 mm. Sampling for the study was done by making pitfall traps made of 500 mL plastic cups with 8.5 cm opening, set level with the soil surface, and containing 30% propylene glycol, 0.1% formaldehyde, and a few drops of detergent to break the surface tension. The study showed that the body size of these species was positively correlated with female fecundity. The present study also clarified how temperature affected recruitment in this species and correlation of body size with female fecundity. The study also revealed that presence and abundance of terrestrial amphipods can be used as a tool for bio-monitoring activities of these species.
