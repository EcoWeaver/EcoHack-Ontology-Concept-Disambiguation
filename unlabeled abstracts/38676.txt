Food depletion regulates the demography of invasive dreissenid mussels in a stratified lake
Lake stratification produces sharp gradients in temperature and pelagic resources which have cascading effects on the traits of aquatic populations, including invasive species and their ecosystem impacts. We study the consequences of such common environmental gradients on the demography of quagga mussels, one of the world's most aggressive invasive species. Coupling a series of in situ experiments with a biophysical model of the pelagic community, we quantify mussel growth and recruitment in littoral vs. profundal benthic habitats of eastern Lake Erie. We found that both severe food depletion and cold temperatures in the hypolimnion during summer stratification cause mussels to grow twice as slowly and currently inhibit recruitment in profundal compared to littoral habitats. Together with the high biomass and large mean mussel size found in long-term monitoring surveys in the profundal habitats, our results imply that mussels successfully colonizing profundal habitats have relatively long lifespans with low growth rates, and therefore lower productivity, compared to mussels in shallow areas. Consequently, the bulk of dreissenid biomass in Lake Erie and other Great Lakes found in the vast but resource-poor profundal habitats may have very limited impacts on epilimnetic communities compared to mussels in littoral areas. By contrast, mussels in profundal habitats strongly reduce food availability to hypolimnetic communities throughout the year. Thus, our results explain how the ecosystem impacts of sessile freshwater invaders are likely to vary among habitats and lakes depending on the relative size of profundal populations and the extent of stratification.
