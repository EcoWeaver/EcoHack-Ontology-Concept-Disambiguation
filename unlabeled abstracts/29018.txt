Trophic polymorphism in bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) introduced into Lake Biwa: evidence from stable isotope analysis
Trophic polymorphism was recently reported in introduced bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) in Lake Biwa, Japan, where three morphs are specialized in benthic invertebrates (benthivorous type), submerged aquatic Trophic polymorphism was recently reported in introduced bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) in Lake Biwa, Japan, where three morphs are specialized in benthic invertebrates (benthivorous type), submerged aquatic plants (herbivorous type), and zooplankton (planktivorous type). We evaluated the long-term effects of food resource utilization plants (herbivorous type), and zooplankton (planktivorous type). We evaluated the long-term effects of food resource utilization by these trophic morphs using stable isotope ratios, d15N and d13C. A significant difference in d15N was found between the benthivorous and planktivorous types. The planktivorous type had the higher d15N value, which corresponded with the value expected from its prey, zooplankton. The lower d15N value of the benthivorous type would be derived from the lower d15N values of benthic prey organisms compared to zooplankton. These results support previous findings that the benthivorousvorous and planktivorous types have different food resource utilization. In contrast, the d15N and d13C values of the herbivorous type were distinctly different from the expected values, indicating that this type was unlikely and planktivorous types have different food resource utilization. In contrast, the d15N and d13C values of the herbivorous type were distinctly different from the expected values, indicating that this type was unlikely to utilize aquatic plants substantially, contradicting the results of the dietary analysis. to utilize aquatic plants substantially, contradicting the results of the dietary analysis.
