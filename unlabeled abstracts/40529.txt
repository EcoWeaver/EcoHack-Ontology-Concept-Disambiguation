Invasion establishment and habitat suitability of Chromolaena odorata (L.) King and Robinson over time and space in the western Himalayan forests of India
Habitat suitability assessment of the invasive species Chromolaena odorata (L.) King and Robinson from Himalayan forests reveal some interesting findings and conclusions. Out of the total 72 species recorded from different study sites, 29 were found exotic and invasive belonging to 21 genera and 8 families. Indigenous species accounted for 59% of the total species represented by 26 genera and 11 families. Perennials outnumbered the annuals in all the study sites. C. odorata and Lantana camara L. were the only invasive species to be found common in all the sites with high IVI values. The present work reveals that sites with high biotic pressure, maximum temperature variation, open forest canopy and free from herbivory are the most suitable habitat for the growth of C. odorata. An elevated (P), (K), (Mg), (SOM), (N) and acidic soil from all the invaded sites were found to be the possible reason for further invasion of C. odorata.
