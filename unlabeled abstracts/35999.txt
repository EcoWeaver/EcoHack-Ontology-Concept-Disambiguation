Bythotrephes cederstroemi (Schoedler) in Muskoka Lakes: First Records of the European Invader in Inland Lakes in Canada
The large predaceous European zooplankter Bythotrephes cederstroemi is now present in eight large recreational lakes in south-central Ontario, Canada: Lake Muskoka, Lake Joseph, Lake Rosseau, Fairy Lake, Mary Lake, Peninsula Lake, Lake Vernon, and Go Home Lake. These observations represent the first evidence that B. cederstroemi has invaded inland lakes in Canada, and we suggest that close monitoring is now needed to establish whether or not pelagic food webs of the lakes will respond.
