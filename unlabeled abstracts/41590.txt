Semi-field demographic performance of the invasive planthopper, Orosanga japonica (Hemiptera: Ricaniidae) on two host plants
Orosanga japonica Melichar (Hemiptera: Ricaniidae) is an invasive polyphagous pest in Iran. The planthopper damaged host plants by sap-sucking and egg laying on new twigs. This study aimed to determine the life table parameters of O. japonica on Rubus ulmifolius Schoot (elm leaf blackberry) and Melia azedarach L. (chinaberry) under field conditions in Rudsar (North of Iran) during 2019-2020. The collected life history data were analyzed based on age-stage, two-sex life table theory. The results showed that the incubation period of O. japonica was too long ( 270 days) on both host plants. The nymphs emerged from mid-May 2020. The planthopper had five nymphal stages under field conditions. The nymphal duration was 41.39 +- 0.56 days and 38.13 +- 0.62 days on R. ulmifolius and M. azedarach, respectively. The total preadult survival rates were 53.2% and 51.7% on R. ulmifolius and M. azedarach, respectively. Based on the results, a significant shorter total developmental time was observed on M. azedarach. When adults emerged in late July, they laid eggs after 26.05 days and 26.75 days on R. ulmifolius and M. azedarach, respectively. The fecundity on M. azedarach (131.69 egg/female) was significantly higher than that on R. ulmifolius. However, the life table parameters were all not significantly different on the two host plants. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) were 0.0097 +- 0.0005 day-1 and 0.0105 +- 0.0006 day-1 on R. ulmifolius and M. azedarach, respectively. Generally, these findings could be helpful to establish an efficient management strategy for this exotic pest.
