A new alien fish in the Mediterranean Sea: Champsodon nudivittis (Actinopterygii: Perciformes: Champsodontidae)
A single specimen of nakedband gaper, Champsodon nudivittis (Ogilby, 1895), indigenous to the Indo West Pacific, was captured on 18 January 2008 from the Iskenderun Bay, Turkey. This is the first record of this species in the Mediterranean Sea. The most likely way of introduction would be via ships' ballast waters.
