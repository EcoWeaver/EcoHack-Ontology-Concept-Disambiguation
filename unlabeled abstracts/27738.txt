Eradications of invasive alien species in Europe: a review
Eradication of alien species is a key conservation tool to mitigate the impacts caused by biologic invasions. The aim of the present paper is to review the eradications successfully completed in Europe and to discuss the main limits to a wider application of this management option in the region. On the basis of the available literature -- including conference proceedings, national reports to the Bern Convention, etc. -- a total of 37 eradication programmes have been recorded. Thirty-three eradications were carried out on islands and four on the mainland. The rat (Rattus spp.) has been the most common target (n = 25, 67%), followed by the rabbit (n = 4). In many cases, these eradications determined a significant recovery of native biodiversity. Differently to other regions of the world, no eradications of alien inverte-brates and marine organisms have been recorded; regarding invasive alien plants, it appears that only some very localized removals have been completed so far in Europe. The limited number of eradications carried out in Europe so far is probably due to the limited awareness of the public and the decision makers, the inadequacy of the legal framework, and the scarcity of resources. Synthetic guidelines for improving the ability of European states to respond to aliens incursions are presented.
