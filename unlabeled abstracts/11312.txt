Bacterial invasion: a new strategy to dominate cytoskeleton plasticity.
Some bacterial pathogens enter mammalian cells by injecting, directly into the host cytosol, proteins that trigger cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for internalization. In the February 27 issue of Molecular Cell, McGhie et al. identify mechanisms by which the Salmonella protein SipA interferes with ADF/cofilin and gelsolin function. Thus Salmonella not only triggers actin polymerization but also counteracts the major F-actin destabilizing proteins.
