Public attitudes to the management of invasive non-native species in Scotland
Invasive non-native species are one of the main threats to biodiversity. Consequently there is a need to control or eradicate those species that are causing problems in order to mitigate their impact. Such management programmes can be controversial and in some cases have been delayed or halted because of opposition from pressure groups. Public support can be critical to the success of such projects, and understanding the underlying attitudes of the public can help inform outreach education activities. To assess attitudes towards invasive species management and investigate socio-demographic factors influencing such attitudes, a questionnaire survey of 600 randomly selected members of the public in Scotland was conducted, and a total of 248 completed questionnaires returned. The level of support for control and eradication programmes was, in general, high and was higher amongst men, older people, and people who had previously heard of control and eradication projects. The species to be managed influenced levels of support, and projects to control birds were the least supported. Respondents with prior knowledge of control and eradication programmes and members of conservation organisations, in general, showed higher levels of support, indicating the important role that awareness and education has in terms of increasing public support for invasive non-native species management projects.
