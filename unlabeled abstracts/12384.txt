Opportunistic discrimination of alien eggs by social wasps ( Polistes biglumis , Hymenoptera Vespidae): a defense against social parasitism?
Foundresses of the social wasp Polistes biglumis were tested to see whether they were able to recognize alien eggs experimentally introduced into their own nests. Foundresses removed alien conspecific reproductive-destined eggs while they accepted worker-destined eggs. The results indicate that social wasps discriminate among eggs and that they discriminate against alien eggs destined to produce unrelated reproductives. P. biglumis is a strictly solitary founding species, with no reproductive competition within colonies; thus, brood discrimination abilities could have evolved as a counteradaptation against intra- and inter-specific brood parasitism.
