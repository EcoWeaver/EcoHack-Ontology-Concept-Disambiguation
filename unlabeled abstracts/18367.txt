Effects of Bromus tectorum invasion on microbial carbon and nitrogen cycling in two adjacent undisturbed arid grassland communities
Soil nitrogen (N) is an important compo-nent in maintaining ecosystem stability, and the introduction of non-native plants can alter N cycling by changing litter quality and quantity, nutrient uptake patterns, and soil food webs. Our goal was to determine the effects of Bromus tectorum (C 3) invasion on soil microbial N cycling in adjacent non-invaded and invaded C 3 and C 4 native arid grasslands. We monitored resin-extractable N, plant and soil d 13 C and d 15 N, gross rates of inorganic N mineralization and consumption, and the quantity and isotopic composition of microbial phospholipid biomarkers. In invaded C 3 communities, labile soil organic N and gross and net rates of soil N transformations increased, indicating an increase in overall microbial N cycling. In invaded C 4 communities labile soil N stayed constant, but gross N flux rates increased. The d 13 C of phospholipid biomarkers in invaded C 4 communi-ties showed that some portion of the soil bacte-rial population preferentially decomposed invader C 3 -derived litter over that from the native C 4 species. Invasion in C 4 grasslands also significantly decreased the proportion of fungal to bacterial phospholipid biomarkers. Different processes are occurring in response to B. tectorum invasion in each of these two native grasslands that: 1) alter the size of soil N pools, and/or 2) the activity of the microbial commu-nity. Both processes provide mechanisms for altering long-term N dynamics in these ecosystems and highlight how multiple mechanisms can lead to similar effects on ecosystem function, which may be impor-tant for the construction of future biogeochemical process models.
