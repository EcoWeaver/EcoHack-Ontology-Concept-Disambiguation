Cytogenetic and Morphological Characterization of Corbicula fluminalis (O. F. Muller, 1774) (Bivalvia: Veneroida: Corbiculidae): Taxonomic Status Assessment of a Freshwater Clam
Chromosomes of Corbicula fluminalis were characterized by karyotype analysis and nucleolar organizer region (NORs) localization. The triploid chromosome number was confirmed as 54; the karyotype is composed of 3 metacentric, 15 submetacentric and 36 subtelo-acrocentic chromosomes. Silver staining revealed nucleolar organizers on the telomeric regions of three subtelo-acrocentic chromosomes. This is the first study on chromosomes of C. fluminalis. The results are discussed with regards to Corbicula species as well as its relationships to other mollusc species based on cytogenetic characters and morphometric of the shells.
