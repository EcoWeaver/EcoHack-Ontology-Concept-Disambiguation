Beware of oysters. Rapid advance of non-native species in tropical Pacific islands
Non-indigenous species can become a problem for the ecosystem health, especially when their distribution grows to the detriment of native species. In this moment, they can become invasive species. In marine ecosystems, the maritime transport is the principal gate and corridor for the movement of alien species. The genetic identification, using barcoding tools, of different oyster species in ports of the remote French Polynesia islands and atolls, showed a significant increase of exotic versus native oyster species between 2011 and 2018. This supports the spread of exotic species with the maritime traffic as the main cause. Moreover, the 11% of inaccurate identification at species level obtained in this study shows the need to complete the genetic databases.
