Rhizosphere and root fungal community of the invasive plant <i>Galinsoga quadriradiata</i> changes along its elevational expansion route
Fungal communities related to invasive plants may change with elevational gradient, which may affect the performance and invasiveness of invasive plants. Our recent study revealed that the root AMF colonization rate of invasive plant Galinsoga quadriradiata decreased with elevation. However, it is still unclear whether it is caused by the changes of the fungal community along elevation. To address this issue, we used high-throughput sequencing techniques, functional groupings, and linear statistics to examine how the fungal communities in the rhizosphere and roots of G. quadriradiata changed across the elevation in Qinling and Bashan Mountains, China. Our results revealed that species diversity and composition of both the rhizosphere and root fungal communities changed along the elevation. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index in the rhizosphere increased with elevation while that in the roots decreased. In contrast, the relative abundance of pathotroph in the rhizosphere decreased while that in the roots increased with elevation. These suggest that when the invasive plant colonizes into high altitudes, it may not suffer from limited rhizosphere fungal symbionts, but rather the ability of the plant to create and maintain these associations decreases. The invader tends to accumulate more pathogenic fungi in the roots while reducing the dependence on symbiotic fungi during expansion into higher elevations. All in all, our results highlight that the interactions between invasive plants and fungal community substantially changed along elevation, and belowground interactions may be key in our understanding of how invasive plants derive success in stressful, high-elevation environments.
