Global environmental changes more frequently offset than intensify detrimental effects of biological invasions
Significance International concern about the consequences of human-induced global environmental changes has prompted a renewed focus on reducing ecological effects of biological invasions, climate change, and nutrient pollution. Our results show that the combined effects of nonnative species invasions and abiotic global environmental changes are often negative but no worse than invasion impacts alone. Invasion impacts are also more strongly detrimental than warming temperatures or nitrogen deposition, two common stressors. Thus, reducing the spread of invasive species is critical for mitigating harms from anthropogenic changes to global ecosystems.
