Mycorrhizal fungi associated with plantations of Pinus taeda L. from the National University of Asuncion, Paraguay
Four species of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with Pinus taeda L. are cited. This species is estimated to have been introduced to Paraguay during the 20th century and the mycorrhizal mushrooms were inoculated in the roots of the trees, therefore they are considered non-native species. Geastrum minumun Schwein., Pisolithus arrizhus (Scop.) Rauschert, Suillus granulatus and Scleroderma bovista Fr. are cited for the first time for Paraguay. The macroscopic and microscopic characteristics are included as well as a brief description of Pinus taeda L..
