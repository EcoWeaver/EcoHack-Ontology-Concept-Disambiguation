A revision of Jatropha (Euphorbiaceae) in Malesia
Jatropha, a widespread, species rich genus, ranges from the Americas and Caribbean to Africa and India. In Malesia five species occur, all of which were introduced and originated in Central and South America. The five species are revised and an identification key, nomenclature, descriptions, distributions, ecology, vernacular names, uses and notes are provided. Special attention is given to the uses of J. curcas, because it is steadily gaining popularity as a potential biofuel plant and, because of that, is being cultivated more often.
