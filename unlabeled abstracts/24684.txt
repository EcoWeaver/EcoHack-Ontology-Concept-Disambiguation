Combined analysis of four mitochondrial regions allowed the detection of several matrilineal lineages of the lessepsian fishFistularia commersoniiin the Mediterranean Sea
The bluespotted cornetfish (Fistularia commersonii) is an Indo-Pacific species that in the last ten years colonized a large part of the Mediterranean basin. The aim of this study was to sequence some portions of the mitochondrial DNA (D-loop II, 16S, 12S and Cyt b) of this fish from different localities of the Mediterranean Sea, in order to evaluate the level of its genetic variability in this area. The genetic analysis performed on specimens from seven localities of Sardinia, Tunisia and Libya revealed the presence of at least five mitochondrial lineages. The results obtained, compared with previous studies, indicate that the use of a sufficient number of mitochondrial regions may allow a more accurate estimate of genetic variability in lessepsian invasions.
