Potential effects of an invasive seaweed (Caulerpa cylindracea, Sonder) on sedimentary organic matter and microbial metabolic activities
AbstractCaulerpa cylindracea (Sonder), among the most successful marine bio-invaders on a global scale, poses severe threats to biodiversity. However, the effects of this seaweed on the quantity and the biochemical composition of sedimentary organic matter are still poorly known. Since the whole set of sedimentary features affects the availability of substrates for benthic microbial communities, we: i) investigated the biochemical composition of sediments colonized and not-colonized by C. cylindracea, and ii) compared the metabolic patterns of the microbial communities associated with C. cylindracea and in the sediments colonized and not-colonized by the seaweed. Our results show that C. cylindracea can influence the quantity and biochemical composition of sedimentary organic matter (OM), and that microbial populations associated with colonized sediments do have specific metabolic patterns and degradation capacities. Caulerpa cylindracea can also influence the metabolic patterns of the microbial community specifically adapted to degrade compounds released by the seaweed itself, with possible consequences on C cycling.
