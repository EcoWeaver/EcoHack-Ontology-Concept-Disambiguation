Influence of edible fruit coatings onDrosophila suzukii(Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae) oviposition and development
Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) is a highly invasive vinegar fly recently detected in the United States that severely threatens the viability of soft skinned fruit production. Insecticides mitigate some of this damage, but alternative methods to manage D. suzukii infestation are needed. We tested three edible coatings to determine if they could prevent or reduce oviposition by D. suzukii females or affect immature survivorship and development in two important host crops, blueberry and raspberry. None of the coatings prevented oviposition, but some reduced the number of eggs laid. Two carnauba wax-based coatings, PrimaFresh 45 and Raynox, dramatically reduced survivorship of immature D. suzukii in raspberries, but not in blueberries. Our results suggest that obtaining thorough, even coverage in the field will be essential if edible coatings are to be used as a management strategy for D. suzukii.
