Identification of 12 EST-derived SSR markers in Lumbricus rubellus
While many species of earthworms are globally distributed, very little is known about the genetic population dynamics of this diverse group. We present the characterization of novel simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, including primer information, number of alleles, repeat motif, and approximate size ranges, to be used in population genetic analyses of the earthworm Lumbricus rubellus Hoffmeister 1843. Specifically, we designed and characterized 12 novel, polymorphic markers derived from published expressed sequence tags (EST) for amplification in L. rubellus. The mean number of alleles per locus was 6.25 +- 1.91, indicating these markers will be sufficiently polymorphic for population genetic studies of this species.
