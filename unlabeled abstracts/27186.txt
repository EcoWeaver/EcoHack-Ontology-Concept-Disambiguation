A conservation appraisal of the rare and endemic vascular plants of Pitcairn Island
The flora of the Pitcairn Islands consists of 81 species, of which 10 are endemic. IUCN Red List threat categories show that over 60% of the indigenous flora is threatened within the island, and over 20% is threatened globally. To provide a more objective regional assessment that could prioritise conservation management, a system of threat scores was applied to each taxon based on potential threat due to habitat damage or exploitation. The main threats affecting the flora and vegetation are posed by habitat clearance, spread of invasive species, small population sizes or restricted distributions, erosion, lack of a frugivorous bird and exploitation. Addressing these threats by means of a system of nature reserves, species-specific recovery plans and control of invasive species, erosion and exploitation, will start to combat these problems. However, any conservation activities must be implemented in conjunction with the interests of the local community, and in consultation with them, in order to ensure success.
