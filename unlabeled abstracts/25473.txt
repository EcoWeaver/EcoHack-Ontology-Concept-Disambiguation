Allelopathic evidence in Brachiaria decumbens and its potential to invade the Brazilian Cerrados
The aim of this study was to look for evidence of a llelochemicals in B. decumbens , in parts of the plant from where they could easily be released to the environment. T he germination inhibition of Phalaris canariensis , Lactuca sativa (standard species) and Melinis minutiflora , another invasive African grass, was tested using B. decumbens germinating seeds and aqueous leachates of the roo ts, green and senescent leaves, at 5, 10 and 20% w/ v. Both the germinating seeds and the aqueous leachates of B. decumbens reduced the germination of the species tested; the effectiveness of the aqueous leachates increased ac cording to concentration. Apparently, the competiti ve advantage of B. decumbens in the cerrados could be amplified via allelopathy .
