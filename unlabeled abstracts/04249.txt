Revisiting Darwin's conundrum reveals a twist on the relationship between phylogenetic distance and invasibility
Significance The application of phylogenetics is rapidly growing in many areas of biology. In invasion biology, phylogenetic information is now being used in an attempt to understand and predict species invasions. However, there is only a weak foundation for the prevalent predictions of how the phylogenetic distance between native and nonnative species should be related to the invasion success of the nonnative species. In this paper, a mechanistic model of species interactions and evolution is used to generate a unique set of predictions. These predictions deviate significantly from those assumed previously, suggesting that current explanations of phylogenetic distance-invasion relationships must be reevaluated. More generally, the results highlight the importance of considering the details of community processes when interpreting phylogenetic patterns.
