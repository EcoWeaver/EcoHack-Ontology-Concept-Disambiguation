Ecological aspects of the land crab Gecarcinus planatus (Decapoda: gecarcinidae) in Socorro Island, Mexico
The results of a study are presented on the Socorro Island crab Gecarcinus planatus, a species inhabiting this oceanic island in a wide range of communities and altitudes. In February 1990, two transects in the forest community at Socorro Island were sampled and all crabs captured were recorded. Through mark-recapture methods the population density was estimated, and the individual home ranges were determined by means of Component Bivariate Model. The structure and phenology of the vegetation was recorded in the same two transects. It seems that crab density is related to cover of trees, particularl to Ficus cotinifolia, Guettarda insularis, and Bumelia socorrensis. In addition, the phenology of G. insularis also seems to be important to crab distribution. Home range of G. planatus is inversely associated to crab population density. Vegetation communities in Socorro Island are endangered by sheep overgrazing, so densities and home ranges of the crab in this forest may be affected in the future. To determine the real impact of exotic species on the structure and function of the communities present in Socorro Island (such as feral sheep) it will be necessary to study the relationships between vegetation and the different animal populations in the areas not strongly disturbed.
