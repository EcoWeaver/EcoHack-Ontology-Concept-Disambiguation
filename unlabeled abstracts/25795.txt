Impact of invasive mammal species on natural ecosystems: An example of the Prioksko-Terrasnyi Biosphere Reserve
On the basis of Annals of Nature of the Prioksko-Terrasnyi Biosphere Reserve, its colonization by invasive mammal species and the current state of their populations have been analyzed. In the mammal fauna of the reserve, 13 out of 60 species can be classified as invasive. They differ in the degree of impact on the biota. The house mouse, Norway and black rats, and European bison have virtually no effect on natural ecosystems; the effect of the muskrat, raccoon dog, American mink, red and axis deer is insignificant; and that of stray dogs and Tartarian roe deer is considerable. The European beaver and wild boar play an environment-forming role. The impact of beaver activities is strong but local, whereas activities of wild boars put into question the very possibility of conservation and analysis of representative biosphere areas and biological diversity in the reserve.
