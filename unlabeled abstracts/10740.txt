Unpalatability and Toxicity of an Introduced Species (Cinnabar Moth Larvae) to Native Predators
The acceptability of an introduced species of prey, cinnabar moth caterpillars, Tyria jacobaeae, to three species of sympatric predators and one allopatric predator was examined. These caterpillars were toxic to three alligator lizards tested, completely avoided by short-tailed shrews, and avoided after one contact by deermice and western fence lizards. These results suggest that some predators learn to avoid toxic caterpillars but that this toxic-introduced species may have a negative impact on populations of other predators.
