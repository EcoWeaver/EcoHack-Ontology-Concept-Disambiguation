Exotic Collembola on subantarctic islands: pathways, origins and biology
Three exotic species of Collembola are here identified in collections made during surveys on subantarctic South Georgia in the summers of 2005/2006 and 2009/2010. Previously, only two exotic species of Collembola were known from the island. Increased visitation by tourists, research and maintenance personnel seems an obvious cause despite strict quarantine controls imposed on all visitors. The biology, habitat and distribution of the new species records indicated that fresh vegetables, imported in past years, were their likely means of dispersal to the island. A risk analysis based on their current distribution and ecology was conducted for exotic collembolan species that could invade South Georgia. Pathway analysis of the species with the highest risk scores suggested additional quarantine management protocols could include fumigation of imported fresh food, and this is recommended to minimise the risk of further invasions. A review of exotic Collembola in the Antarctic and subantarctic is provided and the biological traits of Collembola are discussed in relation to their invasion potential.
