Differences in larval dynamics of golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei between dam reservoirs with and without an aeration system
The golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei is a freshwater bivalve that adheres to water intake facilities, leading to problems of several kinds. Biofouling problems have been increasing recently in East Asia and South America, and the planktonic stage of this species is considered to play an important role in its dispersal. We investigated the larval dynamics of L.fortunei in two reservoirs, Lake Ohshio and Lake Takenuma, which are connected by a headrace channel. An aeration system for water quality conservation was present in the former reservoir but not in the latter. Larval density in Lake Ohshio was more than 10,000individuals/m3 with a maximum of 80,000individuals/m3 in summer. The density in Lake Takenuma was much lower, with a maximum of around 200individuals/m3. Water temperature (WT) and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration were almost uniform regardless of water depth in Lake Ohshio because of destratification due to continuous aeration. Summer WT and DO in the lake were considered to be suitable for survival and reproduction of L.fortunei. On the other hand, stratification was found for WT and DO in Lake Takenuma throughout the summer. The low WT and DO found in the deep areas of the lake in summer were considered to be not suitable for survival and reproduction of this species. Thus, the population of L.fortunei larvae differed widely even in two adjoining lakes, and WT and DO are considered to be critical factors, especially for reproduction.
