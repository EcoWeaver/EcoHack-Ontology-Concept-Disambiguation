Resident spiders as predators of the recently introduced light brown apple moth,Epiphyas postvittana
The invasive light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), has not reached damaging levels on crops in California (USA), suggesting that its populations and impact are limited by generalist natural enemies. In a series of laboratory experiments, we examined resident spiders as predators of E. postvittana larvae on two host plants, the ornamental Australian tea tree, Leptospermum laevigatum (Gaertn.) F. Muell (Myrtaceae), and the weed French broom, Genista monspessulana (L.) L.A.S. Johnson (Fabaceae). Of three abundant spider species in Australian tea tree, two hunting spiders measurably reduced the numbers of E. postvittana larvae and plant damage, whereas a web-weaving spider had no detectable impact. The adult stage of the dominant hunting spider Anyphaena aperta Banks (Anyphaenidae) consumed E. postvittana larvae, but neither large nor small juveniles had statistically detectable effects on numbers of larvae. However, plant damage was reduced in the presence of large juvenile A. aperta, suggesting that A. aperta may also have non-consumptive effects on the feeding behavior of E. postvittana larvae. Anyphaena aperta consumed larvae only when larval densities exceeded a low threshold in a functional response experiment, leading to a type III functional response. Adult A. aperta showed no preference for different E. postvittana instars, whereas Cheiracanthium mildei L. Koch (Miturgidae), an abundant hunting spider on French broom, showed a partial preference for late-instar larvae. The generalist feeding habits of the spiders may have precluded strong prey preferences. Results show that hunting spiders may help limit E. postvittana populations in California, and that they may in turn reduce the impact of E. postvittana on its host plants.
