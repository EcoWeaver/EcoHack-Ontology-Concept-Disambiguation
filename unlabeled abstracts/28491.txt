Newly invading species exploiting native host-plants: the case of the AfricanZaprionus indianus(Gupta) in the Brazilian Cerrado (Diptera, Drosophilidae)
The African Zaprionus indianus (Diptera, Drosophilidae) was introduced into the Neotropical Region by the end of the 1990's, and it became abundant in several types of altered and natural environments. In the Cerrado, the second South American biome in extension, it has been found mainly in open vegetation and during the rainy season. In the current work, we showed that Z. indianus utilizes a major native fruit of the Brazilian Cerrado (Solanum lycocarpum) primarily, all over the fructification period and states of fruit's decay, confirming the adaptative versatility of this invading fly in new environments.
