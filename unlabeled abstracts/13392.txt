A multi-scale approach to identify invasion drivers and invaders' future dynamics
Climate, land use and disturbances are well known drivers of invasion. However, their relative influence may change across spatial scales, where climate is expected to be the main filter at broad scales; land use is expected to have more influence at intermediate scales, and disturbance, at fine ones. Understanding the underlying processes that drive invasion patterns at different spatial scales is thus crucial to be able to anticipate the future spread of invaders. Here, we quantified the relative importance of climate, land use, and disturbance on the distribution of the invasive trees Ailanthus altissima and Robinia pseudoacacia, across three nested spatial scales, namely global, country (Spain) and riverbank (three riparian riverbanks). To do so, for each species and scale, we built ensemble species distribution models. We also identified their range filling and inferred the most suitable areas in Spain for them to spread. In general, our study confirms that climate acts as an initial coarse filter of species distribution, whilst both climate and land use were important at the country scale; at the riverbank scale human-mediated disturbances gained importance. However, R. pseudoacacia and A. altissima showed differences in their degree of range filling, where A. altissima has a higher potential for range expansion in the near future. Overall, the integration of different scales into invasion studies shows a great potential to enrich our understanding of species-habitat relationships, and to help anticipate their future dynamics.
