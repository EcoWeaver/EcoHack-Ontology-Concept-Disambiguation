Lockdown policy effects on invasive species: a perspective
Changes in human activities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can have multiple effects on biodiversity but there is limited knowledge of how this can impact invasive alien species (IAS). Societal measures against the spread of COVID-19 can have both short-term and long-term consequences on IAS. In the short-term, reduced human disturbance on natural habitats can increase the activity of IAS and accelerate their spread. Furthermore, management agencies have reduced control activities, sometimes allowing IAS to thrive, and ongoing monitoring programs have been interrupted, hindering rapid identification and management of biological invasions. Long-term impacts could include global modifications to wildlife trade and increased releases of captive-bred species because of the fear of zoonotic diseases and also greater public awareness of the risks of pathogens being spread among animal populations. Long-term collection and sharing of data are crucial to modulate IAS management during and after the lockdowns.
