Competitive interactions between native and exotic salmonids: a combined field and laboratory demonstration
Abstract -  We studied the impact of two exotic salmonid species (brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) on native brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) habitat, growth and survival. Habitat selection and vertical distribution between young-of-the-year of the three species were examined in a stream aquarium under different sympatric and allopatric combinations. In addition, similar species combinations were introduced in a Pyrenean mountain stream (southwest France) in order to extend laboratory results to growth and apparent survival. Both laboratory and field results indicated that rainbow trout significantly affected native brown trout habitat selection and apparent survival. On the contrary, brown trout habitat, growth and apparent survival were hardly affected by brook trout. These results support the idea that rainbow trout negatively influence native brown trout, and that competition could influence the outcome of fish biological invasions in freshwater ecosystems.
