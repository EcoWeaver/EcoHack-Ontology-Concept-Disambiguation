Genetic variability of the invasive snail Pomacea canaliculata in South China based on mitochondrial 16S rDNA sequences
*Species prevalence of Pomacea spp. from 19 regions in South China was identified.*Low genetic variation was not related to geographic distribution patterns of Pomacea canaliculata.*Two haplotypes as the ancestral continental haplotypes of P. canaliculata were found.*Phylogenetic analysis indicated the success invasion of P. canaliculata through secondary introductions in South China.
