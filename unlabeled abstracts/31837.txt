Selection on tropane alkaloids in native and non-native populations of Datura stramonium
Theories of plant invasion based on enemy release in a new range assume that selection exerted by specialist herbivores on defence traits should be reduced, absent, or even selected against in the new environment. Here, we measured phenotypic selection on atropine and scopolamine concentration of Datura stramonium in eight native (Mexico) and 14 non-native (Spain) populations. Native populations produced between 20 and 40 times more alkaloid than non-native populations (atropine: 2.0171 vs. 0.0458 mg/g; scopolamine: 1.004 vs. 0.0488 mg/g, respectively). Selection on alkaloids was negative for atropine and positive for scopolamine concentration in both ranges. However, the effect sizes of selection gradients were only significant in the native range. Our results support the assumption that the reduction of plant defence in the absence of the plant's natural enemies in invasive ranges is driven by natural selection. Here, we measured phenotypic selection on two chemical defense against herbivores (atropine and scopolamine) in native (Mexico) and non-native (Spain) populations of Datura stramonium. Our results support the assumption that the reduction in plant defense in the absence of the plant's natural enemies in invasive ranges is driven by natural selection.
