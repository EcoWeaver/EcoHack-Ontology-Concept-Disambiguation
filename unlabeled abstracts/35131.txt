Ecological consequences of invasion of Phyllonorycter issikii (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae) in lime forests in Udmurtia
The influence of the lime miner, Phyllonorycter issikii, on the productivity and reproductive parameters of the small-leaved lime Tilia cordata was studied. An increasing infestation of the host plant had a significant negative effect on the linear growth of the shoots and the radial increment of the trunk, the formation of annual rings, the number of inflorescences, and sugar content in the nectar. The latter factor may create a direct threat to the efficiency of local beekeeping. It is recommended that the lime miner be included into the list of domestic quarantine objects of the Russian Federation, and that the population state of this pest be monitored.
