Bio-invasive ascidians in Ireland: A threat for the shellfish industry but also a source of high added value products
In October 2016, a rapid assessment survey of ascidian species was conducted in shellfish farms at Killary Fjord, in the west of Ireland. Two non-indigenous solitary ascidians Ascidiella aspersa and Corella eumoyta were recorded for the first time in shellfish farms at this location. Both invasive ascidians have the potential to greatly reduce mussel production in Killary Fjord by competing with shellfish for food and habitat. Their high abundance also causes an increase in maintenance costs leading to economic losses for aquaculture farmers. Prompted by our finding of two invasive ascidians in Killary Fjord, we provide a brief review of the ecological role of ascidians and the potential of harnessing biomass from such invasive species for the production of high added value marine natural products.
