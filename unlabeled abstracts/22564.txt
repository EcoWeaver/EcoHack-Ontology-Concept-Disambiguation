Zooplankton composition in Lake Varano (Adriatic Sea coast, Italy)
The zooplankton composition of Lake Varano has been studied from June 2007 to May 2008 considering three sampling stations (western, central, eastern). A total of 55 zooplankton categories were recognised, with medusae Aurelia aurita as the main macroscopic species; 43 of them occurred in less than 50% of the 71 samples collected, highlighting the seasonal aspect of the community. The remaining 12 categories, present in more than 50% of samples, were numerically dominated by the copepod 'Non Indigenous Species' Acartia tonsa (reported here for the first time in the lake), which occurred throughout the year. Maximal abundance of zooplankton was recorded in the eastern sampling station, while the lowest values were recorded in the central one. The statistical analysis of data allowed us to establish a not sharp separation of the three sampling stations, apart from isolated dates. The present zooplankton assemblage showed that about 40% of its components differed from those recorded in a study of 18 years before. This last comparison is not easily referable to the ongoing climate warming (the dominant species are of cold temperate origin) and analysis of uninterrupted time series could be useful to understand the underlying reasons.
