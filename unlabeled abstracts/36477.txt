Records of Invasive European Catfish Silurus Glanis (Linnaeus, 1758) in the Neretva River Delta (Croatia): Social Media as Information Source
Abstract Records of European catfish Silurus glanis in the Neretva River delta (Adriatic Sea basin) in Croatia are reported. The first occurrence of this non-native species was reported via social network which led to its timely detection by researchers. Origin of introduction is unknown but it is most likely the case of human-mediated introduction. The importance of social networks as a useful tool for the timely detection of non-native fish species, as well as the importance of raising awareness about the impacts of biological invasions, is discussed in this paper.
