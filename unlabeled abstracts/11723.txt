Urban Wetland Characterization in South-Central New York State
Urban wetlands can serve to reduce flooding and improve water quality, yet we know little about their plant communities. Our study aims to characterize the vegetation and soil parameters of these important ecosystems, and to compare these features to those of previously sampled natural wetlands in south-central New York. Vegetation and soil characteristics were sampled in eight urban wetlands and compared to six forested wetlands, five scrub-shrub wetlands, and seven emergent wetlands. Urban sites had significantly lower species richness and a higher percent cover of invasives, including Typha x glauca, Phalaris arundinacea, and Lythrum salicaria. However, non-invasive species were also common in urban flora, including Leersia oryzoides, Ludwigia palustris, and Sagittaria latifolia. Urban wetlands had a high percentage of obligate wetland species, and most closely resembled emergent wetlands in their vegetation composition. Soil pH and soil electrical conductivity were significantly higher in urban sites, but potential net N-mineralization rates were significantly lower. Urban wetland vegetation and soil characteristics are different than those in nearby natural wetlands, and our increased knowledge of these urban ecosystems will lead to more successful restoration and creation projects.
