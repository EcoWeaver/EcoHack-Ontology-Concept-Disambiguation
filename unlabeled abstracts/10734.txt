Physiological, morphological and behavioural adaptation to a sodium deficient environment by wild native Australian and introduced species of animals
"DESCRIBES AN ATTEMPT TO ANALYSE COMPREHENSIVELY THE SPECTRUM OF ADAPTATIONS BY BOTH NATIVE AUSTRALIAN AND INTRODUCED SPECIES OF ANIMALS TO ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS INVOLVING SEVERE SODIUM DEFICIENCY. . . . A PRINCIPAL AIM WAS TO EVALUATE SALT APPETITE IN RELATION TO THE VERIFIED SODIUM STATUS OF THE ANIMALS AS REFLECTED BY SODIUM EXCRETION, AND ALSO THE HORMONE SECRETORY PROCESSES WHICH ARE CONCERNED WITH SODIUM BALANCE." MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES WERE ALSO FOUND. SS INCLUDED WILD RABBITS, KANGAROOS, WOMBATS, AND SHEEP. IT WAS FOUND THAT EFFECTS OF SODIUM DEFICIENCY WERE "AGGRAVATED BY PREGNANCY AND LACTATION, . . ." AND THAT "MECHANISMS CONTROLLING SODIUM HOMEOSTASIS IN WILD RABBITS ARE SUBJECT TO PROFOUND STRESS." DATA SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS "THAT THE LABORATORY DEMONSTRATION OF A LARGE REDUCTION IN THE RATIO OF SODIUM TO POTASSIUM IN THE SALIVA OF SODIUM DEFICIENT RUMINANTS MEDIATED BY ALDOSTERONE REFLECTS A PRINCIPAL MECHANISM IN EVOLUTIONARY EMERGENCE OF THE CAPACITY OF THESE ANIMALS TO ADAPT TO STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS."
