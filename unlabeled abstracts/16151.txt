Preliminary estimates of consumption rates of Rapana venosa (Gastropoda, Muricidae); a new threat to mollusk biodiversity in the Rio de la Plata
The veined whelk Rapana venosa (Valenciennes, 1846) is an active, Asian, invasive mollusk predator that has been present along the coastal zone of Maldonado, Uruguay since 2004. The feeding rate of R. venosa on native mussels was estimated in a laboratory experiment. A flume with a constant water flow was used, in which the mean (+/- SD) temperature was 25.4 +/- 1.8 degrees C, the mean (+/- SD) salinity was 18.5 +/- 1.6, and a 15:9 light-dark schedule was followed. Each experimental trial lasted 9 days and a constant prey supply was maintained. Three size classes of predators and three size classes of prey (Brachidontes rodriguezii and Mytella charruana), were used. For all sizes of predator combined, the average (+/- SD) absolute consumption rate was 0.88 +/- 0.3 g day(-1), and the relative consumption rate was 0.057 +/- 0.034 g g(-1) day(-1). No significant differences were found between the number of prey and total grams consumed among the three size categories of snails. However, for the relative consumption rate, small snails consumed significantly greater (0.10 g g(-1) day(-1)) amounts than intermediate and large snails (0.04 and 0.02 g g(-1) day(-1) respectively). All sizes of snails consumed significantly more intermediate-than small-sized mussels. This study provides important knowledge for future research to assess the impact of this invasive species on native bivalve resources.
