Consumption, survival and growth in the invasive freshwater snail Pomacea canaliculata: does food freshness matter?
Understanding factors that determine the fitness of invasive species may help us predict their spread and impact. Previous studies of the survival, growth and reproduction of Pomacea canaliculata, a freshwater apple snail native to South America now widely spread in Asia, North America and Hawaii, have emphasized the use of fresh leaves as food. We compared the consumption and growth of P. canaliculata reared on fresh and decaying leaves of three species of macrophytes with contrasting content of phenolics (general plant defence chemicals) and nutrients. We conducted 1-day consumption assays using adult snails and a 1-month survival and growth experiment using snails of various sizes. Our results showed that the consumption, survival and growth of P. canaliculata were determined by plant nutrients and phenolics, rather than plant freshness. For Murdannia nudiflora, a species with low phenolic content, fresh leaves with high nitrogen content were more palatable and valuable for growth than decaying leaves
