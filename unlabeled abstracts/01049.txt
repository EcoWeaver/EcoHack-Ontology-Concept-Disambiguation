Morphological variability of the Asiatic cyprinid, topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva, in its introduced European range
To assess the spatial variability in external morphology of non-native populations of topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva within an ontogenetic context, triple regression analysis (distance-based measurements) was applied to data from eight European populations (two Slovak, four Romanian, one English and one French). The data from Slovakia were also subjected to geometrical analysis (co-ordinates-based measurements) to obtain a more complex picture of the species' overall morphology. Great phenotypic variability was observed, being expressed not only in the formation of different definite phenotypes but also in the manner by which the phenotypes are achieved. Thus, both the definite phenotype and the patterns of development in invasive P. parva may be highly influenced by environmental conditions. Such great morphological (phenotypic) variability is likely to be one of the attributes that make this species such a successful invader.
