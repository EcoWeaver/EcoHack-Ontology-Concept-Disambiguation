Growth and feeding habits of invasive Pseudorasbora parva in the Chabalang Wetland (Lhasa, China) and its trophic impacts on native fish
In recent years, fish invasion has become one of the main reasons for the decline of native fish stocks. Pseudorasbora parva is considered one of the major invasive species worldwide. The present study investigated the fish resources of the Chabalang Wetland (Lhasa, Tibet) during different seasons in 2009 and 2013. Four hundred and twelve individuals were subsampled to estimate age, growth, and feeding habit of P. parva. Furthermore, food relationships between P. parva and the native Schizothoracinae fish were also examined. The results revealed a significant shift in species composition and community structure characterized by the disappearance of native fish and outbreak of non-native fish. The percentage of nonnative P. parva in the fish collections significantly increased from 33.64% in 2009 to 64.08% in 2013. The standard length (SL) ranged from 22.00 to 78.71 mm, and their age was 1-5 yr. The von Bertalanffy function was used to model the observed length-at-age data as Lt =112.19(1-e-0.1495 ( t +0.8012) ) for females and as Lt =123.12 (1-e-0.1500 ( t +0.7132) ) for males. The results indicated that P. parva in Tibet has lower growth and mortality rates compared with that from the native ranges. Ninety-seven prey taxa belonging to 9 prey categories were identified in the gut of 38 P. parva. P. parva can be considered a generalized and opportunistic predator, competing with the native fish, especially Schizothorax o'connori, Schizopygopsis younghusbandi younghusbandi, and Ptychobarbus dipogon, for Bacillariophyta and Chironomid larvae. This is an important reason for the decline in native fish population.
