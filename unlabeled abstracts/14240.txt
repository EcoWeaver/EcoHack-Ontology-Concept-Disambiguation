Condition of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) overstory and regeneration at three stages of the emerald ash borer invasion wave
Assessing emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) impacts in North American forests is essential for projecting future species composition of stands invaded by this phloem-feeding pest. We surveyed all species of overstory trees and regeneration in 2010 and 2011 in 24 forested sites with a major component of green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), representing the Core, Crest, and Cusp of the A. planipennis invasion wave across southern Michigan. By 2011, an average of 78.6% +- 0.10%, 44.8% +- 0.11%, and 19.8% +- 0.07% of overstory ash trees representing 87%, 57%, and 14% of the total ash basal area had been killed in Core, Crest, and Cusp sites, respectively. Green ash seedlings, saplings, and recruits were abundant in all sites, but newly germinated ash seedlings were absent in Core sites and scarce in Crest sites. Canopy gaps resulting from current ash decline and mortality increased available photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and sapling growth in Crest sites, but PAR was low in Core and Cusp sites. Lateral ingrowth of non-ash overstory trees has largely filled canopy gaps in Core sites, and there was little evidence of green ash recruitment into the overstory. Green ash appears unlikely to persist as a dominant species in forests invaded by A. planipennis.
