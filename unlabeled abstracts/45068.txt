Acid deposition at higher acidity weakens the antagonistic responses during the co-decomposition of two Asteraceae invasive plants
Co-invasion by two invasive plant species (IPS) can occur in the same habitat. Diversified acid deposition may change the co-invasion process by altering litter decomposition and plant-soil feedback signalling. This study examined the co-decomposition of two Asteraceae IPS (Solidago canadensis L. and Bidens pilosa L.) on litter decomposition rate, soil enzyme activities, and soil N-fixing bacterial communities under diversified acid deposition (mixed acid deposition at pH 5.6 and at pH 4.5, sulfuric acid at pH 4.5, and nitric acid at pH 4.5). B. pilosa litter degraded faster than S. canadensis litter. Acid deposition at higher acidity accelerated the decomposition rate of both pure S. canadensis litter and the equally mixed litters from the two Asteraceae IPS. Antagonistic responses may occur during the co-decomposition of the two Asteraceae IPS with mixed acid deposition, regardless of the pH, as well as with nitric acid deposition at pH 4.5; in contrast, there may be neutral responses for the co-decomposition process with sulfuric acid at pH 4.5. The type of acid deposited may be one of the key factors affecting the intensity of the mixing effect affecting the co-decomposition. Acid deposition at higher acidity weakened the antagonistic responses for the co-decomposition of the two Asteraceae IPS compared with the response to weak acids. Together, these results indicate that acid deposition at higher acidity could facilitate the co-invasion of the two Asteraceae IPS mainly through accelerated litter decomposition as well as weakened antagonistic responses for co-decomposition.
