Effective thermoregulation in a newly established population of Podarcis siculus in Greece: a possible advantage for a successful invader
Temperature affects all aspects of reptilian biology. In order to colonize new habitats and support viable populations lizards have to successfully deal with their thermal environment. Podarcis siculus is a notorious example of a successful colonizer that has invaded numerous habitats outside its natural distribution range. Though certain features of its thermal biology have been assessed so far, the thermoregulatory abilities of the species remain poorly described. Here we investigated a recently discovered population in Greece and evaluated the effectiveness of ther-moregulation measuring three main thermal parameters: set-point range, operative and field body temperatures. The Greek P. siculus appear to be accurate, precise and effective thermoregulators achieving E = 0.96. This effective ther-moregulation may be used to explain, among other special characteristics, its spreading success.
