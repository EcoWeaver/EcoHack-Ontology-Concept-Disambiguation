Competition, Resource Use and Habitat Selection in Two Introduced Hawaiian Mannikins
We analyzed patterns in geographic distribution and resource use for two species of introduced mannikins (Aves: Estrildidae) in four urban parks across southern Oahu, Hawaii. Both species fed exclusively on grass seeds. Resource levels (i.e., the density of grass stems) cycled continuously in the parks due to alternating management practices (i.e., watering and mowing). Both species were common in urban parks during summer months but not during winter. During summer, both species increased significantly as resource levels increased. Nutmeg Mannikins (Lonchura punctulata) occurred in all parks but were rare in those parks where Chestnut Mannikins (Lonchura malacca) were common. This was true even when resource levels between parks did not differ significantly. We interpreted this as evidence for competition between these species. We also tested two specific predictions of the shared-preference model of density-dependent habitat selection. According to this model both species should occur together in a park only when the density of grass seeds in that park is high. A second prediction of the model is that at low resource levels only one species (i.e., the behaviorally dominant species) should occur. Both of these predictions failed. We observed both species together in parks only rarely, and in some cases of coexistence resource levels were quite low Each species was seen by itself in at least one park.
