Reproductive load modulates drought stress response but does not compromise recovery in an invasive plant during the Mediterranean summer
Despite summer drought may challenge plant survival in Mediterranean-type ecosystems, the role of reproductive load on drought stress and recovery has been poorly studied in invasive plants, most particularly under natural field conditions. In this study, a highly plastic clonal invasive species, Carpobrotus edulis was used to explore a putative differential response to drought between reproductive (senescent) ramets and non-reproductive ramets. Furthermore, fruit removal was used to assess how alterations on the source-sink dynamics influence plant performance during drought stress and recovery. We examined the variations in chloroplast pigments, antioxidants, lipid peroxidation and cytokinins in leaves of non-reproductive and reproductive ramets (either with intact or fruit-removed ramets) in response to summer drought stress and recovery after rains under Mediterranean field conditions. Results showed that although both ramet types within a C. edulis patch recovered at the end of the summer, increased photoprotective investment was found in leaves from reproductive ramets, thus indicating an increased photoprotective demand associated with reproduction at the ramet level. This response was associated with higher cytokinin contents in leaves of reproductive ramets compared to those of non-reproductive. Although leaf senescence was not reversed by the fruit removal, leaves recovered their chlorophyll content after rainfall during late summer in parallel with the accumulation of cytokinins. In conclusion, C. edulis shows a huge plasticity in drought stress responses with a marked compartmentation at the ramet level, which helps at least in part to an efficient recovery from unpredictable water shortage periods in the current frame of climate change.
