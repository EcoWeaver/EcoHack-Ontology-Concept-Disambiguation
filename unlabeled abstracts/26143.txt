Effects of the Invasive Forb Centaurea maculosa on grassland Carbon and Nitrogen Pools in Montana, USA
Invasions by exotic forbs are changing large areas of North American grasslands, but their biogeochemical impacts are not well characterized. Additionally, although many invasive plants may alter biogeochemistry, an invasive species effects have rarely been evaluated across physically diverse sites. We sampled nine sites containing the perennial Eurasian forb Centaurea maculosa to determine if this invasive species alters soil C and N pools in native grasslands in Montana, USA. We sampled surface soil in adjacent microsites with C. maculosa and native grasses and analyzed soil C and N pools with slow to rapid turnover. None of the pools evaluated in the laboratory showed significant differences between C. maculosa and grass microsites when analyzed across all sites. Some differences were found at individual sites, but they were infrequent and inconsistent: Four sites had no differences, four had differences in one or two pools with intermediate (particulate organic matter C or N) or rapid turnover rates (potentially mineralizable N), and just one site had differences encompassing pools with rapid, intermediate, and slow (total C and N, silt-and-clay-associated N) turnover rates. Where they differed, pools were usually smaller under C. maculosa plants than under native grasses, but the opposite was found at one site. In situ N availability, estimated using ion exchange resins, was significantly lower under C. maculosa than under grasses at one of three sites sampled. Results indicate that C. maculosa may sometimes reduce soil C and N pools, including those related to N availability, but they argue against generalizing about the impacts of C. maculosa in grasslands.
