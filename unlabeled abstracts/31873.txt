Acclimation of Respiratory O2 Uptake in Green Tissues of Field-Grown Native Species after Long-Term Exposure to Elevated Atmospheric CO2
C3 and C4 plants were grown in open-top chambers in the field at two CO2 concentrations, normal ambient (ambient) and normal ambient + 340 [mu]LL-1 (elevated). Dark oxygen uptake was measured in leaves and stems using a liquid-phase Clark-type oxygen electrode. High CO2 treatment decreased dark oxygen uptake in stems of Scirpus olneyi (C3) and leaves of Lindera benzoin (C3) expressed on either a dry weight or area basis. Respiration of Spartina patens (C4) leaves was unaffected by CO2 treatment. Leaf dry weight per unit area was unchanged by CO2, but respiration per unit of carbon or per unit of nitrogen was decreased in the C3 species grown at high CO2. The component of respiration in stems of S. olneyi and leaves of L. benzoin primarily affected by long-term exposure to the elevated CO2 treatment was the activity of the cytochrome pathway. Elevated CO2 had no effect on activity and capacity of the alternative pathway in S. olneyi. The cytochrome c oxidase activity, assayed in a cell-free extract, was strongly decreased by growth at high CO2 in stems of S. olneyi but it was unaffected in S. patens leaves. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase and complex III extracted from mature leaves of L. benzoin was also decreased after one growing season of plant exposure to elevated CO2 concentration. These results show that in some C3 species respiration will be reduced when plants are grown in elevated atmospheric CO2. The possible physiological causes and implications of these effects are discussed.
