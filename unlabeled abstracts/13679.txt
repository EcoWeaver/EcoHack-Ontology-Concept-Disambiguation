Hybrid Typhaxglauca outperforms native T. latifolia under contrasting water depths in a common garden
Hybridization can result in the formation of highly competitive lineages that displace their progenitor species and other native organisms. In eastern North America, hybridization between native Typha latifolia and introduced Typha angustifolia yields the vigorous hybrid species T. x glauca. The hybrid has become increasingly prevalent over the past century in eastern North America, where there are indications it displaces native plants. Moreover, it has been suggested that water depth influences the growth performance of hybrid vs. native cattails but there have been no comparisons of plant performance under contrasting water depths. Using a common-garden experiment with two levels of a water-depth treatment we compared the above- and below-ground growth performance of T. latifolia vs. hybrid cattails collected from 12 sites in southern Ontario. We found that hybrids outperformed all other plants in terms of total and above-ground biomass production and, depending on the method of species assignment used, in terms of the number of ramets produced. However, there was no difference in the mass of rhizomes produced between species. Consistent with a previous study of natural populations from the same region, growth performance of the different species was similar across the different water depths used in the experiment. Collectively, our results indicate that enhanced hybrid performance was driven by the production of larger and more numerous ramets and not via increased investment in rhizomes.
