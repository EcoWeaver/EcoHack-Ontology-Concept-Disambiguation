Ichthyofauna of the upper Tom' affected by thermal pollution (West Siberia)
The paper gives comparative analysis of the species composition of fish in the upper Tom' from the zone of discharge of warm water of electrical power station and background parts of the riverbed. The areas subjected to thermal pollution feature an increase in the number and biomass of introduced species: the share of invaders makes up 19% of the total ichthyomass, 41% of the total number, and 25% of the species diversity of fish. Fish productivity of the mountain taiga part of the upper Tom' with the increased water temperature exceeds this value of the main riverbed 2-4 times and correlates with the level of productivity of the plain rivers in the south of West Siberia, which is related to eutrophication.
