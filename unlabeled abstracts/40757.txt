Wild masu salmon is outcompeted by hatchery masu salmon, a native invader, rather than brown trout, a nonnative invader
Artificially grown native species are released into natural environments to increase biological resources or to recover threatened populations. Such stocks typically have enhanced survivability and may outcompete wild conspecifics as so-called native invaders. In addition, it is likely that the competitive effects of native invaders on native species are more intense than those of nonnative invaders. To test these hypotheses, an enclosure experiment was conducted using young-of-the-year wild and hatchery (normally grown to a relatively large size to increase survival after stocking) native masu salmon, Oncorhynchus masou, and nonnative brown trout, Salmo trutta (which attain a smaller size than masu salmon). Competitive effects between these fishes were evaluated in terms of stomach fullness and specific growth rate of the wild masu salmon. The magnitude of the relationship between stomach fullness and growth between the experimental treatments revealed a similar pattern, suggesting that competition for foraging habitat most affected their growth. Wild masu salmon were negatively affected by hatchery conspecifics, and the effects were greater than those caused by brown trout. We propose that these outcomes were caused by competitive dominance as a consequence of body size differences. In conclusion, the results support the hypothesis that size-enhanced hatchery masu salmon have the potential to function as native invaders, and the negative effects of artificial stocks on wild masu salmon could be greater than those caused by a nonnative invader.
