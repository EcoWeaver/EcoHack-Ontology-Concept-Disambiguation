Turning off the Tap: A Strategy to Address International Aspects of Invasive Alien Species
Invasions by plants, animals and pathogens into non-native environments pose one of the most significant, but least addressed, international threats to biodiversity, human health, livelihoods, local cultures and national economies. When invasive alien species (IAS) establish and spread, their impact can be irreversible. Developing a system to confront these risks and reduce associated costs is one of the most significant environmental challenges now facing the international community. This article reviews five key international issues relating to the creation of a regime to control the spread of IAS. The issues that are examined are: (1) preventing the introduction of IAS; (2) building capacities to prevent future introductions; (3) addressing responsibility and establishing accountability among private actors; (4) addressing international liability and providing redress for the harm caused by IAS; and (5) facilitating cooperation and coordination among States. Each of these challenges will be examined and strategies to address them will be analysed.
