Biological invasion and parasitism: invaders do not suffer from physiological alterations of the acanthocephalanPomphorhynchus laevis
SUMMARYBiological invasions expose parasites to new invasive hosts in addition to their local hosts. However, local parasites are often less successful in infecting and exploiting their new hosts. This may have major consequences for the competitive ability of hosts, and finally on the fate of the parasite-host community. In Burgundy (Eastern France), the acanthocephalan parasite,Pomphorhynchus laevis, infects 2 amphipod species living in sympatry: the nativeGammarus pulexand the invasiveGammarus roeseli. WhileP. laevisaffects the behaviour and the immunity ofG. pulex,G. roeseliseems unaffected by the infection. In this study, we examined in detail the ability of the parasite to affect the immune system and resource storage of both gammarid species. We found that the infection was associated with a general decrease of the prophenoloxidase activity, haemocyte density, resistance to an artificial bacterial infection and level of sugar reserves inG. pulex, but not inG. roeseli. These results demonstrate a differential ability ofP. laevisto exploit its local and its invasive gammarid hosts. Potential mechanisms of these differential physiological alterations and their potential consequences on the coexistence of both gammarid species in sympatry are discussed.
