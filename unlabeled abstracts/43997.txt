First record of the cryptic invader Pyrgophorus platyrachis Thompson, 1968 (Gastropoda: Truncatelloidea: Cochliopidae) outside the Americas
Anthropogenic removal of natural dispersal barriers and modification of natural habitats have contributed to the spread of non-native species. Potential invaders that are cryptic in appearance and/or behaviour are particularly troublesome as this confounds efforts to detect or manage incipient invasions. Here we report one such invader, the Florida serrate crownsnail, Pyrgophorus platyrachis Thompson, 1968, in Singapore reservoirs--only the first record outside the Americas. We identified P. platyrachis using morphological and molecular techniques. The Singapore COI mitochondrial sequences were 99-100% matched to P. platyrachis from Florida, USA, while the 16S sequences are the first published for this species, and were most closely matched to another confamilial species.
