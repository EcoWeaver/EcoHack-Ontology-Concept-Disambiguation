Japanese Chaff-flower, Achyranthes japonica (Amaranthaceae), on the Erie islands, an invasive plant new to Canada
Japanese Chaff-flower, Achyranthes japonica (Miquel) Nakai (Amaranthaceae) was found growing on two islands in western Lake Erie: East Sister Island and Middle Island. These are the first documented reports for this species in Canada, and these locations are approximately 300 km north of the nearest reported observations in southern Ohio. Japanese Chaff-flower is a non-native plant from Asia, which is highly invasive in the United States and has the potential to become so in Canada.
