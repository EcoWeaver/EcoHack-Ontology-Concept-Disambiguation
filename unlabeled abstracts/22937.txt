Isolation and characterization of nine polymorphic microsatellite loci in the northern crayfish (Orconectes virilis)
Nine novel polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated from Orconectes virilis and characterized in 46 individuals from two major rivers in Alberta, Canada. Number of alleles per locus per site ranged from 1 to 5. Observed and expected heterozygosity per site ranged from 0.000 to 0.900 and 0.000 to 0.740, respectively. All nine microsatellite loci conformed to expectations of Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium. These markers will be useful in the study of movement patterns, genetic diversity, and population structure of native and invading O. virilis.
