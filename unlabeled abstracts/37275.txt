LIPARTHRUM COLCHICUMSEMENOV (COLEOPTERA CURCULIONIDAE SCOLYTINAE) IN ITALY: INTRODUCED, ESTABLISHED OR NATIVE SPECIES?
Liparthrum colchicumSemenov (Coleoptera Curculionidae Scolytinae) is a relatively unknown monophagous insect species primarily associated with thin dried twigs (about 0.5-1cm in diameter) of Laurel (Laurus nobilis). After being caught in traps located at Italian ports, it was initially considered an intercepted species alien to the country. However, recent findings, suggest that this beetle may have a different origin. Several records from different sites of Tuscany and Latium showed that it could be relatively widespread in Italy. These observations strengthened the hypothesis that this scolytid, harmless to L. nobilis, might be already established or even native to the country. Therefore, we argue that it could have been easily overlooked thus far, as it thrives only in twigs already wilted due to different environmental factors. Moreover, field observations, carried out in the two Italian Regions, evidenced high frequencies of its infestations in Laurel twigs previously colonized by Xylosandrus compactus. Notes on the taxonomy and biology of this species are also reported in the present wo
