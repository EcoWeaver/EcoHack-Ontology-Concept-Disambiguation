Seasonal changes in stream salmonid population densities in two tributaries of a boreal river in northern Japan
We examined seasonal changes in population densities of stream salmonids (masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou, white-spotted charr Salvelinus leucomaenis, and rainbow trout O. mykiss) in two tributaries of the Shoro River, eastern Hokkaido, Japan. In one small tributary, water temperature was relatively high during the winter, and populations of salmon and trout increased through immigration at this time of the year, becoming dominant components of the salmonid assemblage; the density of charr in this stream decreased during the winter, but charr was dominant during the summer. In another medium-sized tributary, the water temperature fell to close to 0degC during the winter, and densities of salmon and charr decreased in this season, through emigration; trout were very rare in this stream. Seasonal patterns of stream salmonid densities vary among species and between localities, resulting in seasonal changes in species composition. For a comprehensive understanding of population processes, a whole-river survey across seasons will be necessary. KeywordsOverwintering-Seasonality-Tributary-Movement-Exotic species
