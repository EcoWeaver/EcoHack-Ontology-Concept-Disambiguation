Genetic analysis of ID1-DBL2X predicts its validity as a vaccine candidate in Colombia and supports at least two independently introduced Plasmodium falciparum populations in the region
Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) poses a threat to both the mother and fetus, increasing the risk of severe maternal anemia, fetal growth restriction and low birth weight infants. Two vaccines are currently in development to protect women from Plasmodium falciparum in pregnancy. Both vaccine constructs target the ID1-DBL2Xb domain of VAR2CSA, a protein expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes (IEs) that mediates parasite sequestration in the placenta. Although development of an effective vaccine may be hampered by ID1-DBL2Xb polymorphisms expressed by field isolates, a recent study showed that genetic variation of this domain in South American parasite populations is much lower than in other geographical locations. This suggests that a recombinant vaccine designed to be efficacious in Africa and Asia is likely to be efficacious in South America. However, these studies did not include Colombian parasite populations in their analyses, which are known to be genetically distinct from other South American parasite populations due to their independent introduction from Africa. Therefore, we sought to determine the genetic variation of the ID1-DBL2X domain in Colombian parasites to assess the potential efficacy of the vaccine against PAM in this region. Through sequence analysis and population genetics, we show that there is a low degree of genetic variation amongst Colombian parasite populations and that a vaccine containing conserved antigen variants for worldwide populations is likely to be protective against PAM in Colombia. Our analysis also points towards an African origin for Colombian parasite populations, and suggests that their introduction into Colombia was a recurrent process encompassing multiple introduction events.
