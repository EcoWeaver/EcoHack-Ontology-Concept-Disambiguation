The impact of postglacial marine invasions on the genetic diversity of an obligate freshwater fish, the longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae), on the Quebec peninsula
Postglacial seas are expected to have had significant effects on the genetic structure of populations of obligate freshwater fishes. To assess this influence, mitochondrial DNA variability was evaluated in 32 populations of longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae) of the Quebec peninsula located within and outside of the maximum extent of marine invasions of the Champlain and Laflamme seas. Three clades of haplotypes diverging from one to two mutations were defined. Despite this low divergence, a clear and significant spatial genetic structure was observed outside of the extent of marine invasions. However, a higher genetic diversity was observed in populations located within the extent of marine invasions because of the admixture of these clades with an additional lineage restricted almost exclusively to those areas. The low genetic divergence between the main haplotypes suggests a single origin, despite the known presence of this species in various refuges. Marine invasions preventing entry to the peninsula, especially from Atlantic refuge, are proposed as a possible explanation to this particular result. This study is a relevant argument for integrating postglacial marine invasions into postglacial colonization models of freshwater species in the northeastern part of North America.
