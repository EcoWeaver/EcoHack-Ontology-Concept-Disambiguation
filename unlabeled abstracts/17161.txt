Cross-amplification of nonnativeAcaciaspecies in the Hawaiian Islands using microsatellite markers fromAcacia koa
Thirty-one microsatellite markers, developed from Acacia koa, were evaluated for cross-amplification of seven nonnative species of Acacia in the Hawaiian Islands. The number of alleles per locus ranged from one to seven, with 16 of the 31 markers showing polymorphism in at least two of the nonnative Acacia species. Of the Acacia species examined, A. melanoxylon showed the highest percentage of amplified loci.
