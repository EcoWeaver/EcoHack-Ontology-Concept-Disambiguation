First Record of Undaria Pinnatifida (Laminariales, Phaeophyta) in Southern Patagonia, Argentina
The Japanese kelp Undaria pinnatifida was found on 7th September 2005 in Ria Deseado (Santa Cruz, Argentina). This invasive algae was registered from the lower intertidal to the upper levels of the subtidal zone. The sporophytes were fixed to slabs, gravel and rocks of variable sizes and were also present as epibionts of tunicates. The sporophytes total length ranged between 3 and 88cm, with a mean of 28.75cm in the intertidal and 38.3cm in the subtidal. The density and biomass increased from the intertidal to the subtidal. The kelp population showed a higher number of small immature individuals in the intertidal thansubtidal where the organisms were bigger and with more individual biomass. This first record of U. pinnatifida in Southern Patagonia extends its southern distribution limit in Argentina, showing progressive expansion in the southwestern Atlantic. More surveys must be conducted to understand the evolution of U. pinnatifida invasion and its impact on the native benthic community.
