An introduced species helping another: dispersal of a rose seed infesting wasp by a marsupial in New Zealand
There is little field evidence of fruit-infesting insect species surviving passage through the digestive tract of frugivorous mammal species. In this study, we collected brushtail possum faecal pellets from the wild and demonstrated emergence of adult torymid wasps from Rosa seed without removing the seeds from the pellets. Nineteen percent of possum dung pellets were infested by adult wasps, and a large proportion (85 %) of wasps survived. Survival to emergence was high considering that gut passage time in possums averages 50 h. This period potentially allows greater dispersal distances of wasps than would occur naturally by their own means. This plant-insect-disperser triad was studied in New Zealand where all three species were introduced and did not co-evolve. An exaptation process might have occurred since introduction of these species 150-180 years ago.
