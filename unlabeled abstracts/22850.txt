Scale-dependent relationships between native richness, resource stability and exotic cover in dock fouling communities of Washington, USA
Aim In terrestrial plant communities, the relationship between native species diversity and exotic success is typically scale-dependent. It is often proposed that within local neighbourhoods, high native diversity limits resources, thereby inhibiting exotic success. However, environmental variation that manifests over space or time can create positive correlations between native diversity and exotic success at larger scales. In marine habitats, there have been few multi-scale surveys of this pattern, so it is unclear how diversity, resource limitation and the environment influence the success of exotic species in these systems.
