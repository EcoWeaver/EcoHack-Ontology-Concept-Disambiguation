Cattle in Hawai'i: Biological and Cultural Exchange
Capt. George Vancouver fifirst introduced cattle to the Hawaiian Islands in 1793, and the animals rapidly multiplied, roaming wild and causing environmental destruction for decades. In 1832 the Hawaiian monarch imported Mexican vaqueros to train Native Hawaiians in the skills necessary to manage and control the wild livestock, which led to the development of Hawaiian cowboys, known as paniolos, with a unique and locally celebrated cowboy culture that mixes Native Hawaiian elements with vaquero influences. This study of biotic and cultural exchange and native adaptation complicates and adds to our understanding of Hawai'i's place in the American West and the cultural factors that encourage and mediate biological invasions.
