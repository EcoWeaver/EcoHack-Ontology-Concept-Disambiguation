Population trends of invasive alien gobies in the upper Danube River: 10 years after first detection of the globally invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus)
Invasive alien species are a major threat to aquatic biodiversity. Europe's second largest river, the Danube, is affected by several invasions, including those by four closely related Ponto-Caspian goby species. To investigate population dynamics of invasive alien gobies, we surveyed population trends of all goby species, from absence until full establishment of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), along a 248 Km river section of the upper Danube River. Distribution and abundance of non-native gobies was highly species-specific and varied with both time (year) and space (location). Gobies strongly dominated the fish community along the entire sampled study area, comprising 76% of all caught individuals, whereas abundances of typical native species such as chub (5%), barbel (4%) and ide (3%) were low. Ten years after its first introduction, round goby is most successful in terms of abundance, tubenose goby is most successful in terms of range expansion and persistence, whereas bighead goby seemingly lost the race. While being decoupled from industrial shipping, goby invasion success strongly appears to be triggered by man-made ecosystem alterations and community changes. download: http://www.aquaticinvasions.net/2018/issue4.html
