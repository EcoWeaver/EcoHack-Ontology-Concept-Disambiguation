An expansion of the invasive species Amphibalanus subalbidus (Henry, 1973) in the south of Iraq
Aquatic ecosystems are under threat from nonindigenous species invasion. Fouling organisms on ship hulls are constantly in transit, posing a threat to recipient communities by reducing biodiversity and causing severe economic and public health impact. In the south of Iraq, a range expansion for the nonindigenous barnacle Amphibalanus subalbidus was recorded. On a West Asian scale, Shatt Al-Arab could be a hotspot for biological invasions in Iraq, since this river connects the Persian Gulf to inland waterbodies. Amphibalanus subalbidus could establish settlements in a variety of habitats due to its highly oligohaline distribution, which can withstand prolonged exposure to fresh water. Thus, a morphological consideration and their related distribution in the south of Iraq are discussed for this invasive species.
