Early invasion of common cordgrass (Spartina anglica) increases belowground biomass and decreases macrofaunal density and diversity in a tidal flat marsh
Spartina anglica (hereafter Spartina) is an invasive perennial marsh grass shifting hydrodynamic regime and sediment characteristics in invaded area, thereby reducing macrobenthic diversity. There have been only a few studies focusing on the patch structure of Spartina according to size and its effects on macrofauna. A field experiment was conducted to identify effects of Spartina patches where they have been introduced no later than 5 years after invasion occurred on macrofauna assemblages in Ganghwa Island, South Korea. The survey area was divided into two sections according to vegetation: (1) Suaeda japonica vegetation from 0 to 60 m away from the levee, and (2) bare mudflat from 60 to 90 m away from the levee. The patch sizes of Spartina were categorized into small (1-4 m2), medium (5-11 m2), and large (13-40 m2) in area with four replicates for each section. The biomass ratio of the belowground and aboveground in the small size patch of Spartina was significantly higher than those in the medium and large size patch of Spartina. It indicated that more resource was allocated to rhizomes in small size patch with short invasion history (1 ~ 2 years). After Spartina invaded, macrofauna richness (70%), Shannon-Wiener diversity (80%), and density (67%) were decreased. However, infaunal deposit-feeding polychaete Perinereis linea and epifaunal gastropods Batillaria cumingi and Lactiforis takii increased by Spartina. Ordination of macroinvertebrate assemblages separated the habitat with Spartina invasion from the adjacent uninvaded tidal flat and Suaeda japonica habitats. This study offers a significant insight into early invasion strategies of an aggressive plant invader, Spartina for management of coastal wetlands and its impacts on macrofaunal assemblages.
