Application of different soil conditioners to restorate mine tailings with native (Cistus ladanifer L.) and non-native species (Medicago sativa L.)
The present research aims to reclaim a mining area in the Riotinto district combining soil conditioners (composted sewage sludge, commercial fertilizer and lime) and two different plant species: Cistus ladanifer L. and Medicago sativa L. We employed several soil functional parameters (i.e. pH, organic carbon, microbial biomass, enzyme activities, soil respiration) and plant indicators (i.e. nutrients, bioaccumulation and transfer factor) to highlight their impact on soil properties and to evaluate the response of plants to the different growth media. Greater organic matter mineralization rates, and consequently higher respiration rates, were recorded in amended and limed soils in comparison with non-limed soils, and were attributed to a reactivation of copyotrophic populations as soil acidification decreased. Compost provided higher C availability and quality, which is partially reflected in a more efficient use of organic substrates (lower qCO2) by microbial biomass.
