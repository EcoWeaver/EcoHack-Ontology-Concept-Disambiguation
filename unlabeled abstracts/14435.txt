Long-term late season mowing maintains diversity in southern US tallgrass prairie invaded byBothriochloa ischaemum
While mowing is a viable management tool for the maintenance of diversity in grasslands, the suitability of mowing in grasslands with invasion by exotic plants is poorly understood. In this 18-yr study, we investigate the effects of long-term mowing on a tallgrass prairie community invaded by exotic yellow bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum; BOIS). We explore the influence of BOIS on species richness and composition in the face of different mowing treatments as well as monitoring any post-treatment legacy effects.
