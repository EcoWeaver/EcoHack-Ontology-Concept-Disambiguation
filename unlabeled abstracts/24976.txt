Predicting zebra mussel fouling on native mussels from physicochemical variables
1. Predictive models of impact are needed for the risk assessment of invasive species. One such species is the Eurasian zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), a fouling bivalve that overgrows and kills native mussels (Unionidae) in many North American lakes and rivers. The level of mortality in a native mussel population increases with the fouling intensity - i.e. the mean number of zebra mussels attached to each native mussel. 2. We conducted a multi-site survey within the St Lawrence and Richelieu rivers (Quebec, Canada) to determine whether zebra mussel fouling intensity can be predicted from environmental variables. We found fouling intensity to be positively correlated with calcium concentration [Ca2+] and negatively correlated with sediment size, but not affected by local macrophyte cover. 3. A multiple regression model that includes calcium concentration and sediment size explains 86% of variation in fouling intensity across all sites. 4. Analysis of data from invaded sites in North America and Europe revealed a nonlinear relationship in which fouling intensity increases with calcium concentration up to an asymptotic threshold of 24 mg L-1 Ca2+. 5. Our results suggest that the community-level impacts of zebra mussels are mediated by abiotic environmental variables and gradients in these variables may provide local habitat refugia for native mussels.
