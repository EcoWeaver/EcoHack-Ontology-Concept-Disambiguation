Contrasting effects of plant invasion on pollination of two native species with similar morphologies
Invasive plants may decrease native plant density and disrupt interactions between native plants and their pollinators. We hypothesized that invasive Solidago canadensis (Asteraceae) competes for pollination services with two confamilial species, Ixeris chinensis and Sonchus arvensis. Breeding-system studies revealed that both native species are self-incompatible. In plots with all three species we found that Solidago received the highest visitation rates. To test the hypothesis of competition for pollination in the context of reduced native density, we established 3 plots for both native species with three Solidago densities (uninvaded, 50 and 75 % invaded) and corresponding decreases in native density. We investigated the effects of varying densities of Solidago on honeybee visitation rates, number of successive visits within individual ramets, pollen-load composition on bees, and seed set. For both native species, increasing Solidago density and decreasing native density resulted in bees carrying higher ratios of Solidago pollen and in bees visiting fewer capitula prior to departing from a plant. However, for other aspects of pollination, the native species responded very differently to Solidago. With increasing Solidago and decreasing native density, Ixeris received fewer honeybee visits and produced fewer seeds, demonstrating competition for pollination, but Sonchus attracted more honeybee visits and showed a non-significant trend toward setting more seeds, suggesting facilitation. These opposing effects occurred despite similarities in the native species' floral morphology, suggesting that the effects of invasive plants are difficult to predict. In this case the different effects may relate to Sonchus being a taller plant with larger flowers.
