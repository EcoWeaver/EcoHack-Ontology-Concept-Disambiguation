Production and characterization of briquettes from invasive forest weeds: Lantana camara and Prosopis juliflora
Study on production of briquettes from two invasive forest weeds, i.e., Lantana camara and Prosopis juliflora was carried out. The experiments were carried out using a 90 mm industrial briquetting unit. The optimum moisture content for briquetting was found around 10-12%. L. camara and P. juliflora biomass briquettes were found to have high density (1.2 g cm-3) and high energy density (23.05 GJ m-3). In this study, fuel properties (calorific value, proximate and ultimate analysis), combustion characteristics and ash elemental composition of L. camara and P. juliflora biomass were investigated. Both the species are found to have less ash content. Further, high CaO content in ash (47-68%) gives added advantage to these species. In this study, we have also worked out the cost involved in briquetting. The emphasis was given to these species because of the huge biomass they produce. These species are widely present in different agro-climatic zones of India and can play a major role in future bioenergy schemes.
