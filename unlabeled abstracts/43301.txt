Invasive Alien Slug Arion vulgaris Moquin-Tandon, 1855 (Gastropoda: Pulmonata: Arionidae) in Moscow Parks and Its Co-introduced Parasite Alloionema appendiculatum Schneider, 1859
Purpose: The present study investigates the origin of Arion vulgaris slugs in the parks of Moscow city and their parasites. Methods: Snails and slugs inhabiting green areas of Moscow city were collected in the summer season of 2020 and examined on the presence of gastropod-associated nematodes and trematodes using morphological and molecular methods. Results: The presence of the alien slug species, Arion vulgaris, was recorded in several locations, and the mitochondrial gene-based analysis has shown that slug populations inhabited Moscow parks originated from West and Central Europe. Out of a total of 15 gastropod species examined, A. vulgaris was the only species infected by the nematode Alloionema appendiculatum Schneider, 1859, a larval parasite of molluscs. It is the first record of this nematode from the territory of the Russian Federation. COX1 mtDNA sequences of A. appendiculatum obtained from 3 populations of infected slugs were identical with those from Western and Central Europe similarly to their gastropod hosts thus indicating that the nematodes travelled with their hosts. No parasites dangerous for humans or animals were found. Conclusion: The complex life cycle of A. appendiculatum includes a free-living stage in soil which offers a source of infection for other potentially susceptible gastropod species but the capacity of A. appendiculatum to change hosts in local conditions needs to be further investigated. The particular susceptibility and tolerance of A. vulgaris to nematodes in our study was in concordance with earlier data while in contradiction with the enemy release hypothesis.
