Experimental evidence of the successful invader Orconectes limosus outcompeting the native Astacus leptodactylus in acquiring shelter and food
Successful invasive species compete for the same available resources with related native species, frequently driving the latter to the cusp of extirpation because of a lack of adaptive response. In this paper we analysed the behavioural relationships between two species of crayfish, the native Astacus leptodactylus and the invasive Orconectes limosus in an ongoing invasion process in the Lower Danube, in Eastern Europe. We tested the species' ability to acquire shelter and food in laboratory experiments in both intra-and interspecific confrontations. The dominant behaviour of the invasive species is obvious even towards its own congeners, while the native species display a more tolerant conspecific behaviour. With respect to interspecific confrontation, the invasive crayfish males and females were inclined to sex-specific dominance regarding shelters. A roughly balanced behaviour was noted for intersexual confrontations. The results of this study also highlight that the occupancy of a shelter is more disputed than food resources, which appear to be opportunistically acquired. In the context of the current invasion process, we hypothesised that the effect caused by interference competition might lead to a decline of the native species. Further investigations may reveal if there is any hope for recovery of the native species.
