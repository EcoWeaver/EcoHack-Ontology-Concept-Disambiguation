Evaluation of a Long-Term Predator Removal Program: Abundance and Population Dynamics of Invasive Northern Pike in the Yampa River, Colorado
The Northern Pike Esox lucius is invasive in the upper Green and Yampa River basins of Colorado and Utah and impedes endangered fish recovery in the upper Colorado River basin. Mechanical removal was implemented in 2004, but Northern Pike population dynamics and removal efficacy were not well understood. We analyzed mark?recapture records from 8,929 individual Northern Pike captured during 2004?2010 from three reaches of the Yampa River: Hayden to Craig (upstream reach), South Beach?Little Yampa Canyon?Juniper (middle reach), and Maybell?Sunbeam (downstream reach), encompassing 175 river kilometers. Annual survival rates for Northern Pike of the mean TL (465 mm) were highest downstream (mean = 0.54; range = 0.36?0.71) and lowest upstream (mean = 0.25; range = 0.12?0.38). Annual abundance exhibited the opposite pattern, as it was highest upstream (annual range = 1,144?4,078 fish) and lowest downstream (range = 232?746 fish). After removal occurred each year, Northern Pike abundance increased annually by nearly 1,000% in the upstream reach, over 875% in the middle reach, and over 375% in the downstream reach due to recruitment and immigration. Resulting densities were 4?58 times higher than those for a native apex predator, the endangered Colorado Pikeminnow Ptychocheilus lucius. Northern Pike movement was mostly (90%) downstream and sometimes extensive, which may have promoted establishment of additional populations. Removal rates were inadequate to reduce Northern Pike abundance in the Yampa River because recruitment and immigration exceeded removal and mortality. Investigation of reproduction and recruitment, along with source management, spawning disruption, and increased removal, are needed to further reduce Northern Pike abundance and to aid recovery of native and endangered fishes. These findings underscore the need for sustained, comprehensive, and often costly removal efforts?including evaluation of their effects?in the face of the expanding distribution and abundance of invasive predator species.
