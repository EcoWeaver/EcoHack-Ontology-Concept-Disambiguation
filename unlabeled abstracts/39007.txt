Invasive alien plant control improves foraging habitat quality of a threatened island flying fox
Flying foxes play keystone ecological roles in plant reproduction. Yet, they face numerous threats, including persecution for eating commercial fruits. This human-wildlife conflict has recently escalated to culling campaigns of a threatened flying fox on Mauritius. Finding non-lethal solutions to this human-wildlife conflict on the island is therefore extremely important. We hypothesized that invasive alien plants may reduce native fruit availability through competition and that weeding alien plants could improve the native foraging habitat quality of flying foxes - in turn, reducing their consumption of commercially important fruits. We compared native fruit production and foraging intensity of the Mauritian flying fox (Pteropus niger) in forests weeded of alien plants a decade previously and adjacent non-weeded forests. Fruits and ejecta were collected weekly during five months under 144 randomly chosen native trees of two canopy species whose fruits are eaten by flying foxes. Intraspecific variations in tree and fruit traits were used to examine flying fox foraging preference. Native fruit production was significantly higher in weeded forests for both tree species, and this was matched by higher flying fox foraging intensity. Flying foxes preferred large trees and fed predominantly on large and ripe fruits. The predominant consumption of ripe fruits emphasizes the importance of flying foxes as seed dispersers. Our results indicate that alien plant invasion substantially reduces native fruit production and that weeded forests provide a much better habitat for flying foxes. Our findings lend support to invasive alien plant control as a management strategy in mitigating such human-wildlife conflicts.
