Stable isotope niche convergence in coexisting native and non-native salmonids across age classes
Niche divergence resulting from coevolution is commonly believed to favour coexistence among competing species; however, recent investigations have demonstrated that an unexpected niche convergence can occur when native and non-native species coexist. Yet, our understanding of the ontogenetic characteristics of this niche convergence remains limited. In the present study, we quantified the stable isotope niche of native brown trout (Salmo trutta) in allopatry and sympatry with non-native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) across four age classes. Our results demonstrated that brown trout displayed a stable isotope niche closer to brook trout in sympatry than in allopatry, which was likely driven by an increased consumption of terrestrial invertebrates by sympatric brown trout. Stable isotope niche overlap was the strongest for young-of-the-year individuals and the intensity of overlap between sympatric native brown trout and non-native brook trout decreased during ontogeny. These findings indicate that niche convergence between the species occur at the earliest age class of the native species and are maintained across ontogeny.
