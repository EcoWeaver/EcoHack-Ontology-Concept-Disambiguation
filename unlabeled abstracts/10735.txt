Preface - The British contribution to the SCOPE Programme on the Ecology of Biological Invasions
SCOPE, the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment, analyses such problems by means of programmes leading to published reports on the state of knowledge. The meeting reported here was the major British contribution to the SCOPE Programme on the Ecology of Biological Invasions. It is a slightly unusual programme for SCOPE in that the subject is an entirely biological one, and also in that, although most of the problems are caused by invasions induced by man, some can arise as a result of natural extensions of range. Such effects are often acute in ecosystems with a mediterranean climate away from the Mediterranean itself, that is to say in California, South Africa and Australia. These mediterranean zones are in different biogeographical regions, so the organisms native and introduced to them have, in general, no evolutionary experience of each other. Species introduced from one such region to another have frequently spread in semi-natural and natural ecosystems. The SCOPE programme arises from concern about the impact and management of such pests in particular. The preamble to the programme (Anon. 1985) therefore talks about ' the introduction of plants, animals and micro-organisms to regions remote from their centres of origin. ' It goes on to say that the ' areas include a wide variety of non-agricultural, non-urban land such as native forests and rangelands, and protected areas like National Parks and Ecological Reserves.'
