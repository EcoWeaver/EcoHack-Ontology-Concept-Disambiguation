Characterization of whitebait (Galaxias maculatus) respiratory rates to optimize intensive culture carrying capacities
Galaxias maculatus is an osmeriform native C/sh of the Southern Hemisphere, in which the crystalline lar-vae is considered as a luxury delicacy, for this reason, it has been commercially exploited in Chile, Argenti-na and New Zealand. However, the C/sheries have been rapidly decreasing due to the overexploitation and the predation of introduced species. Because of these events, there is a need to determine a carrying capacity for an intensive C/sh culture. In order to opti-mize stocking densities for C/sh culture, this paper proposes objectives to determine oxygen consump-tion (OC) rates, dissolved oxygen concentrations that produce signs of hypoxia and the average time elapsed between food intake and peak OC in G. macu-latus. In the oxygen experiments under routine meta-bolism conditions, we found that G. maculatus adults and whitebait showed signs of asphyxia at dissolved oxygen concentrations between 1.3 and 2.2 mg L A 1 and that adults tolerated dissolved oxygen levels as low as1.3 mg L A 1 . The results showed that G. macula-tus individuals with an average weight of 0.04 g con-sumed 0.048 mg O 2 h A 1 , whereas individuals with an average weight of 1.4 g consumed 0.345 mg O 2 h A 1 . Galaxias maculatus increased the OC rate by 31%, from 0.39 to 0.51mg O 2 h A 1 g A 1 , occurring 14 min after food intake. The carrying capacities for industrial cultures of G. maculatus, were estimated using an allometric equation (OC 50.2363 A W 0.612), a water PSow rate of 1m 3 h A 1 and an input oxygen concentration of 10 mg L A 1 at 12 1C. The density culture of whitebait (4 g) can be allowed to reach 8^11kg m A 3 ; therefore, these stocking densities reduce the risk of hypoxia and mortality, ensuring the appropriate growth and feed conversion rates.
