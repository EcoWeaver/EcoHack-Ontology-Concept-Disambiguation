Experimental evidence that CO2 and nutrient enrichment do not mediate interactions between a native and an exotic free-floating macrophyte
We investigated the effect of CO2 and nutrient enrichment on competition between two free-floating fern species that co-occur in south-eastern Australia--native Azolla filiculoides and invasive exotic Salvinia molesta. The species were grown in monoculture and competition in a glasshouse experiment where the nutrient medium was replaced weekly to simulate a dynamic system. We found that the relative growth rate (RGR) of both species was greater under high resource conditions, with neither showing a suppressive response due to competition. On the contrary, A. filiculoides had a facilitative effect on S. molesta. In addition, A. filiculoides gained more biomass under high resource conditions relative to S. molesta and the opposite was true under low resource conditions. We conclude that [CO2] and nutrient concentration did not mediate competition between the species but instead influenced RGR independent of competition. These findings suggest that species composition in dynamic water bodies under future conditions may be determined by the species' responses to environmental changes rather than by changes in competitive interactions.
