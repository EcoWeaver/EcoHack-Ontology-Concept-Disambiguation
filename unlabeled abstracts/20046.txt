The eu regulation on invasive alien species
The new eu regulation on invasive alien species constitutes a further key European legislative act - alongside the Habitats Directive - aimed at achieving biodiversity conservation. As such it will be of highly practical significance in the years to come, given that the obligations arising from it will necessarily be connected with impacts on trade and transportation. The following article provides information about the problems invasive alien species (ias) cause for biodiversity as a protected resource. It also elucidates and assesses the new European regulation and, taking German law as an example, also discusses its consequences for national-level strategies aimed at protecting against ias.
