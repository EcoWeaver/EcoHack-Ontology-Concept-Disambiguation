An Invasive Plant Parthenium hysterophorus Reduces Native Forage Cover
While some research has been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa on the alien invasive Parthenium hysterophorus, little work has assessed whether it is poses negative impact on native forages. A field survey was carried out to study the dominant co-existing plant species, and its impact on plant abundance, species, and native forage cover. We found that non-natives were the dominant co-existing plants with P. hysterophorus compared to natives. Plant species (r =-0.889, P = 0.043) and abundance (r =-0.968, P = 0.007) decreased with increasing invasive percent cover. Moreover, native forage plant (Brachiaria reptans; r =-0.922, P = 0.026), Cynodon dactylon; r =-0.972, P = 0.006, Digitaria milanjiana; r =-0.938, P = 0.018, and Indigofera spicata; r =-0.977, P = 0.004) percent cover decreased with increasing invasive percent cover. The study concludes that P. hysterophorus negatively affects plant diversity, and thus, should controlled.
