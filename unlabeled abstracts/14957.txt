Hidden invertebrate diversity - phytotelmata in Bromeliaceae from palm houses and florist wholesalers (Poland)
Bromeliads accumulate water in the leaf axils (forming phytotelmata), which may then form a habitat for many animal species of both invertebrates and vertebrates. In temperate regions, bromeliads are commonly displayed in palm houses and distributed by florist wholesalers. Taking into account the fact that global plant trade can be a source of spreading alien species, the phytotelmata that had formed within the bromeliads were examined here in order to study the protists and invertebrates associated with this habitat. In the examined Bromeliaceae micro-reservoirs representatives of testate amoebae (Euglyphida and Arcellinida), Gastrotricha, Nematoda, Rotifera, Polychaeta, Cladocera, Copepoda and mites (Oribatida, Mesostigmata and Heterostigmatina) were found. Additionally, unidentified Nemertea, Turbellaria, Insecta larvae and single representative of Mollusca were also found. Thirty taxa are recorded for the first time from bromeliads micro-reservoirs. Among the identified taxa, the gastrotrich
