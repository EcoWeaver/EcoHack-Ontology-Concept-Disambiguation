Hemigrapsus sanguineus (De Haan, 1835) (Crustacea: Brachyura: Grapsoidea) a new invasive species in European waters: the case of the French English Channel coast (2008-2010)
The unintentional introduction of the Asian shore crab, Hemigrapsus sanguineus, along the French coast during the mid 1990s has revealed the problematic effects that invasive species can have on biodiversity, entering into competition with native crab species. This invasion along coastal ecosystems of northern France has become an ineluctable, irreversible phenomenon. The present study describes the distribution and abundance of H. sanguineus along the French side of the English Channel from the Cotentin to the Opal Coast on the Dover Strait in spring and summer 2010. The results were compared with those obtained previously in 2008 and 2009 for the same areas and now show that the crab has increased in numbers since its first sighting in 1999. In 2010, the maximal abundance reached 51 ind.m(-2) in Dunkirk harbour, and 69 ind.m(-2) at La Hougue in the eastern part of the Cotentin Peninsula. Hemigrapsus sanguineus has been sighted all along the southern coastline of the English Channel to the North Sea (approximately 1,500 km). Its high colonisation potential suggests that this brachyuran could continue its invasion in European waters. Therefore a European surveillance network might be necessary to monitor its progression in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean.
