Environment and development economics 20 years on
This paper reviews the evolution of the field of environment and development over the last two decades. I argue that a central concern of the field has been the relation between natural resource use, income and growth, under the institutional and market conditions that prevail in developing countries. Particular attention is paid to the demographic and other drivers of change in the asset base, the linkages between poverty, property rights and the allocation of natural resources, the valuation of environmental assets and investment of resource rents, and the development of policies for managing environmental externalities and environmental public goods. I consider how the balance between topics and the treatment of individual topics has changed over time, and indicate how the field might be expected to move in the future.
