Low diversity and high levels of population genetic structuring in introduced eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) in the greater Melbourne area, Australia
Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were introduced into Australia in 1925 and released to control mosquitoes. Gambusia holbrooki rapidly became invasive in recipient environments and now threaten native fauna. In this study, we used five polymorphic microsatellite loci and sequence from two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase I, to evaluate genetic variation, colonisation and movement patterns of introduced G. holbrooki in the greater Melbourne area, and to assist in identifying the feasibility of local eradication. Microsatellite variation was consistently low within populations and there was evidence of bottleneck events for several populations. Populations displayed significant structuring associated with river basins rather than geographic distance, suggesting that habitat connectivity is important for dispersal. However, a few populations within river basins were more closely related to populations in other river basins than within their own basin, most likely reflecting a role of human-assisted dispersal in population establishment. Mitochondrial sequencing revealed only a single haplotype and suggested all populations were founded by individuals from a common source. These genetic data help delineate boundaries for local management strategies. Keywords Gambusia holbrooki -Eastern mosquitofish-Invasive-Microsatellites-Mitochondrial DNA-Australia
