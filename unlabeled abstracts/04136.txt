Response to Comments on "Invasive Harlequin Ladybird Carries Biological Weapons Against Native Competitors"
Comments by de Jong et al ., Solter et al ., and Sloggett question the ecological relevance of the abundant microsporidia found in the invasive ladybird Harmonia axyridis . We contend that there is abundant evidence that native ladybirds feed on H. axyridis eggs and that interspecific microsporidial transfer is a common phenomenon, supporting the proposed role of these parasites as biological weapons.
