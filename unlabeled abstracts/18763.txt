Predicting the probable distribution and threat of invasive Mimosa diplotricha Suavalle and Mikania micrantha Kunth in a protected tropical grassland
Invasion of native communities by exotic species has been among the most perverse ecological problems in recent years. In the present study, we predicted the probable distribution of two invasive plant species Mimosa diplotricha Sauvalle and Mikania micrantha Kunth in a protected tropical grassland of Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park, Assam, Northeast India using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) distribution modelling algorithm. We found that about 30-40% (25-30 km2) area of the protected area (78.8 km2) have high chances of being invaded by both the invasive plants that are prime habitat to the greater one horned Rhinoceros and other important grassland dwellers. Both the models have an accuracy of AUC > 0.99. Precipitation in warmest quarters played a major role among the environmental variables in spread of both the invasive plants. The findings of the present study will help the management authority to take the necessary steps in the identified area to chalk out a comprehensive strategy for control of the invasive plant species. The probable areas most likely to be invaded by the invasive plant species have to be monitored regularly, and intervention like manual uprooting needs to be scheduled during the early stage of its life cycle and before flowering. The frontline staffs of the national park need to be apprised about the ecology and impact of invasive plants for better monitoring and eradication of these detrimental plants.
