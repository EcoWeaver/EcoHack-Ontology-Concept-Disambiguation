Vectors of Heracleum sosnowskyi Manden. Invasion on the territory of Moscow region: history and modernity (as exemplified by the Shakhovskaya Urban District)
Sosnovsky's hogweed (Heracleum sosnowskyi Manden.) was used as an ornamental plant since the middle of the 20th century, but has now become a dangerous invasive weed having invaded the ecosystems of Moscow region. Based on the literature and new original data obtained through observations on H. sosnowskyi dispersal across Moscow region, H. sosnowskyi pathways (dispersal vectors) that have existed since the culture was introduced in the 1960s until 2020 are being discussed now. Recently, a new dispersal vector that has important implications for the spread of H. sosnowskyi seeds is the use of lands infested with H. sosnowskyi as hayfields. As exemplified by the Shakhovskaya urban district, it is shown that the measures taken to provide chemical treatment of roadside areas and thickets accessible for transport have already yielded tangible results. The paper is concerned with the trends in H. sosnowskyi ranges changing as a result of dispersal into forests, hard-to-reach old-fallow meadows, and river floodplains, with areas that are unlikely to be cultivated and are a continuous source for further dispersal.
