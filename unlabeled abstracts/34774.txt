Serotype and clonal distribution dynamics of invasive pneumococcal strains after PCV13 introduction (2011-2016): Surveillance data from 23 sites in Catalonia, Spain
BACKGROUND:The objective of this study is to describe incidence and shifts of serotype and clonal distribution of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae strains in four different age groups (65 years) during a period of intermediate PCV13 vaccination coverage (2011-2016) in Catalonia, Spain. METHODS:We included all pneumococcal strains systematically sent to the Catalan support laboratory for molecular surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) located at Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona. Two study periods were considered: 2011-13, early PCV13 vaccination period (EVP) and 2014-2016, late vaccination period (LVP). RESULTS:A total of 2142 strains were included in the study. Five years after intermediate introduction of PCV13 in our population, a significant decrease of overall incidence of IPD in children
