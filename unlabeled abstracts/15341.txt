Invasive species may offer advanced phytoremediation of endocrine disrupting chemicals in aquatic ecosystems
One of the major areas of advancement in environmental science is bioremediation. Researchers have been using bacteria, fungi, algae and now macrophytes to remove pollutants from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Here we share the results of a study on the macrophyte uptake of xenoestrogens from an urban river. We found that the invasive curly leaf pond weed (Potamogeton illinoensis) accumulated an average of 66% higher levels of estrogenic compounds and 94% more Bisphenol-A than the native Illinois pondweed (Potamogeton crispus) in an urban river, in the watershed for the greater Chicago, IL area. The invasive species accumulated 76% more estrone, 55% more 17 b-estradiol and 31% more 17 b-ethynylestradiol than the native species. The Nonnative plants were also 72% larger than the native Illinois Pondweed. Managers may consider using invasive species to remove pollutants from ecosystems and restore ecosystem biogeochemistry.
