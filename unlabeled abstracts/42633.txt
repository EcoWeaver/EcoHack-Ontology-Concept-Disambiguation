Chromosome numbers of invasive and potentially invasive species in the flora of the Republic of Altai. III
Chromosome numbers (2n) in 10 invasive and potentially invasive plant species from the families Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Fabaceae, Malvaceae, Oxalidaceae, Poaceae and Solanaceae are reported on the samples collected in the Republic of Altai. To determine the ploidy levels, we used methods of direct chromosome counting and flow cytometry in some cases. Among them, chromosome complements were first examined in Russia for Eruca vesicaria subsp. sativa (2n = 22). Psammophiliella muralis (2n = 34), Medicago sativa subsp. varia (2n  32; 2C = 4.8 pg) and Solanum nigrum (2n = 48) were first studied from Siberia. Malva verticillata (2n = 42), Oxalis dillenii (2n = 24), Lolium perenne (2n = 14) and Setaria faberi (2n = 36) were first studied from the Republic of Altai. Tetraploid cytotype and genome size of Picris hieracioides (2n = 4x = 20; 2C = 8.89 pg) were discovered for the first time. Common distribution and the history of floristic findings of these species in the Republic of Altai are given. Previously published data on chromosome numbers from Russia are cited.
