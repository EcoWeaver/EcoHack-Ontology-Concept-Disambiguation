A field experiment on the reproductive success of the invasive clam Mya arenaria (Bivalvia) in the Tagus estuary: coexistence with the native clam Scrobicularia plana
A three month field experiment with tidal level (upper, middle, lower) and treatment (excavated and not excavated plots) as categorical experimental factors showed that the invasive clam Mya arenaria has reached a more advanced stage in the invasion process in the Tagus estuary. As we observed the smallest recruited juveniles of Mya arenaria (2 mm) throughout the study period, we concluded that the clam is capable of reproducing in the new habitat. Juveniles of both Mya arenaria and the bivalve Scrobicularia piano were found to avoid excavated experimental plots, showing a significantly higher abundance in the control plots. These data, strongly suggest that the recruited bivalves actively avoid unsuitable substrata. Juvenile specimens of Mya arenaria were more abundant in the mid-intertidal zone. However, juvenile specimens of Scrobicularia piano were mainly distributed in the upper intertidal level, which suggests that they have a different settlement behaviour from that observed for the juveniles of the invasive clam. Despite the divergent distribution between the juveniles of the two species in the study site, the possible interaction between these two species is considered and discussed.
