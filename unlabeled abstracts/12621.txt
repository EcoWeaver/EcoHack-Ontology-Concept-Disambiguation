Lernaea cyprinacea (Crustacea: Copepoda) in the Iberian Peninsula: climate implications on host-parasite interactions
The non-native parasitic anchor worm (Lernaea cyprinacea) may induce anaemia, malformations, reduced growth and increased susceptibility to secondary infection to its hosts. The objectives of this study were to (i) compile a list of the host species of L. cyprinacea in the Iberian Peninsula and (ii) assess if climate may impact on infestation levels of the parasite. There were two primary sources for data collection: (i) fish sampling in the Tormes Basin (Avila, central Spain) during August 2010 and 2016 and (ii) data retrieved from publications containing relevant information about L. cyprinacea. Eleven temperature variables were obtained from Worldclim. Next, the relationship between infestation levels of the anchor worm (prevalence, intensity and abundance) and temperature was tested using mixed models. Fifteen cyprinids species among 18 species are host of L. cyprinacea in the Iberian Peninsula. Infestation levels of the anchor worm are highly connected to temperature. Finally, the possible implications of global warming for host-parasite interactions are discussed.
