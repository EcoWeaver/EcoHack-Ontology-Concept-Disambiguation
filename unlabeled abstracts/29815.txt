Mislabeled: eco-labeling an invasive alien shellfish fishery
The invasive alien Manila clam fishery from Ria Arousa, Spain, was recommended for a Marine Stewardship Council certificate which implies the fishery maintains the integrity of the ecosystem. By certifying an environmentally harmful invasive alien clam fishery, the MSC harms the environment and risks its credibility, at the time when environmental responsibility and social responsibility are increasingly important to policymakers, industry, and consumers, particularly in Europe. We call on the MSC to reassess their evaluation of the Ruditapes philippinarum fishery in Ria Arousa, Spain.
