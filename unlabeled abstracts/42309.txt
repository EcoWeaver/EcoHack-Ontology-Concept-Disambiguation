Managing invasive plants through a nature-based approach in complex landscapes
Invasive plants are establishing in many protected areas where use of synthetic herbicides is prohibited. We introduce a nature-based approach (NbA) as an alternative to controlling invasives. The integration of NbA into ecosystem conservation provides potential to suppress invasive plants, improve soil cover, increase the diversity of native plants, and ultimately ensure ecosystem sustainability.
