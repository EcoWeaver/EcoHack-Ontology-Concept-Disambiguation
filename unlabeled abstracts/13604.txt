Effects of plant litter diversity, species, origin and traits on larval toad performance
Decreased plant diversity is expected to reduce ecosystem function. Although many studies have examined effects of plant species on trophic interactions, information regarding effects of native or non-native plant diversity on performance of individuals of higher trophic levels is limited. We reared larval American toad Anaxyrus americanus tadpoles in outdoor mesocosms containing litter of 1, 3, 6 or 12 plant species drawn randomly from a pool of 24 (15 native, 9 nonnative) species. Tadpole performance varied significantly among litter types in single litter treatments and pH and litter C:N were significant predictors of tadpole performance. Metamorphs were larger in mixtures than expected based on performance in single species treatments, suggesting a non-additive effect of diversity. Litter diversity did not affect probability of survival or probability of metamorphosis. Plant origin (native or non-native) had no significant effect on amphibian performance. Our study suggests some benefits to tadpole development at low levels of plant diversity, but questions assumed benefits of increased plant diversity and assumed detrimental effects of nonnative plant species for a common larval amphibian. Presence of specific plant species with strong negative effects on tadpole performance may outweigh diversity benefits in brown food webs.
