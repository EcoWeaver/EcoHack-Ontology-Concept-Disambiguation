Invasive non-native species in Great Britain--policy and delivery, with specific reference to Reeves' muntjac
Invasive non-native (alien) species (INNS) are one of the greatest environmental threats globally and they pose a serious and growing risk to our environment, economy and, for some species, human health. Humans have been moving species around for millennia but this movement has been increasing steadily since the start of the industrial revolution and this growth continues--fuelled by increasing trade and movement of people. Recognising this threat, governments in Great Britain over the last 20 years have been steadily increasing their policy response to INNS and this has resulted in increased delivery on the ground including via eradications of a number of species, mainly vertebrates. The coming into force of the EU IAS Regulation in 2015 has also provided an impetus particularly related to listed species of which the muntjac was in the first tranche to be listed. This mini-review summarises general government policy and delivery in GB, referencing the muntjac where appropriate.
