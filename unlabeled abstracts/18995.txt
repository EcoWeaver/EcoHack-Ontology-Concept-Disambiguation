The influence of an invasive plant species on the pollination success and reproductive output of three riparian plant species
Besides competition for abiotic resources, an increasing number of studies show evidence of the effects of invasive species on the pollination success and reproductive output of indigenous species. We studied the effect of the invasive Impatiens glandulifera Royle on the process of reproduction in the indigenous Lythrum salicaria L. and Alisma plantago-aquatica L. and the naturalized Oenothera biennis L. The latter three species (target species) were transplanted into pots and placed in invaded and non-invaded areas. During flowering season of each of these species, we measured species composition and abundance of pollinators, pollinator behaviour, pollen deposition and female reproductive output of the target species. Competitive effects were found for L. salicaria, in which fewer pollinator species and number of foraging individuals were observed, and also, lower pollen deposition and seed set were measured in these invaded populations. In contrast, the reproductive success of A. plantago-aquatica and O. biennis was not affected by the presence of I. glandulifera. Our data indicate that when invasive and indigenous species show a large overlap in pollinator community, which is the case for I. glandulifera and L. salicaria, competition between these species can occur. When both species have a different pollinator community, pollination success and reproductive output is not affected, even when the indigenous populations are densely and abundantly invaded.
