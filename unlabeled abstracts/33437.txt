Widespread displacement of the exotic whitefly species Bemisia tabaci B by Bemisia tabaci Q in fields in Shandong,China
To reveal the distribution and infestation status of Bemisia tabaci cryptic species,asystematic and comprehensive survey on its species composition was conducted in Shandong,China.Sixty-nine collections of adult whiteflies were sampled from 22 locations distributed in 15 counties in Shandong during July - August,2013,the cryptic species of the 1 387 individuals was determined based on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I ( mtCOI ) PCR-RFLP method, and the percentages of B. tabaci Q on different host plants and in geographical regions were analyzed. The results showed that the percentage of B. tabaci Q was 100% in 17 locations and was > 90% in five locations ( Weifang,Heze,Tai'an,Zibo,and Linyi) ,where B. tabaci B was found with low percentage( < 10%) . The average percentages of B. tabaci Q did not differ significantly among the populations on the five hosts ( eggplant,pepper,cucumber,tomato and cotton) and in the three areas ( the western plain region,the eastern hilly region and the central mountains region) .The results indicate that B. tabaci Q is predominant in all the investigated locations,suggesting that B. tabaci Q has completely displaced B. tabaci B in most regions of Shandong,China.
