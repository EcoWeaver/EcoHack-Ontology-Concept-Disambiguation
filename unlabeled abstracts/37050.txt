Strength of niche processes for species interactions is lower for generalists and exotic species
Niche and neutral processes jointly influence species interactions. Predictions of interactions based on these processes assume that they operate similarly across all species. However, species characteristics could systematically create differences in the strength of niche or neutral processes for each interspecific interaction. We used national-level records of plant-frugivore interactions, species traits, biogeographic status (native vs. exotic), phylogenies and species range sizes to test the hypothesis that the strength of niche processes in species interactions changes in predictable ways depending on trophic generalism and biogeographic status of the interacting species. The strength of niche processes (measured as trait matching) decreased when the generalism of the interacting partners increased. Furthermore, the slope of this negative relationship between trait matching and generalism of the interacting partners was steeper (more negative) for interactions between exotic species than those between native species. These results remained significant after accounting for the potential effects of neutral processes (estimated by species range size). These observed changes in the strength of niche processes in generating species interactions, after accounting for effects of neutral processes, could improve predictions of ecological networks from species trait data. Specifically, due to their shorter coevolutionary history, exotic species tend to interact with native species even when lower trait matching occurs than in interactions among native species. Likewise, interactions between generalist bird species and generalist plant species should be expected to occur despite low trait matching between species, whereas interactions between specialist species involve higher trait matching.
