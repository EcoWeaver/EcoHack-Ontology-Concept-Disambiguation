Introduced species community over-dominates endemic ichthyofauna of High Lika Plateau (Central Croatia) over a 100 year period
106 years after Trgovcic (1908) authors made a revised list of fish species found in rivers and streams of the Lika region. Throughout the 8 years of investigation a total of 31 species of freshwater fish were recorded, of which only eight are indigenous for this area, for two species the origin is not known, and the remaining 21 species are introduced by anthropogenic activity over the last 100 years. This represents the over-domination of introduced species by the astonishing 300%. All of this increase in numbers causes significant increase in biomass and changes the naturally oligotrophic ecosystem, which might lead to rapid eutrophication and increase of water temperature. Furthermore, induced changes in the system make the habitat more suitable for introduced cyprinid fish, which again causes the increase of biomass production. Endemic fish species are retreating into upper parts of small tributaries and underground cave systems. The present research indicates species Delminichthys jadovensis, D. krbavensis, Telestes fontinalis and T. croaticus as real stygophiles, which makes them unique on the European continent.
