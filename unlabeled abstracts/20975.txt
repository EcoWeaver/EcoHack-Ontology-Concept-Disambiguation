Hypania invalida (Grube, 1960), a polychaete species new for the southern Baltic estuarine area: the Szczecin Lagoon and the River Odra mouth
During a study carried out in spring-summer 2010, the invasive Ponto-Caspian polychaete Hypania invalida (Grube, 1960) was recorded for the first time in the southern part of the River Odra estuary (southern Baltic). This is the first record of this species in Poland or in any a Baltic estuary. The appearance of H. invalida in the Odra estuary coincided with flood water descent in the Odra, suggesting that floods can aid in dispersal of this polychaete.
