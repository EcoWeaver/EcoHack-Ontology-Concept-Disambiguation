Xenostrobus securis (Lamarck, 1819) (Mollusca: Bivalvia): first report of an introduced species in Galician waters
The presence of the non-indigenous species, the black-pygmy mussel Xenostrobus securis, is reported here for the first time in an intense shellfish farming area off Galicia (NW Spain). Very high concentrations of this mytilid bivalve have colonized estuarine waters located at the inner part of the Ria de Vigo. The invasive role of X. securis is discussed in the context of the wide ecological tolerance of the species and the recent finding of settlements of this species on numerous colonies of the economically-important blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. The mode of introduction of the black-pygmy mussel is also discussed in relation to human management activities.
