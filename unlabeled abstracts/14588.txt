Composition and length-weight relationships of fish species in Lake Erhai, southwestern China
Length-weight relationships (LWRs) are described for 23 fish species (five indigenous species and 18 exotic species) in Lake Erhai, a plateau deep lake located in southwestern China. Four different types of fishing gear were used in order to include all possible length ranges from 2009 to 2012. Results show that the exponent b ranged from 2.72 to 3.79. The length of the growth inflection point between juveniles and females of Pseudorasbora parva and Micropercops swinhonis coincides with the length at which 50% of the females are sexually mature, respectively. The LWRs of P. parva and M. swinhonis are affected by sexual dimorphism, and Hemiculter leucisculus shows significant differences between juveniles and females. In addition, the first LWR records for nine species are provided in this study.
