Interactive effects of habitat destruction and competition on exotic invasion
Invasive exotic species and habitat destruction are the major causes of biodiversity loss. Previous studies mostly focus on the effects of habitat fragmentation and dispersal abilities on invasion success. In this paper, the interactive effects of habitat destruction and competition have been studied by a multi-species model based on competition-dispersal trade-off. The results show that: 1) The interaction between native and exotic species can be direct competition as well as indirect facilitation.2) The extinction of native species caused by invasive species will proceed in order from best to poorest. 3) It is not always the superior competitor that invades successfully. 4) Habitat destruction can inhibit as well as promote invasion, which is decided by the interaction of habitat destruction and competition. So, the interaction of habitat destruction and competition should be taken into consideration when planning to control exotic invasion and to recover habitat. Moreover, it will be effective and efficient to protect and improve superior competitor next to exotic species for invasion control.
