The problem of invaders in the Caspian Sea in the context of the findings of new zoo- and phytoplankton species from the Black Sea
In April 2004, an expedition to the Caspian Sea discovered the species in the Middle Caspian not previously described in this sea. These species preliminary identified as Oithona similis Claus 1963, Sagitta setosa Muller 1847, and Calanus euxinus (Hulsemann) are the main representatives of edible plankton of the Black Sea; most likely they were introduced into the Caspian Sea with ballast waters of ships passing through the Volga-Don Canal. At present, it is difficult to say if these species will be established in the Caspian Sea; if so, they will clearly become a valuable food resource for planktophagous fish in the Caspian Sea. In addition, we discovered two diatom species typical for the Black Sea phytoplankton, Pseudo-nitzschia seriata (Cleve) H. Peragallo and M. Peragallo and Cerataulina pelagica (Cleve) Hendey which invaded the Caspian Sea in recent years. Pseudo-nitzschia seriata synthesizes a toxin (domoic acid) and can become harmful for the basin in the case of mass bloom. We discuss the problem of spontaneous invasion of alien species from the Black Sea and their effect on the Caspian ecosystem in the context of these findings.
