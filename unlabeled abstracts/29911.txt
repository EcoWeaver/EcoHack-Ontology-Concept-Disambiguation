The factors limiting growth and survival of brown trout, Salmo trutta m.fario L. introduced to different types of streams
Fingerlings of brown trout (Salmo trulta m. fario L.) were introduced to sections of different types of streams situated in natural catchments and those modified by Man's activity. At stations where environmental conditions were modified by such forms of impact as pollution, flow variability and impoundment, trout did not survive 5 months. In the natural river sections mortality rates increased downstream along the river continuum and were associated with increased predation. Growth rates in the upper reaches were primarily restricted by abiotic factors--temperature and trophic status: however, they were to a large extent modified by density-dependent regulation and intraspecific competition. The influence of the abiotic/biotic regulatory process, expressed as fish metabolic performance, is discussed as a framework for the determination of the carrying capacity of the riverine ecosystem.
