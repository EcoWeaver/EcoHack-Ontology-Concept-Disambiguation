Ant community associated to citrus canopy in Southern Portugal over a century after the invasion by the Argentine ant
The Argentine ant Linepithema humile (Mayr) established in Algarve, Portugal, about 120 years ago. In this work we assess the current impact of this invasive species on ant communities of citrus orchards and compare the invasibility between different ecological sub-regions in relation to some biotic and abiotic requirements. A novel extensive sampling approach in citrus canopy (including the trunk) along 49 orchards in three ecological subregions was performed. In total 21 species were observed, covering 81% of the species reported for the region. Despite the same habitat, ant species composition differed in contiguous subregions with particular significance to the absence of Argentine ant in the inner subregion. Based on the results we hypothesized the existence of ecological factors at regional scale preventing the establishment of L. humile in this subregion, related to anthropogenic factors and geologically unfavorable sites. At a local scale, its establishment and dominance is associated with ant community composition and a lack of dominant native ant species, which can be responsible for straightening the spread of one of the world most invasive ant species.
