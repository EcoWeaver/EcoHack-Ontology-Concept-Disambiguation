Fish communities and juvenile habitat associated with non-native Rhizophora mangle L. in Hawai'i
There are many well-documented ecosystem services for which mangroves have received protection globally; however, in Hawai'i, where no species of mangroves are native, these services have not been thoroughly evaluated. Twelve permanently open stream mouth estuaries on O'ahu were sampled from September to October 2014. Abiotic factors and fish community data were correlated with percent mangrove cover and the Landscape Development Intensity Index to examine potential relationships among mangroves, humans, and fish communities. The three most abundant species, of 20 species caught, were Kuhlia xenura, Mugil cephalus, and Mulloidichthys flavolineatus. Of these three native species, 99% of the individuals caught were juveniles indicating the overall importance of stream mouth estuaries as juvenile habitat. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis of fish community data showed that K. xenura, M. cephalus, and Lutjanus fulvus were more abundant in shallower sites with lower salinity and higher percent mangrove cover. Stream mouth estuaries with mangroves are important juvenile habitats for the native K. xenura and M. cephalus and the non-native Osteomugil engeli. These species, two of which are important in recreational and subsistence fisheries, will be most likely affected by mangrove removal based on abundance and distribution in mangrove-dominated stream mouth estuaries.
