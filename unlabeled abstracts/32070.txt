Sodium, potassium and nitrogenous osmolyte accumulation inrelation to the adaptation to salinity of Elytrigia pycnantha,an invasive plant of the Mont Saint-Michel Bay
Elytrigia pycnantha (Godr.) Love (also named E. aetherica or Elymus athericus) is a monocot species native of salt marshes of the Mont Saint-Michel Bay. Usually found at the landward edge of the bay, this grass plant is now spraying in the middle of the marsh and even at the tidal hat boundaries. In this study, we have outlined some biochemical traits that may be linked to the spread of this invasive native clonal grass. Plants were collected at the west part of the bay (Le Vivier sur mer) along the salt marsh zonation, some of them were grown further in a glasshouse under different NaCl concentrations and nitrogen sources while others were analysed immediately without treatment. The plants collected from the bay and those treated under controlled conditions were sampled according to different vegetative organs, frozen dried, and water soluble compounds extracted. Potassium and sodium contents were measured by flam photometry and amino acids and betaine through HPLC procedure analysis. It is shown that sodium accumulation and amino acid profiles depend both on the location of the plant on the salt marsh and on the plant organ. We have also highlighted an effect of the nitrogen source (no N, N-NO3- or N-NH4+) on plant response to salt treatment. It is suggested that recent ability of this species to spray is related to its ability to perform nitrogenous metabolic adjustment under new nitrogen source availability.
