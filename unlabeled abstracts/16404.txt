An invasive alien species, the harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Pallas, 1773), has quickly expanded its distribution in Eastern Europe. Records of H. axyridis from 31 localities in Lithuania, Latvia, the Ukraine, European Russia, and the Northern Caucasus are summarized and mapped. Within the last few years this species has established in south Latvia, on the Baltic Sea shore (Kaliningrad oblast and Lithuania), in the western and central Ukraine, Crimea, and in the Northern Caucasus. Besides that, individual specimens have been found in 4 more localities in European Russia. The species is recorded from Lipetsk oblast (European Russia), Crimea, and Nikolaev oblast (the Ukraine) for the first time.
