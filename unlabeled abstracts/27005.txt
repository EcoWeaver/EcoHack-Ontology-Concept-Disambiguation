Potential distribution of Solidago canadensis in China
The potential distribution of the invasive perennial Solidago canadensis in China was assessed by using the homoclime approach. This alien weed spreads rapidly in China, invading abandoned fields and disturbed habitats. It is currently abundant in four provinces of southeastern China, with scattered populations in other provinces to the West and North. We used a climatic profile from the native American range and matched it with data from climatic stations throughout China. To map the potential distribution in China, data were extrapolated to form a grid of 0.1 degree latitude by 0.1 degree longitude. Grid points that fall within the climatic profile are assumed to circumscribe the potential distribution. The potential range in China is remarkably larger than the current range, with parts of northeastern China appearing suitable for S. canadensis growth. The latitudes of the potential range span from 25 degrees to 50 degrees. The results show the considerable potential for future spread of S. canadensis in China, implying that control measures should be taken to contain this invasive species.
