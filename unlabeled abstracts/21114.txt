Resistance to Plant Invasion? A Native Specialist Herbivore Shows Preference for and Higher Fitness on an Introduced Host
The response of native herbivores to the introduction of a new plant to the community has important implications for plant invasion. Under the Enemy Release Hypothesis introduced species become invasive because of reduced enemy control in the new range, while under the New Association Hypothesis introduced species lack effective defenses against native enemies because they do not share an evolutionary history. I tested the response of a native South-American specialist herbivore Utetheisa ornatrix (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) to a native (Crotalaria incana) and an introduced host (Crotalaria pallida) (Fabaceae: Papilionoideae). I compared seed predation rates between the two hosts in the field, and I tested preference and performance traits with common garden experiments. Utetheisa ornatrix caused much higher seed predation rates on the introduced host than on the native host. Females also preferred to oviposit on the introduced over the native host. Additionally, larvae feeding on the introduced host had higher fitness (higher pupal weight) than larvae feeding on the native host. I discuss how the response of this specialist herbivore to this introduced host plant contradicts the predictions of the Enemy Release Hypothesis and support the New Association Hypothesis. This study shows that the New Association Hypothesis can also be true for specialist herbivores.
