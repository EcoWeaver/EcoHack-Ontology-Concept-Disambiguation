Extended leaf phenology: a secret of successful invaders?
Smith (2013), in this issue, reviews the consequences of extended leaf phenology of invasive plant species in native deciduous forests. How important is early leaf emergence and/or late leaf senescence for the success of non-native species? What are the direct and indirect impacts on invaded communities and ecosystems? We are just at the very early stage in answering such questions.
