Invasion of coastal dunes by the alien shrub Rosa rugosa is associated with roads, tracks and houses
Mapping the distribution of invasive alien plant species is significant for testing ecological hypotheses and for guiding effective management. Little is known about the distribution of invasive plants at landscape scale, and the factors controlling their dispersal and establishment are still poorly understood. This is the case for Rosa rugosa, an invasive shrub with negative effects on biodiversity in dune ecosystems of NW Europe. The aim of the study was to identify the factors which determine the distribution of R. rugosa in coastal dunes. In a large semi-natural dune area of NW Denmark (2364 ha) all patches of the species (1321, 1.3-59.1 m2) were GPS mapped. Patch distribution was GIS analysed, based on aerial photographs and vegetation maps. The distance of R. rugosa from the most conspicuous landscape elements was compared with randomly placed reference points. The species had invaded 0.35% of the dune landscape, and it was present in all vegetation types and all parts of the study area. Rosa rugosa patches were slightly smaller in grey dunes than in white dunes and brown dunes, and some of the largest patches were found close to villages. The occurrence of the shrub was positively correlated with distance to the coastline, to roads, tracks and houses. We conclude that the distribution of R. rugosa is determined by both natural and anthropogenic factors. It is further discussed how these factors may control dispersal and establishment of the species, and how the results can be used for improved management of coastal dunes.
