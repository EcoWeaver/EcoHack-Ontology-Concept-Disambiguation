Host-specificity of the endangered thick-shelled river mussel (Unio crassus, Philipsson 1788) and implications for conservation
The complex life cycle of the endangered thick-shelled river mussel (Unio crassus, Philipsson 1788) includes an obligatory parasitic phase on a host fish. Consequently, knowledge of the interaction of U. crassus with its host species is crucial for the development of effective conservation strategies.The objective of this study was to assess systematically the host suitability of eight different fish species, including six native species which naturally co-occur with U. crassus, as well as two non-native species. All tested fish species were successfully infected with glochidia of U. crassus, which were present on their gills 2 days after exposure.Phoxinus phoxinus and Squalius cephalus were the most suitable hosts as indicated by both the highest total glochidial load and the highest fish-weight-normalized glochidial load after 16 days and 48 days. Salmo trutta, Alburnoides bipunctatus and Cottus gobio were less suitable, losing ~90% of glochidia within 16 days. Alburnus alburnus, invasive Neogobius melanostomus and introduced Oncorhynchus mykiss lost more than 98% of glochidia within 16 days, indicating they are unsuitable hosts.U. crassus larvae did not grow significantly (
