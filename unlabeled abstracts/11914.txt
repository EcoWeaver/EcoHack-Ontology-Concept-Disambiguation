First Record of Bryozoan Amathia (= Zoobotryon) verticillata (Bryozoa: Vesiculariidae) from Taiwan
The bryozoan Amathia (= Zoobotryon) verticillata was found near the northern entrance to the Port of Kaohsiung in November 2015 and is the first record from Taiwan. This bryozoan can form extensive colonies and is considered to be one of the more invasive nonindigenous species, occurring worldwide from Mediterranean to tropical environments within the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans. Colonies extending to approximately 80 cm in length were on immersed ropes attached to quay walls. It is likely that the species is established in the Port of Kaohsiung. Its distribution within the Pacific is reviewed.
