Cherax quadricarinatus(von Martens) has invaded Indonesian territory west of the Wallace Line: evidences from Java
Cherax quadricarinatus (von Martens) (Decapoda: Astacidea: Parastacidae) is commercially exploited and has been intentionally introduced to various tropical and subtropical countries. Once established in the wild, it frequently becomes invasive. In Indonesia, this crayfish is native only to the southern part of the Papua Province. Cherax quadricarinatus is produced in semi-intensive farms for food as well as for ornamental purposes on most of Indonesian territory. We present here the first record of this species from Java, where this crayfish has formed at least two established feral populations. In total, eight subadult and adult crayfish of both sexes were captured in two natural lakes in the city of Bogor, West Java Province. Based on climate match, we suggest that C. quadricarinatus has high potential to become established within most of Indonesian territory. As a rapidly growing species with broad tolerance to varying environmental conditions, its spread is expected and it should be viewed as a possible threat to native decapod crustaceans. Detailed monitoring is therefore needed.
