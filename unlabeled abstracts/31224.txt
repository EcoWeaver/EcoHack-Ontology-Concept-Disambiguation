Winter swarming behavior by the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi Sars, 1885 in a Kentucky (USA) reservoir
We describe swarming behavior in the invasive cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi Sars, 1885 in a Kentucky, USA, reservoir during winter 2017. The taxon is a highly successful tropical invader and has spread throughout the lower latitude systems in the USA since its discovery in 1991. Other than a few isolated reports, the abundance of D. lumholtzi is often <1 organism L-1. Previous studies indicate that D. lumholtzi is a largely thermophilic species often peaking in abundance in late summer after native daphnids are gone from the water column of lakes and reservoirs. Prior to our study, there have been no published reports of swarming behavior by this species. We document the occurrence of massive swarms (>10,000 organisms L-1) of sexually reproducing females of this exotic cladoceran at water column temperatures <10 degC.
