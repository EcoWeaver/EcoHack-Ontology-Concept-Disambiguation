The potential of symptomless potted plants for carrying invasive soilborne plant pathogens
The most common pathway for the movement of plant pests across borders is the horticultural trade in live plants, especially potted ornamentals. Soilborne pathogens, possibly alien and potentially invasive, have a higher possibility of surviving transportation and becoming established at their destination if they are carried in potted plants. The European Union (EU) has an open-door phytosanitary system, under which any plant that is not specifically regulated can be imported. Inspections are focussed on a small number of economically important plant pests and even then limited to visual examinations of the aerial parts of the plant. Inspections fail to detect regulated pests or others internal to the tissues, or in the soil, if plants appear asymptomatic, or if incipient symptoms are limited to the roots. Phytophthora, a soilborne pathogen universally infamous for its ruinous outbreaks, but poorly regulated in Europe, was chosen to illustrate the risk inherent in the nursery pathway. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the level of infestation by Phytophthora in ornamental plants largely traded to, from and within Europe.
