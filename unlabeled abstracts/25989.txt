Size-selective predation by round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) on dreissenid mussels in the field
Although numerous studies have shown that round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) prey on dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis), there is an apparent shortage of detailed field studies on the subject. The 5-month field study described here quantifies predation by round gobies on dreissenids in Presque Isle Bay, Lake Erie. Dreissenids dominated the diet of round gobies, composing 92% of the prey items recovered. Over half of the 3870 valves (1935 mussels) recovered from 155 round gobies were crushed, while the remainder were swallowed whole. Crushed dreissenids were larger than those swallowed whole, and the tendency to crush dreissenids did not vary among three length classes of round goby. Round goby length was positively related to average size of dreissenids consumed, average size of whole and crushed dreissenids, largest whole dreissenid consumed, and largest crushed dreissenid consumed. Indices of selectivity revealed similarly shaped curves for three length classes of round gobies, a shift toward larger dreissenid size classes with an increase in round goby length, and peak preferences for 8-11mm dreissenids. Factors such as gape limitation, availability and accessibility of differently sized dreissenids, forces generated while removing mussels from the substrate and crushing them, and caloric content of dreissenids all likely play roles in the observed size-selectivity and differential processing of dreissenids. Although factors influencing size-selectivity are not completely understood, the observed preference of round gobies for dreissenids near the size when they are first reproductive could impact the demography of dreissenid populations.
