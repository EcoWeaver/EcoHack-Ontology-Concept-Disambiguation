ALIEN SPECIES OF FISH HELMINTHS OF BELARUS
The article provides data on the species composition of alien helminth species, which infest introduced fish species in pond fish farms, and also the literature data on natural reservoirs of Belarus. Seven alien helminth species have been revealed in introduced fish in reservoirs of Belarus ( Khawia sinensis Hsu, 1935, Schyzocotyle acheilognathi (Yamaguti, 1934) , Caryophyllaeus fimbriceps Annenkova-Chlopina, 1919, Philometroides cyprini (Ishii, 1931), Dactylogyrus dulkeiti Bychowsky, 1936, Bothriocephalus claviceps (Goeze, 1782) , Anguillicola crassus Kuwahara 1974). All species of helminths excluding the nematode A.crassus and the cestode B.claviceps - parasites of the eels Anguilla anguilla , were introduced to Belarus with the seeding of Cyprinus carpio haematopterus (Linnaeus, 1758) from the Far East. The invasive species of helminths ( K. sinensis, S. acheilognathi, P. cyprini, A. crassus ), which affect fishery by causing the death of farmed fish, are singled out.
