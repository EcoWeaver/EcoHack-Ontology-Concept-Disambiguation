The phylogenetic structure of plant facilitation networks changes with competition
1. Ecological communities are assembled as complex networks of both positive (i.e. facilitation) and negative (i.e. competition) interactions. In networks established among plant species, many facilitative interactions occurring between a benefactor - a nurse - and a beneficiary - a facilitated seedling - turn into competition over time as the facilitated seedling grows and outcompetes the nurse. The facilitative associations that disappear over time are mainly restricted to closely related taxa, because close relatives tend to share niche requirements and compete more strongly for the same resources. In consequence, the phylogenetic structure of a network might change as positive associations become negative.
