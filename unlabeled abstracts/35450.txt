Migratory behavior and winter geography drive differential range shifts of eastern birds in response to recent climate change
Significance Over the past half century, populations of neotropical migratory birds in North America have plummeted while populations of resident species have largely remained stable. We show that resident and migratory birds in eastern North America have responded differently to climate change over this period, with the ranges of resident species expanding along their northern margin while the ranges of migratory species have contracted at their southern margin. These results suggest that the ability to colonize newly suitable areas may make resident species resilient to future climate change but that climate-induced range contractions may make neotropical migrants vulnerable to these changes.
