Effect of intraguild predation on the survival and development of three species of aphidophagous ladybirds: consequences for invasive species
Abstract 1 Survival and development of hatchling larvae of three aphidophagous ladybirds (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Harmonia axyridis Pallas, Coccinella septempunctata brucki Mulsant and Adalia bipunctata Linnaeus, when fed their own and the other species eggs were recorded. 2 In all three species, the larvae survived when fed conspecific eggs. 3 The percentage of larvae of H. axyridis that survived decreased to 35% and 85% when fed eggs of A. bipunctata and C. s. brucki, respectively. All the larvae of A. bipunctata and C. s. brucki died after eating eggs of H. axyridis. None of the larvae of C. s. brucki died after eating eggs of A. bipunctata, whereas 46% of those of A. bipunctata died after eating eggs of C. s. brucki. 4 In general, larvae were reluctant to eat the eggs of other species. However, larvae of C. s. brucki showed less reluctance than H. axyridis to eat the eggs of A. bipunctata. 5 The consequence of this for invasive species of ladybird is discussed.
