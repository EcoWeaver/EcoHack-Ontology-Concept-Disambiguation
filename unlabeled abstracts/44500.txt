Assessment of the current distribution, dispersal trends and impacts of invasive species in Bana - Nui Chua Nature Reserve, Vietnam
Invasive species threaten the biodiversity and the function of ecosystems. Drone image, satellite images, and image analysis software were used to create the map of invasive distribution and the potential spreading of invasive plants. 13 most invasive plants were identified with 11 species listed as invasive species in Southeast Asia and 5 of them in the 100 world's invasive species by IUCN. Three species Merremia boisiana (Gagn.) van Ooststr., Ipomoea eberhardtii Gagn, and Mimosa pigra were identified as the species with high-ranking impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem biodiversity in Ba Na - Nui Chua Nature Reserve (BNNR). Ipomoea eberhardtii Gagn shows the highest spreading rate at 0.65 +- 0.06 ha/month, followed by Merremia boisiana (Gagn.) van Ooststr) and Mimosa pigra at 0.12 +- 0.01 ha/month and 0.01 +- 0.001 ha/month respectively. Fresh biomass of Ipomoea eberhardtii Gagn; Merremia boisiana (Gagn.); Mimosa pigra and Sphagnetola trilobata (L.) Pruski in BNNR are 15.67; 14.9; 8.1 and 6.8 ton/ha. The database of invasive plant distribution and potential spreading will be used to monitor strategies and invasive weeds management in BNNR.
