Microbial invasion of the Caribbean by an Indo-Pacific coral zooxanthella
Significance This research documents the spread of an opportunistic coral endosymbiont, Symbiodinium trenchii , from the Indo-Pacific into the Greater Caribbean, a region afflicted by human-related impacts including climate warming and environmental degradation. As a symbiont, it increases the resilience of photosynthetic corals to environmental perturbation but may diminish the animal's capacity to calcify and build reefs. This work exposes a critical need to better understand the consequences of microbial introductions (even mutualistic species) on ecosystem stability and function and raises questions about the long-term impact of new, but maladapted, symbioses on the productivity of reef coral communities in the Atlantic Ocean.
