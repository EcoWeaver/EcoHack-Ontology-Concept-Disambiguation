The bougainvillea mealybug, Phenacoccus peruvianus Granara de Willink, in Granara de Willink & Szumik, 2007 (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), an invasive species new to North America, with a description of the adult male and new host records
Phenacoccus peruvianus Granara de Willink, in Granara de Willink & Szumik, 2007, the bougainvillea mealybug (Hemiptera: Coccomorpha: Pseudococcidae), is recorded from California and North America for the first time. Comparison of the morphology of the adult females from California with those described from South America, found a closer match with specimens from Argentina than with those from Peru. The adult male is described for the first time and compared with that of Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley, 1898. A table listing all 36 known host plant families in California is appended, 28 of which are new. DNA sequences from the COI and 18S portions of the genome were analyzed and compared with those available for specimens of P. peruvianus introduced to Europe and those of other congeners, confirming conspecificity between the Californian and European specimens and displaying interspecific genetic differences from other known Phenacoccus species within the range of values so far known to occur within the genus.
