Impacts of excessive dietary phosphorus on zebra mussels
Stoichiometric theory predicts that organisms should experience dietary imbalances not only when nutrients (e.g., phosphorus, P) are limiting relative to carbon (C), but also when nutrients are in excess (i.e., well above somatic demand). Nevertheless, few experiments have elucidated the response of consumers in such low C:P conditions. We assessed the growth, tissue stoichiometry, and nutrient excretion of the invasive primary consumer, zebra mussel (ZM), Dreissena polymorpha, under three dietary C:P conditions (C:P = 20, 45, 380) in the laboratory. The two low C:P conditions represent increasingly common eutrophic systems, while the high C:P treatment is representative of oligotrophic systems. Growth rates and condition were lower when ZMs were fed a low C:P (20 and 45) diet, compared to the C:P = 380 treatment, wherein ZMs grew rapidly and exhibited lower somatic C:P. Furthermore, ZMs in the C:P = 20 and C:P = 45 treatments excreted more ammonia indicative of protein catabolism. These results clearly show that hypereutrophic conditions invoke significant shifts in physiology, growth, and condition of ZMs. Together, these results are consistent with stoichiometric theory that predicts costs associated with the intake of excess dietary P.
