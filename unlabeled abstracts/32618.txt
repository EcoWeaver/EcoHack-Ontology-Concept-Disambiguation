A REVIEW OF THE INVASIVE, BIOLOGICAL AND BENEFICIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF AQUATIC SPECIES EICHHORNIA CRASSIPES AND SALVINIA MOLESTA
The aquatic invasive plant species Eichhornia crassipes and Salvinia molesta originated in the Neotropics (Bolenz et al., 1990; Tipping and Center, 2005). Based on environmental, economic and human problems, E. crassipes and S. molesta are ranked first and second places respectively on a list of the world's most problematic aquatic weeds (Holm et al., 1977; Barrett, 1989). This review paper presents the impacts of these two species on the environment, mainly in aquatic ecosystems of the tropics and subtropics, and also their use in societies and agro-industry with particular reference to their distribution and environmental impacts in ecosystems.
