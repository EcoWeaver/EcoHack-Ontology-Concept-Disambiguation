Acoustic invasion: How invasive species can impact native species acoustic niche?
The effects of invasive species on native taxa due to direct predation, food, and space competition, and disease transmission are well documented. However, the effects of acoustic invaders on animal communication have not been explored. We simulated an invasion of the acoustic niche by exposing calling native male white-banded tree frogs (Hypsiboas albomarginatus, harmonics at 60-1430 Hz and 2720-2780 Hz or 2280-2850 Hz) to recorded calls of the invasive American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus, frequencies from 90 to >4000 Hz) at a non-invaded site in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. In response, tree frogs immediately shifted calls to significantly higher frequencies. In the post-stimulus period, they continued to use higher frequencies and also decreased signal duration. Tree frogs did not change calling rate or inter-call interval. Acoustic signals are the primary basis of mate selection in many anurans, and such changes could negatively affect the reproductive success of native species. The effects of bullfrog vocalizations on acoustic communities are expected to be especially severe due to their broad frequency band, which masks the calls of multiple species simultaneously. These results show that invasive species could affect native species by interfering in their acoustic niche.
