The status of non-native bryozoans on the north coast of Ireland
A list of thirty-seven non-indigenous species (NIS) or cryptogens likely to appear on marinas or pontoons were targeted during a ten-day survey in 2012 on the north Irish coast. This included four bryozoan species. The non-targeted cryptogen, Bugulina fulva, was found for the first time in the Republic of Ireland. The bryozoans Bugula neritina and Watersipora subatra were found within Northern Ireland for the first time. The survey demonstrated that a rapid approach to sampling marinas and pontoons provides new range records of species likely to occur elsewhere within the region.
