Achieving effective outreach for invasive species: firewood case studies from 2005 to 2016
Invasive forest pests are damaging North American forests, and their intracontinental spread can be accelerated through the movement of infested firewood. We assessed the general public's awareness, attitudes, and perceptions of forest health issues and identified potential strategies for more effective delivery of information about invasive forest pests and firewood transport. We analyzed data obtained from five surveys conducted between 2005 and 2016 (n = 4,840). Awareness, choice of mode of information, and trusted messenger were predicted using linear regression models based on selected independent variables including age, race, gender, education level, and the participant's type of residential area. Overall, awareness regarding invasive forest pests was low among participants. Participants stated they would be most likely to pay attention to a flyer handed out when entering a state or national park or receiving an email after making a campsite reservation. State forestry agencies were the most believable source of information regarding forest health issues. For the modes of information listed on the survey, older participants and those with higher education levels were more likely to have greater awareness levels and to pay attention, while female and younger participants were more likely to indicate they believed the messengers. We conclude that awareness is key for modifying behavior related to firewood transport; as such, educational campaigns with effective messaging strategies could be a successful approach to reducing the movement of firewood by members of the public.
