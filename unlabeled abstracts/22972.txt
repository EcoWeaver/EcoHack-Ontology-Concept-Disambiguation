Lady Beetle (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae: Coccinellinae) Occurrences in Southeastern Missouri Agricultural Systems: Differences between 1966 and Present
Several species of lady beetles are of conservation concern due to the extirpation of some species from large areas of North America. Historical lady beetle specimens from New Madrid and Pemiscot Counties, Missouri were examined and compared to recent captures. Adalia bipunctata (L.), Anatis mali (Say), Anatis labiculata (Say), and Coccinella novemnotata Herbst were present historically, but have not been collected since 1970. Coccinella septempunctata L., Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), and Neoharmonia venusta (Melsheimer) are relative newcomers to the study area. The non-native species, C. septempunctata and H. axyridis, combined accounted for the majority of lady beetle captures within the study area during 2008 and 2009. The implications of the historical data with regard to these changes are discussed.
