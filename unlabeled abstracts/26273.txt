Comparing the effect of habitat on the magnitude of inbreeding depression in the Mediterranean native Senecio malacitanus and the alien S. inaequidens: consequences for invasive ability
We studied the effects of inbreeding depression and the level of self-compatibility on overall fitness parameters in the invasive species Senecio inaequidens DC. and the native Senecio malacitanus Huter, in plots with and without interspecific competition by natural vegetation. Competition had a stronger effect on fitness parmeters for both species, but it mostly affected the survival of S. malacitanus during the first year, and particularly the survival of individuals issued from inbred crosses. Inbreeding depression decreased the seed production in both species. Summer drought in the second year reduced the fitness of all inbreeding levels, masking the effect of inbreeding.The alien species had a shorter pre-reproductive time, a greater head production, and greater resistance to competition from established vegetation. In addition, a negative relationship was found between inbreeding coefficient and herbivory in the native species only. All these factors may help to explain the invasive ability of S. inaequidens. The magnitude of inbreeding depression and the environmental conditions can thus determine the success or failure of an invasion.
