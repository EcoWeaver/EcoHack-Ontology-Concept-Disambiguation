NEST PREDATION IN AN URBANIZING LANDSCAPE:THE ROLE OF EXOTIC SHRUBS
Nest predation is considered a primary force shaping avian communities, and landscape-scale features (e.g., amount of fragmentation) are generally recognized as factors mediating nest predation. These same landscape-scale features, however, may promote invasion by exotic plants, which may, in turn, increase risk of nest predation. We examined whether the use of exotic shrubs (Lonicera spp. and Rosa multiflora Thumb.) affected nest predation across 12 riparian forest sites along a rural-urban gradient (
