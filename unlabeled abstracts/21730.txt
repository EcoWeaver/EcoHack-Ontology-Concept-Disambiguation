Monitoring of the Topmouth Gudgeon, Pseudorasbora Parva (Actinopterygii: Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae) in a Small Upland Ciemiega River, Poland
INTRODUCTION The topmouth gudgeon, Pseudorasbora parva (Temminck et Schlegel, 1846) (known also as stone moroko), is a small cyprinid species native to Japan, China, Korea, and the Amur River basin, and it is a highly invasive fish species in Europe (Caiola and De Sostoa 2002, Pinder et al. 2005, Ekmekci and Kirankaya 2006). The species was introduced probably with stocking material of herbivorous fish, such as: grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella (Valenciennes, 1844); bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (Richardson, 1845); and silver carp, H. molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844) import-ed from China and it has spread in the last 40 years through almost the entire continent of Europe (Witkowski 1991a, b, 2006, Rosecchi et al. 2001, Gozlan et al. 2002, Copp et al. 2005, Pollux and Korosi 2006). The invasion success of P. parva can be explained by several of its biological attributes: physiological toler-ance, short generation time, high reproductive potential, feeding flexibility, and parental care (Adamek and Siddiqui 1997, Katano and Maekawa 1997, Rosecchi et al. 2001, Pollux et al. 2006).
