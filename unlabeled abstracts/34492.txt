Microbiome Variability across the Native and Invasive Ranges of the Ascidian Clavelina oblonga
Nonnative species destabilize coastal ecosystems and microbial symbionts may facilitate their spread by enhancing host survival and fitness. However, we know little of the microorganisms that live inside invasive species and whether they change as the host spreads to new areas. In this study, we investigated the microbial communities of an introduced ascidian ( Clavelina oblonga ) and tracked symbiont changes across locations within the host's native and invasive ranges. Ascidians in the invasive range had less-diverse microbiomes, as well as lower host haplotype diversity, suggesting that specific colonies reach new locations and carry select symbionts from native populations (i.e., founder effects). Further, ascidians in the invasive range hosted a different composition of symbionts, including microbes with the potential to aid in processes related to invasion success (e.g., nutrient cycling). We conclude that the putative functionality and observed flexibility of this introduced ascidian microbiome may represent an underappreciated factor in the successful establishment of nonnative species in new environments.
