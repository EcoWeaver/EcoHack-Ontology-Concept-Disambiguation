Using environmental DNA from sediment samples to detect invasive alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula) in an artificial pond
Abstract The early detection and assessment of aquatic species distribution is important in studying conservation and management. However, due to high costs and ineffective conventional methods, this is difficult in developing regions. Molecular genetic studies have led to advanced technology to allow researchers to monitor the presence of trace DNA levels found in the environment. In this study, we show that sediment can be used as an environmental DNA sample to detect the presence of an invasive species, the Alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula). Samples were processed directly using the FastDNA Spin Kit for soil, followed by other downstream applications, including PCR and sequencing. Amplified DNA fragments and sequence analysis revealed successful identification of the Alligator gar. Despite the environmental conditions, which tend to be warmer than typical eDNA samples, the high DNA concentrations in sediment samples allowed the reliable detection of this invasive species.
