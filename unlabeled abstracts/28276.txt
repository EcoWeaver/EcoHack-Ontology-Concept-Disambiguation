First Mediterranean record of Actaea savignii (H. Milne Edwards, 1834) (Crustacea: Decapoda: Brachyura: Xanthidae), an additional Erythraean alien crab
To date, the only alien xanthid crab recorded from the Mediterranean is Atergatis roseus (Ruppell, 1830). This species was first collected off Israel in 1961 and is now common along the Levantine coast. Recently a second alien xanthid species, Actaea savignii (H. Milne Edwards, 1834), was found off Israel and Turkey. A single adult specimen was collected in Haifa Bay in 2010, and two specimens were captured off Mersin, Turkey in 2011. Repeatedly reported from the Suez Canal since 1924, the record of the Levantine populations of A. savignii is a testament to the ongoing Erythraean invasion of the Mediterranean Sea.
