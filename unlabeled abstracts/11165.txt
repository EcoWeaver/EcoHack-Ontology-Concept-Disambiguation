Checklist of the terrestrial and freshwater arthropods of French Polynesia (Chelicerata; Myriapoda; Crustacea; Hexapoda)
An annotated checklist for the terrestrial and freshwater arthropods of French Polynesia is presented. Compiled with the help of 48 experts and based on published records, it comprises 3025 valid species names belonging to the classes of Hexapoda Blainville, 1816 (2556 species), Chelicerata Heymons, 1901 (36 7 species), Myriapoda Latreille, 1802 (22 species) and Crustacea Pennant, 1777 (80 species). Reported are 1841 taxa from the Society Islands, followed by the Marquesas Islands with 1198 taxa, the Austral Islands with 609 taxa, the Tuamotu Islands with 231 taxa and the Gambier Islands with 186 taxa. The specificity of this fauna and the analysis of each class and order are discussed. The level of endemism is particularly high, 61% of the known species, with non-native species representing 13% of the overall species count. The threats to the native fauna and flora of French Polynesia and particularly to endemic insect species are detailed.
