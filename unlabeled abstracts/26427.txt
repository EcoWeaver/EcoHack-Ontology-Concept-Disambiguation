Comparison of foliar terpenes between native and invasive Solidago gigantea
To test a defensive chemistry prediction of the Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) hypothesis, Solidago gigantea plants from North American and European (invasive) populations were grown in a screen-enclosed garden. Terpenes from 80 seed grown (dried leaves) and 320 rhizome propagated (moist leaves) individuals were confirmed by GC/MS and quantified by GC-FID. Native seed grown plants were found to have significantly greater diterpene concentrations than their European counterparts; foliar sesquiterpenes did not differ. The occurrence of specific sesquiterpenes and diterpenes was homogeneous across the two seed sources suggesting these biochemical pathways remain unchanged. Leaves from native rhizome propagated plants also had significantly greater monoterpene and diterpene concentrations; again sesquiterpene levels did not differ. Rhizome propagated plants exhibited significant population differences in monoterpene and diterpene concentrations. These data support the defensive chemistry predictions of the EICA hypotheses but cannot discount the role of possible founder effects in the invasive range.
