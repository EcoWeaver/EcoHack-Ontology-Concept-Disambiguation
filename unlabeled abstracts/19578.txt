Historical geography of pearl harvesting and current status of populations of freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera (L.) in the western part of Northern European Russia
This paper summarizes data on the occurrence of freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera in the western part of Northern European Russia adjacent to White Sea, Barents Sea, Onega Lake and Ladoga Lake basins. Also, this article provides an overview of the literature-based data and archive materials on the history of pearl harvesting. We include a list of rivers of Northwestern Russia, where pearls were harvested during the period of the sixteenth to twentieth centuries. The pearl mussel populations at the present time exist in at least 24 water streams in Northwestern Russia. Many of these populations are in high abundance and are able to reproduce normally. Data on the status of populations are given in this paper. Data indicate that the pearl mussel population in Russia contains[143.5 million individuals, but this estimation is certainly undervalued. Timber floating (timber floating is the transport of timber on waterways), hydro-engineering construction, pollution of rivers by industrial wastes and introduction of alien species, as well as a reduction in host fish species numbers can all be cited as the main factors that transformed the ecosystems inhabited by pearl mussel of Northern Russia. In addition, methods used in the Russian Federation for decreasing the anthropogenic load on pearl mussel populations were considered.
