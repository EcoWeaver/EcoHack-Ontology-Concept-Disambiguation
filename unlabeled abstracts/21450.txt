Variability in response of four populations of Amblyseius largoensis (Acari: Phytoseiidae) to Raoiella indica (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) and Tetranychus gloveri (Acari: Tetranychidae) eggs and larvae
Raoiella indica (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) is a phytophagous mite that recently invaded the Neotropical region. A predatory mite Amblyseius largoensis (Acari: Phytoseiidae) has been found associated with R. indica in Florida. This study evaluated A. largoensis by determining its likelihood of consuming eggs and larvae of R. indica and Tetranychus gloveri (Acari: Tetranychidae) under no-choice and choice conditions. To detect variations in the response of A. largoensis to R. indica, four populations of predators were examined: (1) predators reared exclusively on R. indica in the laboratory for 2years, (2) predators reared on T. gloveri in the laboratory for 2months but reared on R. indica for 2years previously, (3) predators collected from a field infested with R. indica, and (4) predators collected from a field that had never been infested with R. indica. Results of this study suggest that A. largoensis is likely to accept and consume high numbers of R. indica eggs regardless of their previous feeding experience. In contrast, all populations consumed relatively fewer R. indica larvae than the other prey tested. Predators previously exposed to R. indica were more likely to consume R. indica larvae. By contrast, predators not previously exposed to R. indica showed the lowest likelihood of choosing to feed on this prey item. Plasticity in the response of A. largoensis to R. indica larvae could be associated to selection, learning, or a combination of both. The possible implications of the observed differences in terms of biological control of R. indica are discussed.
