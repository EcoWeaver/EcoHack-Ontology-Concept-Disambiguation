Localized production of phytoalexins by peanut (Arachis hypogaea) kernels in response to invasion by Aspergillus species.
Peanuts respond to fungal infection by synthesizing phytoalexins, most of which are antibiotic stilbenes. The mechanism and dynamics of phytoalexin formation in the peanut have not been studied. One of the most popular peanut cultivars in the southeastern United States, Georgia Green, was investigated for its ability to produce phytoalexins in response to infection by soil fungal strains. The experimental design allowed for study of phytoalexin production in peanut kernels layer-by-layer. The layers were dissected from different depths of the kernel starting from the infected area down to healthier tissues. Six peanut phytoalexins, trans-resveratrol, trans-arachidin-1, trans-arachidin-2, trans-arachidin-3, trans-3-isopentadienyl-4,3',5'-trihydroxystilbene, and SB-1, were detected in the kernel slices and quantitated. All of the fungal strains triggered phytoalexin production; however, the composition of phytoalexins varied significantly by layer. After incubation for 24 h, tissues remote from the infected area produced almost exclusively trans-resveratrol, whereas closer to the infected area tissues synthesized all six phytoalexins. In all of the experiments, after 48 h of fungal growth, deeper layers produced all tested phytoalexins. There was a significant difference in phytoalexin production elicited by some fungal isolates. No association was observed between phytoalexin production and toxigenic potential of fungal strains that elicited the production in mature peanut kernels.
