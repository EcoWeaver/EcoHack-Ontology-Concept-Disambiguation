The chemical ecology of crucifers and their fungal pathogens: boosting plant defenses and inhibiting pathogen invasion
Fungal plant diseases can cause very substantial yield losses in crucifer crops such as rapeseed and canola, or vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli. To devise sustainable methods to prevent and deter crucifer pathogens, the chemical interaction between crucifers and their fungi is under intense investigation. Crucifers produce complex blends of secondary metabolites with diverse ecological roles that include protection against microbial pathogens and other pests. The secondary metabolites involved in crucifer defense, namely phytoalexins and phytoanticipins, and their metabolism by fungal pathogens indicate that some fungi produce different enzymes to detoxify these metabolites and that some fungal detoxifying enzymes are rather specific. Chemical synthesis and screening of phytoalexin analogue libraries using cultures of fungal pathogens, as well as protein extracts, have shown that such detoxification reactions can be inhibited and that some inhibitors are strongly antifungal. Overall results of current work show the feasibility of using selective inhibitors of fungal detoxifying enzymes, i.e., paldoxins, to protect plants by boosting their chemical defenses.
