Predation ability of freshwater crabs: age and prey-specific differences inTrichodactylus borellianus(Brachyura: Trichodactylidae)
Freshwater crabs are rarely represented in food webs and their role in these ecosystems has been largely ignored. Trichodactylus borellianus is an omnivorous crab species that has a diverse natural trophic spectrum. This paper evaluates, in a laboratory assay, the ability of three ages of this crab to prey on three different organisms. The prey selectivity and relative importance of each prey item was also analyzed. Prey items (cladocerans, oligochaetes, and golden mussels) consisted of organisms of different shapes and mobility, representing the natural diet of this crab. Crabs were sorted according to size (juvenile, sub-adult, and adult) and increasing amounts of one prey was offered to each crab after 24 hrs of starvation. In the selectivity trial, all prey types were offered in a fixed set. Crabs in all three age categories were able to prey on all organisms. Cladocerans and oligochaetes were consumed in greater quantities compared to golden mussels when offered separately. However, only the consumption of oligochaetes exhibited a positive correlation with the crabs' size. When cladocerans and oligochaetes were offered together, more oligochaetes were consumed, both as percentage of volume and occurrence. Age-specific changes in consumption could be related to differences in the stomach capacity of the crab, the digestion time of each prey, and the predator-prey encounter probability. The selection of the most elongated prey with the lowest mobility indicated that the balance of the gain and loss of energy made it an advantageous species to prey on, as it was susceptible to predation. Additionally, the mussel, which is an invasive species, although not positively selected by T. borellianus in the present study, represented a new trophic resource for this crab.
