Drivers of alien species composition in bird markets across the world
The global pet trade is a major pathway for the introduction of invasive alien species. The composition of species selected for transport is driven by market demands, which may be influenced by a combination of both historical and cultural factors. We compared Eastern (Taiwan) and Western (Australia and the Iberian Peninsula) bird markets to explore factors associated with the species composition and geographic origin of the birds for sale. We used a bespoke randomization test to compare species composition, geographic origins, and species overlap at different taxonomic levels among bird markets across countries. Alien species identified in the study accounted for more than 10% of the world's bird species. Parrots and songbirds were the most common alien bird taxa traded across all markets. In both Iberian and Australian markets, there was a strong bias toward parrots, waxbills, gamebirds, and finches. In Taiwan, species traded more than expected were parrots, waxbills, starlings, and leafbirds. Neotropical species were the most traded group in the three markets. Afrotropical species were also traded more than expected in Iberian and Australian markets, while the Taiwanese traded more alien species from neighboring Asian regions. The bird trade focuses on the same few bird groups worldwide. The composition and origin of species preferred in the Western markets may be influenced by colonial histories, cultural similarity, and strict regulations on wildlife importation, while species preferences in Eastern markets are strongly influenced by regional culture and proximity. Propagule pressure is a dominant factor influencing the success of biological invasions; it is important to recognize differences in the composition of bird markets among regions because they can translate into different invasion risks, among other factors.
