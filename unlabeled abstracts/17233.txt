The westernmost locality of Macrosciadium alatum (Apiaceae) in Europe and a new diagnostic feature of the species
A new locality of Macrosciadium alatum in the Western Bieszczady Mts. (Duszatyn, Koma?cza district, Sanok county) is described in this paper. The locality is currently the westernmost point of distribution of the species. As Macrosciadium alatum is an invasive species, it is advisable to monitor it cyclically in this area. A newly discovered diagnostic feature of this species, not included in descriptions of this plant so far, is conically elongated cells, i.e. papillae on the upper side of the petals. It is suggested that this feature be used in the identification of representatives of the Apiaceae family in Poland and Europe. The distribution map of the species has been updated in this work.
