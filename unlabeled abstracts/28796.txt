Activity of Bacillus thuringiensis Against Pryeria sinica (Lepidoptera: Zygaenidae), an Invasive Pest of Euonymus2
Pryeria sinica Moore (Lepidoptera: Zygaenidae), an invasive pest of Euonymus, is susceptible in the second instar to the Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner product Thuricide(r)and to several strains isolated from other B. thuringiensis products. Third instars are also susceptible, whereas susceptibility declines in the fourth (last) instar. The susceptibility of second-instar P. sinica to B. thuringiensis is comparable to that of second-instar gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), a pest commonly controlled with B. thuringiensis. Pryeria sinica, thus, should also be controllable with B. thuringiensis. Pryeria sinica, Euonymus, Bacillus thuringiensis.
