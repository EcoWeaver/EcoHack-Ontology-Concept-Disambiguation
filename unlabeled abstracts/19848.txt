Biomass functions for the two alien tree species Prunus serotina Ehrh. and Robinia pseudoacacia L. in floodplain forests of Northern Italy
As one cause for biodiversity loss, invasive alien species are a worldwide threat. In forests, however, invasive tree species can also have an enormous biomass potential which can be harvested while taking measures against the species. Allometric equations help estimating the biomass but are often only available for the native range of the species. This lack on information complicates the management of invaded stands, and the equations presented here should help fill this gap. The above-ground biomass for single trees of black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) in Ticino/Italy was estimated with differing explanatory variables as total, stem, crown, and leaf biomass. Regression equations of P. serotina were compared with equations from North America. The methods to derive biomass estimates from fresh weight and volumetric measurements in combination with wood densities were critically examined. The biomass could be estimated well by using ''diameter'' as explanatory variable. The productivity of P. serotina was lower here compared to its range of origin. Biomass estimates from volumetric measurements combined with the truncated cone formula have lead to systematic overestimations. Also the use of volumetric measurements combined with wood density measurements has overestimated comparable estimates from fresh weight measurements.
