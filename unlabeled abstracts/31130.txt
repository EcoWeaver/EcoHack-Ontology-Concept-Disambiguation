Protecting the Wildlife from Introduced Predators
This chapter describes the arrival in Pureora Forest Park (PFP) of introduced predators (especially rats and stoats); the research by the Forest Bird Research Group during the logging moratorium; the effects of introduced predators on native fauna; the intense research work that finally identified the key causes of the decline in kokako; and the healing effects of systematic predator control work in kokako habitat.
