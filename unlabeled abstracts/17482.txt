Dynamic coexistence in a three-species competition-diffusion system
From the viewpoint of competitor-mediated coexistence, it is important to study the influence of an exotic species on other native species in terms of exogenous effects, in general, exotic species are weaker than native ones because they have evolved in a different environment. Even if an exotic species is weaker, however, it might cooperate with a native species, after which the competitive relations among native species may have reversed. This motivates us to consider the ecological situation whereby one exotic competing species invades the native system of two strongly competing species. Therefore, we discuss the problem of competitive exclusion or competitor-mediated coexistence using a three-species competition-diffusion system.
