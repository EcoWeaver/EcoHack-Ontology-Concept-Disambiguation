Isolation and characterization of the first microsatellite loci from the order Psocoptera in the economically important pest insect Liposcelis decolor (Pearman) and cross-species amplification
A total of 11 microsatellite loci from the invasive insect pest Liposcelis decolor were isolated and characterized of which six loci were polymorphic. A population survey involving a total of 30-192 individuals per locus from five populations revealed a range of four to seven alleles per locus and moderate observed heterozygosities (0.183-0.565), highlighting the utility of these loci in further population genetic studies. Cross-species amplifications were successful for two to 11 loci in five other Liposcelis species also of international economic importance.
