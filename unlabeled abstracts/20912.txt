Selection Dynamics in Native and Introduced Persicaria Species
Plant invasions represent natural experiments that allow us to both explore the dynamics of natural selection in the wild and examine the evolution of an invader on contemporary timescales. We conducted a study of 10 natural populations of two invasive species (Persicaria lapathifolia and Persicaria cespitosa) and one native species ( Persicaria pensylvanica) to quantify the amount of natural selection acting on these species to compare the selection dynamics to which each is exposed. We also conducted a germination trial to compare the potential for invasion determined by germination rate. A Lande-Arnold-style multiple regression selection analysis was performed on five morphological traits ( height, stem diameter, leaf number, leaf shape, and leaf area) using flower number as our fitness proxy. Most selection was indirect and caused by correlations with other traits under selection. However, there was significant direct selection for increased leaf number in both natives and invasives and for thicker stems in just the invasives. The germination test showed that not only do the invasive plants have a significantly higher germination rate (>60% compared with 3% for the noninvasives) but they also germinate significantly faster; both findings have large implications for the ability of these two invasive species to spread.
