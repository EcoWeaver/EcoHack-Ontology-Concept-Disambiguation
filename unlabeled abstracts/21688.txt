Tinocallis kahawaluokalani (Kirkaldy, 1907)(Hemiptera, Aphididae): A new invasive species in Bulgaria
UDC 595.751(497.2):591.9 SHORT REVIEW ARTICLE Tinocallis kahawaluokalani (Kirkaldy, 1907) (Crape myrtle aphid) belongs to the family Aphididae, sub-family Drepanosiphinae, tribus Phyllaphidini. Syno-nyms of the species are Monellia lagerstroemiae Taka-hashi, 1920; Sarucallis lythrae Shinji, 1922, Sarucallis kahawaluokalani (Kirkaldy, 1907). Tinocallis kaha-waluokalani was detected for the first time in Bul-garia in a greenhouse in Ravda (located nearby Black Sea) at the end of May and early in June in 2009, on rooted cuttings from Lagerstroemia indica (L.) Pers. (Lythraceae). The cuttings were collected from plants grown in green areas in Ravda and Bourgas. Dense colonies of larvae, nymphae and winged females have been registered on the hind side of infested leaves lo-cated mainly on the top part of the plants. 238 plants were been infested, which is more then 80% of all La-gerstroemia rooted plants. The damage was detected on leaves, such as yellowing and premature leaf loss from plant. The same species was also found next year at the same location at the beginning of June. Winged viviparous females reach lengths from 1.02 to 1.8 mm. They are pale yellow with dark brown markings on the head and prothorax. The antennae are 6-segmented, the processus terminalis is less than 1.5 times as long as the base of the sixth antennal seg-ment. Paired tubercles on the tergum of the first and second abdominal segments and dark veins on the forewings are very distinctively marked (Fig. 1) and easily identified. Tinocallis kahawaluokalani is a monoecious and holocyclic species, producing oviparous female and alate males in autumn (Blackman & Eastop, 1994). Its native origin are the temperate regions of Asia - Japan, Korea, Formosa, China, and the Philip-pines. It is also distributed in Hawaii, North Amer-ica (Higuchi, 1972), Honduras (Evans and Halbert 2007) and Europe. For the first time in Europe, it was reported in Italy by Patti (1984) and later in France (Leclant and Renoust, 1986), Spain (Mier Durante et al., 1995), Germany (Thieme and Eggers-Schumach-er, 2003) Greece (Tsisipis et al., 2007) and Montene-gro (Petrovic-Obradovic et al., 2010). Tinocallis kahawaluokalani often infests plants in ornamental nurseries and landscapes on under-side of leaves and is particularly attracted to a new growth. It causes an unattractive aesthetic appear-ance of its host due to the sooty mold on the hon-eydew, and can also cause the leaves of the infested plants to fall-off (Alverson & Allen 1992).
