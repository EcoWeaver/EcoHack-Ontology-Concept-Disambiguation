Atlas Florae Europaeae Notes 18. Synonymy and Distribution of Some Native and Alien Species of Cotoneaster (Rosaceae) in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus
Some corrections to the nomenclatural checklist of Cotoneaster (Rosaceae) in eastern Europe and the Caucasus are proposed. Cotoneaster uralensis B. Hylmo & J. Fryer is treated as a synonym of C. cinnabarinus Juz., and C. soczavianus Pojark. as a synonym of C. tomentosus (Aiton) Lindl. For the sake of stability, the established use of the name C. integerrimus Medik. is maintained according to the lectotype designated by B. Hylmo and contrary to the conserved type belonging to C. scandinavicus B. Hylmo. The name C. pyrenaicus Gand. is found applicable to C. integerrimus sensu Hylmo if the conservation is followed. Cotoneaster mamajevii Knjaz. and C. estiensis J. Fryer & B. Hylmo are reduced to the synonymy of C. integerrimus. The second-step lectotypes of C. antoninae Juz. and C. cinnabarinus Juz. are designated. Cotoneaster cinnabarinus is reported as new to the Tyumen Region of Russia and Siberia as a whole. Some records of casual and naturalised alien species of Cotoneaster in the European Russia are revised and corrected.
