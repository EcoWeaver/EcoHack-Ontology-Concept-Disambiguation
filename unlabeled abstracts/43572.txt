Length-length, length-weight relationship and condition factor of an ecological invader, Cyprinus carpio (Linneaus, 1758) from Manasbal Lake of Kashmir Himalaya, India
AbstractThe common carp Cyprinus carpiois a well-known invasive species. A total of472 specimens of C. carpio(8.6-35 cm,10.5-1000 g) were collectedfrom Manasbal Lake of Kashmir Himalayafor this studybetween March 2018 andFebruary 2020. Astrong correlation between the respective parameters of length-length and length-weight with rand R2values approaching to 1 in both. The regression analysis indicated negative allometric growth for both sexes. For female,bvalue ranged from 2.04 (in spring)to 2.80 (in summer)whereasfor male,it varied from1.99 (in spring)to2.99 (in summer). The value of Fulton's (K)and relative (Kn) condition factors weregreater than 1 in every season for both sexeswhichindicatedthat C. carpiopopulation in the Manasbal Lake is in a good health condition and the water quality parameters along with other respective factors are favourablefor successful thriving of this fish in the lake. The present study will be helpful to develop future strategies in terms ofsustainable management of invasive C. carpioin the Manasbal Lakeand similar water bodies.Keywords: Allometric growth; biological invasion; common carp; correlation coefficient; coefficient of deter-mination; management
