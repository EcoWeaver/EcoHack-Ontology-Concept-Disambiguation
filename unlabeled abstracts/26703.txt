Birds on novel island environments. A case study with the urban avifauna of Tenerife (Canary Islands)
We analyzed the variation in island bird communities of urban environments related to habitat characteristics, using regression/classification tree analyses. Data from field censuses in cities/towns representing the urban heterogeneity of the whole island were obtained in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). Urban bird abundance in Tenerife was negatively affected by altitude and the cover of dry Euphorbia shrubs and positively influenced by the height and cover of the tree layer. Species richness was negatively associated with building cover and positively related to tree height and altitude. Data from field censuses in Tenerife were compared with that of similar urban environments in the mainland (Madrid Province, central Spain). Species diversity was higher in the urban sample of Tenerife than in that of Madrid and the proportion of bird species from the regional pool captured by urban environments was higher in the island than in the mainland. Nine native species and three alien species were more abundant in island urban environments than in the continent (densities, at least, 100% higher), the converse occurring for only five species. At a biogeographic scale, we conclude that the avifauna of Tenerife Island is more prone to occupy a new artificial environment than the mainland bird fauna of central Spain.
