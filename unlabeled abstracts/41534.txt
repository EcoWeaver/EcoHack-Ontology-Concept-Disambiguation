A first inference of the phylogeography of the worldwide invader Xylosandrus compactus
Native to Southeastern Asia, the ambrosia beetle Xylosandrus compactus is invasive worldwide. Its invasion is favoured by its cryptic lifestyle, symbiosis with a fungus that facilitates a broad range of host plants, and predominant sib-mating reproduction. X. compactus invaded Africa more than a century ago and the Americas and Pacific Islands in the middle of the twentieth century. It was not detected in Europe before 2011, when it was first reported in Italy before quickly spreading to France, Greece and Spain. Despite the negative environmental, agricultural and economic consequences of the invasion of X. compactus, its invasion history and main pathways remain poorly documented. We used COI and RAD sequencing to (i) characterise the worldwide genetic structure of the species, (ii) disentangle the origin(s) of the non-native populations on the three invaded continents and (iii) analyse the genetic diversity and pathways within each invaded region. Three mitochondrial lineages were identified in the native range. Populations invading Europe and the American-Pacific region originated from the first lineage and were only slightly genetically differentiated at nuclear SNP markers, suggesting independent introductions from close sources in or near Shanghai, ca. 60 years apart. Populations invading Africa originated from the second lineage, likely from India or Vietnam.
