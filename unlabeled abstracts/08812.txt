Exotic longhorn beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) established in New Zealand
Over the past 175 years, 10 species of exotic longhorn beetles have become established in New Zealand. Despite considerable increases in travel and transport of goods and materials throughout this time, the rate of establishment of exotic longhorn beetles in New Zealand shows no associated pattern. What is notable, although not surprising, is the high percentage of species that originate from Australia. These are mostly Eucalyptus feeders, which are presented with ample resources in New Zealand. These 10 Cerambycidae species are presented and discussed.
