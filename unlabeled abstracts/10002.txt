Effect of exotic mammalian predators on parasites of Cory's shearwater: ecological effect on population health and breeding success
Predator activity around the nests induces stress in breeding birds, which may have weaker immunity and are therefore more susceptible to parasite infections. The influence of predators on parasites has only been observed in land birds, and most studies are experimental. As seabird colonies offer excellent conditions for parasites, here we assess the influence of mouse, rat, and cat activity on parasites in Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis). Adults were examined for blood parasites and one adult and the juvenile from 53 nests were inspected for ectoparasites over two consecutive years (2010 and 2011). Nests differed in their physical characteristics and indices of mammal predator activity and were checked weekly to assess breeding success. Our results showed absence of blood parasites. Among the environmental factors, predator pressure received the most support (89 %) from the data as influencing nest ectoparasite intensity. Birds most infected had worse body condition, and breeding success was negatively influenced by predator activity and ectoparasite intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the interaction between mammal predators and ectoparasites in seabird species and supports greater protection through eradication efforts. In addition, we provide the first data on the endoparasite fauna of Cory's shearwater.
