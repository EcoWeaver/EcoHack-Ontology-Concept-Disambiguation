Frequency of Buddleja davidii Franch. (Buddlejaceae) in Germany along ecological gradients
In Central Europe as in most other temperate regions of the world, Buddleja davidii has become a very successful invader. A thorough observation, documentation and analysis of the spread of invasive species is the precondition for the understanding of invasion processes. Therefore, I documented the occurrence of the species along a west-east transect as well as an altitudinal transect, and I tried to reconstruct the spread of the species in the course of the last decades along railroad areas, which have proved to be the most favorized habitats for colonization of Buddleja. Additionally, a literature review is given on its general spread and distribution in Germany. Based on the investigation of 52 stations, the results show that the species, in Germany, has its optimum in the Rhein-Ruhr- and the Rhein-Main-area, that its abundance significantly decreases from west to east and with increasing altitude. A literature review combined with own investigations shows, that it was very successful in Germany on ruins of World War II but decreased and sometimes totally disappeared in cities of East Germany and of the altitudinal higher regions of Germany, i.e. also in many towns of South Germany. In West Germany, the recent spread started about three decades ago and is still in process. As cold winters seem to be the limiting factor for the spread of Buddleja, even an accelerated spread of this species and perhaps a loss of its ruderal character can be expected, considering the progress of climate change.
