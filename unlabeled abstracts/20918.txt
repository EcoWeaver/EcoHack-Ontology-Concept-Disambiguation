Occurrence of the first non-indigenous ascidian Phallusia nigra Savigny, 1816 (Tunicata: Ascidiacea) in Greek waters
The ascidian Phallusia nigra is listed among the non-indigenous species of the Mediterranean Sea and its first occurrence in Hellenic waters is noted here. The westward expansion of the black sea squirt from the north Levantine coast, up to the Aegean Sea has been revealed by scuba diving, as established populations were recorded offshore and in one of the harbours of Rhodes Island. Maintenance conditions of the species in captivity are briefly discussed.
