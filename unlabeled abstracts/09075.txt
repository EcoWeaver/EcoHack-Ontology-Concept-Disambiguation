Environmental forestry in Hong Kong: 1871-1997
Hong Kong may be the earliest tropical example of large-scale afforestation for environmental reasons. From the 1870s to the present, the reforestation of Hong Kong's tree-less hills has been a constant concern of successive governments. The major justification for this policy, however, has shifted: from health and aesthetic reasons in the 19th century, controlling soil erosion and improving water supplies for most of this century, to the current interest in ecological restoration. Despite periodic optimism about potential economic benefits, forestry in Hong Kong has never been commercially viable. A wide range of native and exotic tree species has been tried but less than a dozen have been extensively planted with a high degree of success: the natives Pinus massoniana, Schima superba and Castanopsis fissa, and the exotics Acacia confusa, Lophostemon confertus, Pinus elliottii and four species of Eucalyptus. Pinus massoniana was by far the most important species until its recent virtual elimination by the pine wood nematode. Experience so far does not support recent optimism about direct planting of diverse native species and suggests that a nurse crop of exotic species may be necessary, at least on the more degraded sites.
