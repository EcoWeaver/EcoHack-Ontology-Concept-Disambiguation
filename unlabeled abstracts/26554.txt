The Roles of Competition and Disturbance in a Marine Invasion
Two hypotheses for the decline of native species are the superior exploitation of disturbance by exotic species and the competitive displacement of native species by their exotic counterparts. Theory predicts that functional similarity will increase the intensity of competition between native and invasive species. Ecologically important "foundation" species, Zostera marina and other seagrasses have globally declined during the past century. This study used transplant and vegetation removal experiments to test the hypotheses that disturbance and competitive interactions with an invasive congener (Z. japonica) are contributing to the decline of native Z. marina in the northeastern Pacific. Interspecific competition reduced Z. marina and Z. japonica above-ground biomass by 44 and 96%, respectively, relative to intraspecific competition. Disturbance substantially enhanced Z. japonica productivity and fitness, and concomitantly decreased Z. marina performance, effects that persisted two years following substratum disturbance. These results demonstrate that disturbance and competitive interactions with Z. japonica reduce Z. marina performance, and suggest that Z. japonica's success as an invasive species stems dually from its ability to persist in competition with Z. marina and its positive response to disturbance. These results highlight the importance of understanding the interconnected roles of species interactions and disturbance in the decline of seagrass habitats, and provide a rationale for amending conservation policy in Washington State. In the interest of conserving native eelgrass populations, the current policy of protecting both native and invasive Zostera spp. should be refined to differentiate between native and invader, and to rescind the protection of invasive eelgrass.
