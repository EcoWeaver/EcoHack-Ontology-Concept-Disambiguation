Trachyaphthona nigritaandTrachyaphthona sordida(Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) Rejected as Potential Biological Control Agents ofPaederia foetidaL. (Rubiaceae), an Invasive Weed in Hawaii and Florida
Trachyaphthona nigrita and Trachyaphthona sordida, 2 potential biological control agents of Paederia foetida L. (Rubiaceae), were collected from Japan and brought into quarantine for adult host specificity testing. Testing indicated that they fed significantly on Florida native plants in the tribe Spermacoceae, a different tribe from that to which the target weed Paederia foetida belongs (Paederieae). These beetles, therefore, lack the appropriate level of host specificity, and this eliminates them from further consideration as potential biological controls of Paederia foetida, skunk vine.
