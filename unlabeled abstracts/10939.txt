Japanese Honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) as an Invasive Species; History, Ecology, and Context
Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) was introduced outside of Asia in the early 19th century and is now invasive to varying degrees on every continent, except Anarctica, and many archipelagos. The basic ecology and life history of Japanese honeysuckle are well known and described here; however, research needs on the underlying causes of the voracity and subsequent ecological impacts of this species are many. Virtually all ecological experimentation with Japanese honeysuckle has been conducted in the southeastern U.S., thus more data are needed in other regions, particularly South America and Africa. Although Japanese honeysuckle is naturalized in many areas where it has been introduced, there still may be hope for the control of local infestations and its further spread in areas that have a fairly recent introduction history. Japanese honeysuckle may be secure throughout much of its introduced range, but land management principles that discourage its use and public education to prevent further dispersal are recommended strongly.
