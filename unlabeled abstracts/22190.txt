Isozyme diversity in some Canarian woody endemisms of the genus Echium L. (Boraginaceae)
Oceanic archipelagos are considered hot-spots of biodiversity because they harbor unique biota with a high level of endemicity. However, the endemic biodiversity of oceanic islands is very vulnerable to extinction. In recent decades, intensive exploitation of these territories and human-mediated introduction of alien species have posed unprecedented threats to the long-term survival of the endemic contingent. The very limited population genetic information available until now for the 28 Canarian endemic Echium taxa has hindered the development of conservation strategies for the ca. 25% of them that are under threat. In this paper, we analyze the levels and distribution of genetic isozyme diversity in 23 natural populations of three endangered endemics of restricted distribution (E. acanthocarpum, CR; E. onosmifolium ssp. spectabile, EN; and E. callithyrsum, VU), and two endemics of wide distribution and in principle free of threat (E. decaisnei and E. onosmifolium). Our results reveal high levels of genetic variability in all these taxa that have plausibly been reached despite a predominance of selfing. They also point out a high incidence of inbreeding in the reproductive dynamics of populations and suggest the potential value of hybridisation processes in shaping the genetic makeup of these species. Among-population differentiation, as estimated by Gst, and genetic distances within taxa are low overall, but they do support the current taxonomic separation between the two subspecies of E. onosmifolium and do not furnish evidence that the current status of the endangered species may be attributed to genetic factors. We use the genetic parameters to suggest some guidelines to help implement a conservation strategy of these taxa.
