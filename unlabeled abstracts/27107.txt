Self-incompatibility in Mikania micrantha in South China
Mikania micrantha is a successful invasive weed in many parts of the world, but we do not know how its mating system may have contributed to this. Therefore, its mating system was studied in an open M. micrantha population during the flowering seasons of 2004 and 2005. Pollen/ovule ratio was determined and pollination treatments were applied on entire inflorescences to estimate the seed/ovule ratio. The pollen/ovule ratio of M. micrantha was 4008, and seed/ovule ratio was 0.56 for open pollination and 0.0034 and 0.0038 for wind pollination and selfing respectively. These data indicate that the weed is self-incompatible and needs insect pollination.
