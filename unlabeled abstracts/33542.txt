Some remarks on parasitic infections of the invasive Neogobius spp. (Pisces) in the Hungarian reaches of the Danube River, with a description of Goussia szekelyi sp. n. (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae)
During a survey of the parasite fauna Neogobius spp., which only recently invaded Hungarian reaches of the Danube River upstream from Budapest, it was found that Neogobius melanostomus and N. fluviatilis had become common species. Neogobius kessleri was less frequent and the previously widespread Proterorhinus marmoratus was drastically reduced. The parasite fauna of the newcomer fish species was characterized by ubiquitous parasites of a wide host range, such as the trematode Nicolla skrjabini, the metacercariae of Metagonimus yokogawai and Apatemon cobitidis, the larval stages of the acanthocephalan Pomphorhynchus laevis and the nematode Rhaphidascaris acus, the glochidia of an Anodonta sp. (Mollusca) and the ciliophoran Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. The specific parasites of Neogobius spp. were represented by three intestinal coccidia: Eimeria daviesae, Goussia kessleri, and a new species described here as Goussia szekelyi sp. n. This survey showed that the rapid invasion of Ponto-Caspian gobies in the northern Danube caused important changes in the fish fauna composition of the Danube River and enriched the parasite fauna of Hungarian fishes.
