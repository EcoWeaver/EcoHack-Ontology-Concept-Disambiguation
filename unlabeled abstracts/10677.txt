First record of the Charru mussel Mytella charruana d'Orbignyi, 1846 (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) from Manila Bay, Luzon, Philippines
This study reports the presence of the Charru mussel Mytella charruana d'Orbignyi, 1846 (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) in Manila South Harbor, Manila Bay, Luzon Island, Philippines. In 2014, mussels previously identified as Mytilus spp. were reported in Manila Bay. The species was detected as part of an ecological dynamics study of previously-recorded marine non-indigenous mollusc species. DNA barcoding results suggest that the previously identified Mytilus are in fact Mytella charruana with an average identity match of 94%. The trends in abundance of Mytella during the 2014-2015 sampling season are described and the potential of this new species to become invasive and competitive with native Perna viridis (Linnaeus, 1758).
