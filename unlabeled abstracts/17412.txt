Colonization history of Metrioptera roeselii in northern Europe indicates human-mediated dispersal
The bush-cricket Metrioptera roeselii is an example of an insect which has expanded its indigenous range beyond expectations based on its natural dispersal potential. Understanding how species colonize new areas is vital for formulating effective species conservation programmes and managing invasive species. The aim of this research is to use mitochondrial sequence and microsatellite data to delineate the likely origin and dispersal pathways of M. roeselii in northern Europe. The well-known ecology of the species and the detailed colonization data make it a very suitable model species for addressing questions relating to invasiveness.
