"Words matter." A Response to Jorgensen's Treatment of Historic Range and Definitions of Reintroduction
According to Jorgensen, the definition of reintroductions is crucial to their proper implementation and she highlights a number of ambiguities in existing definitions, particu-larly associated with the concept of historic range. We could not agree more and have incorporated her sug-gested term of "indigenous range" rather than "historic range" into the current revision of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Guidelines for Reintroductions and other Conservation Translocations (in preparation by IUCN Species Survival Commission Rein-troduction and Invasive Species Specialist Groups). We also agree with Jorgensen's interpretation that reintro-ductions are not always necessitated by humans caus-ing the extirpation of species. However, we disagree with other aspects of Jorgensen's argument such as the cri-tique of Seddon, the interpretation of previous IUCN guidance documents, and the recommendation that the conservation community "rethink the basic definition of reintroduction" rather than moving toward other translocation-based interventions. With regard to the lat-ter point, we emphasize that reintroductions are part of a spectrum of translocations and to focus on reintroduc-tions alone would overlook the fact that introductions beyond a species' indigenous range are being attempted. The new revision of the IUCN guidelines incorporates the whole conservation translocation spectrum and aims to avoid the ambiguities of previous definitions highlighted by Jorgensen.
