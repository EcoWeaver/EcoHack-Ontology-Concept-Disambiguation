Ethological Aspects of Honeybee Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera, Apidae), Adaptation to Parasitic Mite Varroa Destructor (Mesostigmata, Varroidae) Invasion
Ethological Aspects of HoneybeeApis mellifera(Hymenoptera, Apidae), Adaptation to Parasitic MiteVarroa Destructor(Mesostigmata, Varroidae) InvasionSome ethological aspects ofA. melliferaLinnaeus, 1758 (Hymenoptera, Apidae), adaptation to parasiting the miteV. destructorAnderson et Trueman (Mesostigmata, Varroidae) are shown. The basic complexes of behaviour reactions, directed on a fight against the parasitic mites of bees brood at the genusApisare shown, their comparative efficiency under various conditions and evolutional perspective. Possibility of ethological adaptation of honey bee toV. destructorparasiting, direction of selection by this sign and influencing of human on parasitic-host system was discussed. An approach to the selection of bees with the purpose of resistanse to varroosis promoution is proposed.
