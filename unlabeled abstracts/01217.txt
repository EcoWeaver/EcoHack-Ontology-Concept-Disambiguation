Dynamics of an experimental microbial invasion
Significance Current models for biological invasions are predominantly based on macroorganisms. Few invasion model assumptions have been validated for microbial systems. Further research on microbial invasion dynamics is required to determine whether macrobial models are appropriate for microbes, as well as to understand present and future distributions of invasive microorganisms, particularly in the face of contemporary environmental changes. We studied the establishment of an invasive protist in natural microbial assemblages in replicate experimental microcosms and found that, under adequate environmental conditions, invasion success was determined by the number of invading propagules rather than resource availability and the diversity of the invaded communities. This study is among the first to test invasibility hypotheses using an actual invasive microbial species in natural communities.
