Distribution and ecology of the invasive species of woodlice Hyloniscus riparius (C. Koch, 1838) (Isopoda, Oniscidea, Trichoniscidae) in Russia
In the former Soviet Union, there are species in the woodlice fauna that extend their ranges. In particular, the number of registrations of Hyloniscus riparius, previously found in Kyiv, has risen to eight since the 1990s. In addition, all new findings were made to the east of the previous ones. The analysis of the participation of this species in the woodlice communities in Central Russia demonstrates that they reach the number of 54 ind./m2, constituting up to 99% of the total abundance of woodlice. The almost ubiquitous distribution of H. riparius in the territory under study can cause a displacement of the indigenous woodlice species, as well as a decline in soil biodiversity and stability of ecosystems in the long-term perspective.
