Interactive effects of habitat productivity and herbivore pressure on the evolution of anti-herbivore defense in invasive plant populations
The evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis predicts that plants released from natural enemies should evolve to become more invasive through a shift in resource allocation from defense to growth. Resource availability in the environment is widely regarded as a major determinant of defense investment and invasiveness, and thus should be incorporated into the conceptual framework of EICA. Analysis of a simple model from the optimal defense literature demonstrates that, in contrast to the EICA hypothesis, enemy release is neither sufficient nor necessary for evolution of reduced resistance among introduced plants when habitat productivity co-varies. In particular, if the invasive range is more nutrient-poor than the native range, there could be selection for more plant defenses even with enemy release.
