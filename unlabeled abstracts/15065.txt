Richness and zoogeography of ascidians (Tunicata: Ascidiacea) in eastern Canada
Managers and policymakers in eastern Canada embrace science-based management of nonindigenous species and may benefit from having comprehensive regional species checklists at subnational jurisdictional levels. In this paper, regional checklists provide an account of the richness of ascidians in eastern Canada. Records of 58 ascidians resulted from reviewing 108 published sources, accessing data from two online databases, and collecting some common indigenous ascidian specimens. Analysis comparing the similarity of species among nine regions indicates that there is greater similarity in species composition between contiguous regions than between noncontiguous regions and suggests that there are four zoogeographic clusters in eastern Canada. Our checklists can inform managers and policymakers of the diversity of the ascidian taxa and can minimize taxonomic uncertainties of established nonindigenous and prospective invading species, for example, by identifying indigenous species that are congeners of nonindigenous species. The maintenance of checklists can be a valuable tool for the management of nonindigenous species as baselines to estimate changes in richness and to document the invasion status of nonindigenous species over time. For example, more importance can be placed on the spread of nonindigenous ascidians from one zoogeographic cluster to another than spread within the same cluster.
