Invasive rainbow trout affect habitat use, feeding efficiency, and spatial organization of warpaint shiners
Rainbow trout have been introduced to six of the seven continents and currently are widely stocked for sport fishing. Despite their broad distribution, outside of New Zealand, little is known about the effects of rainbow trout on native species, especially fishes. We conducted experiments in an artificial stream to assess hypotheses that stocked rainbow trout significantly affected: (1) mesohabitat use, (2) foraging success, (3) social behavior, and (4) spatial organization of warpaint shiners (Luxilus coccogenis) a common native minnow found in southern Appalachian streams, with similar patterns of microhabitat use to rainbow trout. We replicated experiments at high and low natural densities (two and five warpaint shiners) and spring/fall (12 degC) and summer (17 degC) temperatures. Treatments included: (1) a control (five warpaint shiners), (2) trout (five warpaint shiners and one rainbow trout), (3) large fish control (five warpaint shiners and one river chub) and (4) density control (six warpaint shiners). The presence of rainbow trout produced a shift by warpaint shiners from pool mesohabitats to shallower, higher velocity habitats with more variable substrata, as well as reduced prey capture success, feeding efficiency, and distance from the front of the tank (i.e., warpaint shiners moved closer to food release points), and increased the distance to the additional fish (i.e., avoidance of the rainbow trout). Negative effects on foraging behaviors were stronger in 12 degC treatments. In a realistic stream flume the presence of rainbow trout produced effects that likely influenced individual fitness of warpaint shiners. The potential effects of stocking rainbow trout on native non-game fishes, such as warpaint shiners should be assessed when implementing or evaluating stocking programs.
