The distribution and ecological role of Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774) in a large and shallow reservoir
Invasive species can change ecosystem services, cause loss of biodiversity, alter biogeochemical processes, and significantly affect global economics. Corbicula fluminea is an invasive bivalve found globally in lotic and lentic systems. This study aimed to examine the distribution, density, and potential ecological effects of C. fluminea in Lake Seminole, a large shallow, polymictic reservoir in the S.E. USA by investigating: 1) the density and distribution of C. fluminea; 2) abiotic factors determining abundance; and 3) heavy metals and nutrients accumulating within whole body tissue. This study calculated C. fluminea abundance at 55 +- 29 (mean +- SD) per m2, leading to a reservoir-wide estimate of ~4.3 billion. Multivariate analysis showed water depth as the leading factor determining C. fluminea occurrence. Corbicula fluminea siphon large volumes of Lake Seminole potentially playing a role in benthic/pelagic biochemical coupling. Compared to surrounding sediments, C. fluminea whole body tissue had significantly greater concentrations of Zinc, Copper, and Phosphorus. Results show that C. fluminea can thrive in large, shallow reservoirs as well as provide linkages between pelagic and benthic environments.
