Species composition of alien invasive plants in Heilongjiang Province
The number of alien invasive plant species in Heilongjiang Province has increased in recent years due to frequent economic and cultural exchanges with the outside world. To understand the current status of invasive plants, we carried out field surveys for invasive plant species between June 2008 and October 2010. Integrating field and literature data, we compiled a checklist of 41 species of alien invasive plants from 35 genera and 17 families found in this region. Of them, 39 species (95.1%) are herbs. Compositae contains the largest number of species, i.e.12 species (29.3%). Further analysis showed that 22 species (53.7%) have a geographical origin in the Americas, and 14 species (34.2%) in Europe. In relation to introduction pathways, 40 species (97.6%) were intentionally or unintentionally introduced. Floristic analysis of the genera showed that the temperate element, containing 17 genera (68.0%), dominated among nine areal-types. Finally, we discuss the management, monitoring and control of these invasive species and suggest that a specific risk as-sessment system should be used in Heilongjiang Province.
