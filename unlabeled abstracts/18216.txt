Modification by an invasive ecosystem engineer shifts a wet prairie to a monotypic stand
At the landscape scale, ecosystem engi-neers are expected to increase species diversity; however, diversity could decline if the ecosystem engineer is over-abundant. Thus, invasive ecosystem engineers are expected to have strong impacts, due to their high abundances and novel disturbances. An invasive ecosystem engineer, the feral swine (Sus scrofa), is a species that creates intense soil distur-bances, altering soil and plant communities. In this study, we examine the effects of this invasive ecosys-tem engineer on experimental plant plots that had been protected for over a decade. Feral swine avoided recently burned plots and preferred plots with N addition. Rooted plots shifted from a bunchgrass dominated wet prairie to a monotypic stand of the native, Lachnanthes caroliana. Feral swine were also attracted to plots with existing patches of L. caroliana suggesting a potential positive feedback between swine activity and L. caroliana patch expansion that could result in an alternative state.
