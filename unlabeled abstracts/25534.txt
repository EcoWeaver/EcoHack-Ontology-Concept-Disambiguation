DISTRIBUTION OF INDIGENOUS AND NON-INDIGENOUS CRAYFISH POPULATIONS IN THE POITOU-CHARENTES REGION (FRANCE): EVOLUTION OVER THE PAST 25 YEARS
Subsequent surveys carried out from 1978 to 2003 demonstrated a high disappearance of Austropotamobius pallipes populations from the region and the alarming spread of non-indigenous species like Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus. Represented by 137 populations in 1978, A. pallipes is now almost completely restricted to only one department, with 45 populations recorded, representing a decrease of 68% of the population number in 25 years, with a loss of 40% of populations in the last 6 years. Most of the disappearances of crayfish are unexplained. For the 22 others, the main reasons of the disappearance of indigenous crayfish populations were due to (1) habitat destruction by channelisation, (2) decrease of water quality by use of agricultural chemicals, (3) the construction of ponds or lakes changing the physical and chemical parameters of brooks inhabited by indigenous crayfish, (4) the introduction of non-indigenous species, mainly P. leniusculus and recently (5) crayfish plague implicated and characterized in the disappearance of two populations, two additional ones being suspected. Introduced in 1978 in Vienne department, P. leniusculus has now been found in 28 locations. First record of P. clarkii was in 1988 in Charente-Maritime department; since it has spread in most of the hydrographic basin of this department.
