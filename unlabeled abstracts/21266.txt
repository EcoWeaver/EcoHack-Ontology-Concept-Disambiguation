Distribution and Conservation Standing of West Virginia Crayfishes
The diversity of crayfishes in West Virginia represents a transition between the species-rich southern Appalachian faunas and the depauperate crayfish diversity in the northeastern United States. Currently, 22 described species occur in the state, of which 6 are given S1 status, and 3 are introduced species. One species, Orconectes limosus (Spinycheek Crayfish) is considered extirpated within the past decade. Imperiled species include Cambarus veteranus (Big Sandy Crayfish), Cambarus elkensis (Elk River Crayfish), Cambarus longulus (Atlantic Slope Crayfish), and Cambarus nerterius (Greenbrier Cave Crayfish). Three species--O. virilis (Virile Crayfish), Orconectes rusticus (Rusty Crayfish), and Procambarus zonangulus (Southern White River Crawfish)--have introduced populations within the state. Procambarus acutus (White River Crawfish) occurs in bottomland forest along the Ohio River floodplain, and is considered native. Several undescribed taxa have been identified and currently are being described. A statewide survey was initiated in 2007 to document the current distribution and conservation status of crayfishes in West Virginia.
