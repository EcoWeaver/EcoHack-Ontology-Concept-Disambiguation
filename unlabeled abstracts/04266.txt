Something in the way you move: dispersal pathways affect invasion success
Biological invasions are caused by human-mediated extra-range dispersal and, unlike natural extra-range dispersal, are often the result of multiple introductions from multiple sources to multiple locations. The processes and opportunities that result in propagules moving from one area to another can be used more broadly to differentiate all types of extra-range dispersal. By examining key properties of dispersal pathways (notably propagule pressure, genetic diversity and the potential for simultaneous movement of coevolved species), the establishment and evolutionary trajectories of extra-range dispersal can be better understood. Moreover, elucidation of the mechanistic properties of dispersal pathways is crucial for scientists and managers who wish to assist, minimise or prevent future movements of organisms.
