Effects of Competition with Four Nonnative Salmonid Species on Atlantic Salmon from Three Populations
The presence of ecologically-similar non-native species may impede recovery efforts for native species. We assessed the survival and growth of juvenile Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar from three populations (LaHave, Sebago, and Saint-Jean) in the presence of four naturalized non-native salmonid competitors. These populations are being used for reintroduction efforts into Lake Ontario in North America, where Atlantic Salmon are extirpated. Juvenile Atlantic Salmon were placed into artificial stream tanks with combinations of juvenile Brown Trout S. trutta, Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha, and Coho Salmon O. kisutch. Survival of all three Atlantic Salmon populations was lower with Brown Trout, and the growth was lower with Brown Trout and in the multi-species treatment. In contrast, Atlantic Salmon survival and growth were not negatively impacted with Chinook Salmon, Rainbow Trout, and Coho Salmon. Atlantic Salmon were not chronically stressed and did not show a change in social status after 10 months in the artificial stream tanks based on measurements of circulating hormones. The results support the theory that differences in aggression and niche overlap can influence competitive outcomes. Our results suggest that tributaries with Brown Trout should be avoided during the reintroduction of Atlantic Salmon into Lake Ontario.
