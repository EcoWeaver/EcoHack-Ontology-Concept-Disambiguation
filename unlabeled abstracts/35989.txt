Introduced population of ring-necked parakeets Psittacula krameri in Madeira Island, Portugal - Call for early action
Alien invasive species are major drivers of ecological change worldwide, being especially detrimental in oceanic islands, where they constitute one of the greatest threats to the survival of native species. Ring-necked parakeets Psittacula krameri are popular pets and individuals escaped from captivity have formed multiple self-sustainable populations outside their native range. For over ten years, free-ranging ring-necked parakeets have regularly been observed in Madeira Island (Portugal) and strong evidence suggests that they have breed multiple times in Funchal, the capital of the island. Herein, we assess the current status of Psittacula krameri in Madeira and discuss the possible ecological and economic impacts of established populations of this non-native parakeet. Given the initial stage of the incursion, we advocate for a "rapid response" intervention aimed at preventing the spread of this potential invader.
