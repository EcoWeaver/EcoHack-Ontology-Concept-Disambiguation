Four invasive alien phytophagous insects new to Armenia
In July 2019 four species of invasive alien phytophagous insects were recorded during the surveys of woody green spaces in Dilijan (Armenia): Cameraria ohridella Deschka et Dimic, 1986 (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), Obolodiplosis robiniae (Haldeman, 1847) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), Prociphilus (Meliarhizophagus) fraxinifolii (Riley, 1879) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and Euura tibialis Newman, 1837 (Hymenop-tera: Tenthredinidae). This is the first record of these species for Armenia, and for the latter two also the first record for Transcaucasia.
