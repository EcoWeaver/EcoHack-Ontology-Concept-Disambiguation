DEMOGRAPHIC PLASTICITY IN RELATION TO GROWTH AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION PATTERN IN ANTHEMIS COTULA -AN ALIEN INVASIVE SPECIES IN KASHMIR HIMALAYA, INDIA
The demographic study of Anthemis cotula L. revealed a protracted seedling recruitment pattern with peaks in autumn (pre-winter) and spring (post-winter). The major recruitment pulse in autumn contributes to the fecundity component of the life history while the minor recruitment pulse in spring aids in survival of the species. The total drymass accumulation shows striking variations between the pre-winter and post-winter populations. Compared to post-winter population, the pre-winter plants show higher drymass accumulation due to higher relative growth rate (RGR) and consequently higher number of seeds per plant. Allocation of dry matter to leaves was also higher. The present studies indicate that A. cotula tends to allocate a greater proportion of total biomass to above ground than to below ground parts which is characteristic of species invading disturbed habitats The extent of resource allocation to reproduction exhibited by the species is characteristic of the habitats that are less mature and are highly disturbed.
