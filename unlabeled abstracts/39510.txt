Influence of invasive shrubs and deer browsing on regeneration in temperate deciduous forests
While both chronic white-tailed deer overbrowsing and invasive shrubs have been linked to native regeneration failure in temperate hardwood forests, little is known of their relative importance and possible synergistic effects. Therefore, we established three study areas in Connecticut to examine the interaction of three levels of invasive shrub control and absence/presence of deer herbivory on forest regeneration over nine years. Five observations suggest obtaining forest regeneration requires a comprehensive management strategy. First, competitive interference by invasive shrubs in intact thickets continued to impede forest regeneration, especially taller seedlings, after deer were excluded. Second, density of small seedlings increased following removal of the competitive interference by invasive shrubs. Third, deer browsing depressed growth of small seedlings into taller height classes. Fourth, preferential browsing reduced species richness, especially in taller seedling classes, by favoring growth of low palatability species such as beech. Lastly, if a disturbance (e.g., cutting) does not kill the root system of the invasive shrubs, the window of forest regeneration recruitment may be narrow because invasive shrubs can quickly recover. In stands with both established shrub thickets and high deer densities, invasive shrub control and multi-year reduction of deer densities are both recommended to obtain adequate forest regeneration.
