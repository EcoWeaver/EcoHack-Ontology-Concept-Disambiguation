Arid land vegetation dynamics after a rare flooding event: influence of fire and grazing
Arid vegetation is subjected to more or less frequent fire, drought, and sporadic flooding events and grazing. Whilst fire, drought and grazing have been the subject of considerable research, little is known of the impact of flooding in arid environments. In this study we examined opportunistically the effects of a flooding event, and its interaction with fire and grazing on moulding arid vegetation in New South Wales, Australia. We assessed vegetation approximately 2 and 5 years after recession of the water in fenced and unfenced plots subjected to different combinations of flooding and fire. Number of species per area dropped from 11.8 to 5.7 per 625 m2. Vegetation in plots left open to grazing by vertebrates differed from fenced plots, but the amount of variation explained was small compared with flooding and the change over time. The taxa mostly associated with flooding were Eragrostis spp., Pseudognaphalium luteoalbum and the exotic Nicotiana glauca. Major flooding events not only trigger native species' germination and recruitment but may also create an avenue for exotic species to invade.
