Population genetic structure of the newly invasive Q biotype of Bemisia tabaci in Taiwan
The sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), is among the top 100 invasive pests in the world, and it causes serious agricultural damage and economic losses in many countries. More than 24 biotypes of the sweetpotato whitefly have been detected worldwide, of which the Q biotype has recently been reported to be a new invasive pest spreading throughout the world via trade in poinsettias, Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd. ex Klotzsch (Euphorbiaceae). In 2006, the Q biotype was first recorded in Taiwan in greenhouses, but not in the field, suggesting that the invasion of this biotype might be at an early stage in that country. The mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene and 12 microsatellite loci were used to investigate the genetic structure of multiple B. tabaci Q biotype populations. The presence of only a few COI haplotypes and a low number of nucleotide differences suggest high genetic similarity among these populations. Microsatellite analyses also revealed low genetic differentiation and frequent gene flow among greenhouses. The molecular evidence supports the occurrence of a recent genetic bottleneck in the B. tabaci Q biotype. Bayesian cluster analyses indicated that at least two invasion events have occurred in Taiwan. Phylogenetic analyses of microsatellites support Q biotype migration among greenhouses, which was likely facilitated by the frequent movement of poinsettias between greenhouses. Future management strategies should focus on developing plantlet trade regulations to avoid further anthropogenic dispersal of the B. tabaci Q biotype among greenhouses in Taiwan.
