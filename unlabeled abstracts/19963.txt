Alien scale insects (Hemiptera Coccoidea) in European and Mediterranean countries: the fate of new and old introductions
Abstract This contribution focuses on recent interceptions and introductions of alien scale insects and their current distribution in European and Mediterranean countries. Data and collections were gathered in markets, nurseries, and botanical gardens, mostly in Italy, either indoors or outdoors. New or recent records of the following alien species are presented: Exallomochlus hispidus (Morrison); Ferrisia virgata (Cockerell) (Pseudococcidae) ; Coccus viridis (Green); Milviscutulus mangiferae (Green) (Coccidae); Aonidiella orientalis (Newstead); Aspidiotus destructor Signoret; Aulacaspis tubercularis Newstead; Fiorinia fioriniae Targioni Tozzetti; Lepidosaphes pinnaeformis (Bouche); Pseudaulacaspis brimblecombei Williams (Diaspididae). New data and pest status of P h o e n i c o c o c c u s ma r l a t t i C o c k e r e l l (Phoenicococcidae) and Trabutina mannipara (Hemprich & Ehrenberg) (Pseudococcidae) are also reported. The possible repeated introductions of the latter from North Africa to south Italy by trans-Mediterranean winds, is hypothesized.
