Host manipulation of a freshwater crustacean (Gammarus roeseli) by an acanthocephalan parasite (Polymorphus minutus) in a biological invasion context
Several gammarid species serve as intermediate hosts for the acanthocephalan parasite Polymorphus minutus. This parasite influences gammarid behaviour in order to favour transmission to its ultimate host, generally a bird. We investigated this host manipulation in Gammarus roeseli, a gammarid species introduced in France 150 years ago which now coexists with several exotic species from different origins. In the field, vertical distribution of G. roeseli revealed a higher proportion of infected individuals close to the water's surface and the size distribution of infected gammarids revealed predation pressure on infected individuals. However, under laboratory conditions both infected and non-infected individuals remained benthic. The addition of a second gammarid, Dikerogammarus villosus, to the experimental device involved a vertical displacement of infected G. roeseli towards the water's surface. Dikerogammarus villosus, originating from the Ponto-Caspian basin, can be considered as an aggressive predator. The substitution of D. villosus with Atyaephyra desmarestii, a planktivore decapod, did not alter the gammarids' distribution, with both infected and uninfected G. roeseli staying benthic. Thus, biotic interactions between D. villosus and G. roeseli represent selective pressure encouraging the expression of manipulated behaviour in infected amphipods. Through manipulation, P. minutus was found to increase the survival of infected G. roeseli when faced with non-host predators and to make it more vulnerable to predation by the parasite's definitive host.
