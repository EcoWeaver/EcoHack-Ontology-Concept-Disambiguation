Evolutionary increase in sexual and clonal reproductive capacity during biological invasion in an aquatic plant Butomus umbellatus (Butomaceae)
To test the hypothesis that increased allocation to reproduction is selected during biological invasion, we compared germination, survival, growth, and reproduction of native vs. introduced populations of the invasive aquatic plant Butomus umbellatus in a common greenhouse environment. Although seedling emergence and establishment did not differ consistently, survival thereafter was twice as high for eight introduced North American than eight native European populations. As predicted, introduced plants were more likely to produce sexual inflorescences and clonal asexual vegetative bulbils, and they invested much more biomass in both reproductive modes. Higher reproductive investment was due to higher proportional allocation of biomass rather than larger plant size. These results are consistent with selection for increased reproduction during range expansion. However, population genetic surveys indicate that recruitment from seed rarely occurs in introduced populations. Hence increased sexual allocation is not an adaptive response to invasion. Although increased clonal reproduction may be advantageous in expanding populations, genetic evidence from introduced populations of B. umbellatus suggests that increased clonal allocation may have arisen via stochastic processes during long-distance transport or a selective filter right at introduction, rather than incremental natural selection during range expansion.
