Phymatolithon lamii (Hapalidiaceae, Corallinales, Rhodophyta): a first report for the Mediterranean Sea
Phymatolithon lamii (Hapalidiaceae, Corallinales, Rhodophyta) is reported for the fi rst time in the Mediterranean Sea. A morphological-anatomical account of Gulf of Trieste specimens is presented along with comparisons with P. lamii specimens from other regions, comparisons with other Mediterranean species of Phymatolithon and a dichotomous key to known Mediterranean species of Phymatolithon . Whether P. lamii occurs naturally in the Mediterranean Sea but was previously misidentifi ed as P. lenormandii or is, alternatively, an alien species, or both, has not been resolved.
