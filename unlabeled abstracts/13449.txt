A preliminary evaluation of the European Non-native Species in Aquaculture Risk Assessment Scheme applied to species listed on Annex IV of the EU Alien Species Regulation
Developed for carrying out risk assessments under the EC Council Regulation No 708/2007 concerning the Use of Alien and Locally-Absent Species in Aquaculture (ASR), the European Non-native Species in Aquaculture Risk Assessment Scheme (ENSARS) is summarised, and the Organism Module is applied to the 24 species listed in ASR's Annex IV. Four other ENSARS modules (Infectious agent, Facility, Pathway, Socio-economic) was used to assess two case study species (European catfish Silurus glanis, red-swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii). No Annex IV species was categorized as low risk, 10 were classed as moderately low risk, 12 as medium risk, two as moderately high risk and none as high risk. The results are discussed and recommendations on further development of the scheme as well as the need to have multiple assessors of multi-disciplinary expertise from the Member States concerned using an approach similar to that carried out by EU Reference Laboratory proficiency tests.
