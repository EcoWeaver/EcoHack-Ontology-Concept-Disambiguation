Open-access journal Aquatic Invasions: An important part of the developing European information and early warning system on invasive alien species
Ongoing economic globalization has resulted in accelerated rates of introductions of invasive alien species (IAS) in Europe and worldwide with deleterious consequences to biological diversity (Genovesi and Shine 2004; DAISIE 2009). The serious challenges posed by mass human-mediated introductions of invasive alien species induced the strengthening of inter-national cooperation in research, information exchange and management of invasive species during the last two decades, specifically targeting biological invasions in aquatic ecosystems (see Panov et al. 2002, Panov and Gollasch 2004, Gollasch 2007 for reviews).
