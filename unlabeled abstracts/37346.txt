First records of non-native species Malaysian prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (Decapoda: Palaemonidae) in an important South American hydrographic system
Abstract: Aim The objective of this work is to record the occurrence of non-native species Macrobrachiun rosenbergii in water bodies of the Piquiri River basin, State of Parana, Brazil, an important South American hydrographic system. Methods Samples were obtained from October 2015 to June 2016 and from September 2017 to September 2018, using traps and electric fishing equipment (portable alternating current generator, 2.5 kW, 400 V, 2A) in the Piquiri River and two tributaries. Results 16 M. rosenbergii specimens were caught, 11 females and 5 males. Conclusions Our results indicated the introduction of the species M. rosenbergii into the Piquiri River basin by aquaculture activity. The constant insertion of new specimens by the productive sector may, in the short term, maintain populations with large number of individuals, causing potential damage to the native biodiversity.
