Palatability of the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (Muller 1774) in an invaded system
Biotic interactions such as predation may influence the success of invasive alien species (IAS). Although the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea is recognized as one of the most problematic aquatic IAS, few studies have investigated its use as a food resource. In this study, we aimed to investigate (i) the palatability of C. fluminea under natural (Minho River) and laboratory conditions and (ii) if C. fluminea submitted to different conditions (individuals from Lima and Minho Rivers) vary in palatability. Soft tissues from different Corbicula populations, plus soft tissues from a native clam, tuna and Corbicula shell powder were offered to consumers. Field assayswere performed seasonally and laboratory assays only in summer; both assays also tested possible differences during distinct periods of the day. Overall, in natural conditions, the treatments containing C. fluminea had a low palatability. In laboratory assays, higher consumption (almost two times) was observed for Cyprinus carpio and Anguilla anguilla. Also, C. fluminea palatability was different between populations, with the treatment Corbicula Lima being more consumed than Corbicula Minho. Despite the low values of consumption in the field, laboratory results suggest that C. fluminea soft tissues can be a food resource to some species.
