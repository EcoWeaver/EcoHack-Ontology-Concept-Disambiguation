Explaining the explosion: modelling hybrid invasions
The emergence of hybrids between native and introduced species is an increasingly widespread problem which can alter entire ecosystems. We present a general model for the hybridization of two plant species to investigate the conditions under which hybrid invasions can occur, and the ecological and genetic consequences of such hybridizations. We find that parental compatibility and fecundity are important determinants of whether (and at what rate) hybrid genotypes emerge. Enhanced hybrid fitness traits affect both the population's genetic structure and total rate of increase, with rapid selection for the fittest genotype. Conversely, if different genotypes maximize different life-history characteristics, the ensuing population can be genetically very variable. The model provides a novel approach to evaluate the contributions of population dynamic and genetic processes in the study of hybrid invasions.
