Non-crop host plants of Tetranychus spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae) in the field in Okinawa, Japan: Determination of possible sources of pest species and inference on the cause of peculiar mite fauna on crops
The species composition of spider mites on crops in Okinawa is peculiar in that Tetranychus okinawanus and T piercei are dominant on most islands, whereas T urticae (green form) and T kanzawai are not. To determine the source plants of Tetranychus species infesting crops, as well as to contribute to our understanding of the cause of this peculiar mite fauna, we collected Tetranychus mites on non-crop plants throughout Okinawa (more than 450 sites on 15 islands) and identified them. Except in the case of T parakanzawai, the species frequently found on crops tended to occur frequently on non-crop plants, suggesting that the peculiar species composition on crops reflects that also on non-crop plants. T parakanzawai has been rarely found on crops but frequently found on particular non-crop plants, possibly due to the narrower host range of this species. The type of host plants varied among mite species; for example, T okinawanus was frequently found on indigenous plants inhabiting the seashore and invasive weeds, T piercei and T parakanzawai on inland indigenous plants, T urticae (green form) on invasive weeds, and T neocaledonicus on introduced trees. These results are of great significance when considering vegetation control as a tactic for the integrated management of spider mites.
