Tail breakage and predatory pressure upon two invasive snakes (Serpentes: Colubridae) at two islands in the Western Mediterranean
Tail breakage is an important anti-predator mechanism in snake populations, which can be used as a proxy for predation intensity as natural observations of predator-prey interactions are scarce. Frequency of tail breakage was calculated for two Iberian colubrids recently introduced in the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean, Spain): Hemorrhois hippocrepis (Linnaeus, 1758) in Eivissa and Zamenis scalaris (Schinz, 1812) in Formentera. The effect of sex, life-stage, dorsal coloration pattern, body length and body condition on frequency of tail breakage and on remaining subcaudal scale pairs (SBC) were analyzed and compared between the native range and the invaded islands. An increase of the frequency of tail breakage with body size was found, supporting a size-related effect, which also occurs in the native range. Frequency of tail breakage of H. hippocrepis was lower in Eivissa when compared with the original area, while in Formentera Z. scalaris showed a higher frequency, which could be related to the different predator community on each island compared with the mainland. The study of the main ecological aspects of these recent introduced species may allow to assess their potential impact on insular ecosystems and their native biodiversity as well as to promote future control actions in these areas previously free of snakes.
