Corallita (Antigonon leptopus): Intentional Introduction of a Plant with Documented Invasive Capability
AbstractCorallita (Antigonon leptopus) is a perennial vine, lauded as an ornamental for its vigorous growth, and plentiful (usually) pink flowers, and even its ability to smother unsightly landscapes. In the United States it thrives in horticultural zones 8 to 10, and also is successfully grown worldwide in tropical climates. When corallita is neglected, it can grow quickly over other vegetation, spreading beyond its area of introduction. Once established, it is difficult to eradicate because it produces many tuberous roots that can propagate vegetatively. Its fruits are buoyant, allowing for successful seed dispersal in water. The islands of Guam (South Pacific Ocean) and St. Eustatius (Caribbean Sea) represent two regions where corallita has become so pervasive that it threatens local diversity. In Florida, already it is classified as a Category II invasive. Our report reviews the literature and past studies of corallita, in addition to adding new taxonomic and distribution information from herbarium specimens to clarify the identity and geographic range. It is recommended that introductions of this plant by the horticultural industry in both tropical and temperate regions be closely monitored to prevent spread. On tropical island nations, we advise against any new introductions.
