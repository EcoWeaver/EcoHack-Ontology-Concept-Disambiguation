Establishment and abundance of a recently introduced mosquito species Ochlerotatus japonicus (Diptera: Culicidae) in the Southern Appalachians, USA.
Ochlerotatus (Finlaya) japonicus japonicus (Theobald; =Aedes japonicus; see Reinert 2000) (Diptera: Culicidae), is an introduced Asian mosquito species first detected in the northeastern United States in 1998. Since its initial discovery, this species has spread to many neighboring states and Canada. It was first identified in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia in 2003. Larval surveys were conducted during 2005 and 2006 in the Southern Appalachians, U.S.A., on a variety of natural and artificial containers to determine extent of Oc.japonicus establishment and larval habitat requirements. Detritus amounts were measured in each container habitat, and co-occurring larval mosquito species were examined as indicators of potential interspecific competition. Data reveal that Oc. japonicus was the most abundant container-inhabiting mosquito species in this survey. It exhibits flexibility in its use of container oviposition habitats, it can persist in a wide range of conditions, and it co-occurs with a wide range of larval mosquito species. Its rapid and successful establishment warrants continued monitoring, because its potential role as a nuisance species or arbovirus vector remains unknown.
