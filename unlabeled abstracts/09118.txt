[Role of biotic interactions on the growth of pre-recruitment and development of Pecten maximus (L.) in the Bay of Breast]
Biotic interactions within benthic megafauna were studied from quantitative dredge samples to investigate their role in the persistence of low scallop, Pecten maximus, stocks in the Bay of Brest. The distributions of 148 species of the megafauna and of four age classes of Pecten maximus were sampled. Suspension feeders dominate all megabenthic assemblages within the bay. This domination can be related to Crepidula fornicata spreading in the bay; however, no direct competition for food between scallops and the slipper limpet (introduced species) has been observed. On the other hand, Crepidula spreading leads to major changes in sediment type (silting) in the bay owing to biodeposit production, and silting would be a major factor inducing the decrease in Pecten maximus distribution. Predation would not be limiting. Within 10 years, one may predict a strong decrease in the area colonized by scallops in the bay.
