INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF PARASITES IN EXOTIC SUIS-LARGE WHITE (SUIDAE) SLAUGHTERED IN A TROPICAL URBAN ABATTOIR
Parasitic investigation was carried out to determine the incidence and prevalence of the parasites of exotic Suis (large white) slaughtered for meat in Nsukka, Nigeria. All the 180 large white examined were infected with either or both ecto- and endoparasites. The ecto-parasites were Sarcoptes suis and Haematopinus suis and endoparasites were Strongyloides ransomi, Eimeria sp and Ascaris suum. Among the endoparasites, Eimeria sp. had the highest prevalence (51.70%), followed by S. ransomi (41.10 %) and A. suum (31.10 %). S. suis (35.50%) was more prevalent than H. suis (6.60%). Incidence of the endoparasites was high being 142.60% of S. ransomi, 1350% of Eimeria sp. and 104.30% of A. suum. Incidence of S. suis was 146.40% and that of H. suis was 38.7%. The prevalence of haemoparasites encoun-tered during the survey were Trypanosoma brucei (10.00%) T. congolense, (13.30%) Babesia trautmanni (42.77%) and Babesia perroncitoi (33.89%) and the incidences of these parasites were 31.40, 45.00, 127.79 and 95.78%, respectively. Age groups 7-9 months were mostly affected by various ectoparasites except in the infection of H. suis which was recorded mostly in the young stock 4-6 months of age. Age groups 7-9 months were mostly affected by haemoparasites followed by above 9 months and lastly 4-6 months old pigs.
