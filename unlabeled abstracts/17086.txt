Invasion by Solidago species has limited impacts on soil seed bank communities
Increasing attention in invasion biology is being paid to measuring and understanding the impacts of invasive species. For plant invasions, however, the impact of invasion on soil seed bank communities has been under-studied. At six sites in southern Germany, we investigated whether areas invaded by Solidago gigantea and S. canadensis experienced a reduction in seed bank species richness, size and diversity, and a change in species composition compared to adjacent uninvaded areas. We found no overall effect of invasion on seed bank size, or on species richness and diversity. Seed bank size significantly decreased from 0-5 cm to 5-10 cm depth in both invaded and uninvaded areas. A significant amount of variation in species composition was explained by invasion, but it was only one-tenth of that explained solely by site effects. Our study suggests that invasion by Solidago species may not have the same impacts on the soil seed banks of native species as other invasive perennial forbs that have so far been studied.
