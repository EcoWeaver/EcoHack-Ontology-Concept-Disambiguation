Worldwide effects of non-native species on species-area relationships
Nonnative species have invaded most parts of the world and this process is expected to accelerate. As many naturalized nonnative species are likely to become permanent inhabitants, future species-area relationships (SARs) should consider nonnative species, either separately or jointly with native species. If nonnative species are occupying unused niches and space in invaded habitats and extinction rate of native species remains low (as seen in most cases, especially for plants), it is expected the resulting SARs that include both native and nonnative species would become stronger. Here, using published and newly compiled data (a total of 35 datasets worldwide), we examine how species invasions affect SARs across selected taxonomic groups and diverse habitats around the world. We found that, post-invasion SARs for all species (native plus nonnative) became stronger with degree of invasion (DI; measured as the proportion of nonnative species), thus indeed re-shaping SARs worldwide. Overall, native species still showed stronger and less variable SARs, with steeper slopes, than nonnative species. There is some discordance among different nonnative taxonomic groups in filling up their new niches (especially for birds) and between islands and mainland habitats. Re-examining the changing species-area curves may help predict the possibilities of future invasions and have practical implications for conservation management.
