Generalized regional spatial patterns of larval recruitment of invasive ascidians, mussels, and other organisms along the coast of Maine
Editor's note: This paper is a contribution to the proceedings of the 3rd International Invasive Sea Squirt Conference held in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA, on 26-28 April 2010. The conference provided a venue for the exchange of information on the biogeography, ecology, genetics, impacts, risk assessment and management of invasive tunicates worldwide. Abstract Along the coast of Maine, recruitment of most invasive marine ascidians follows a generalized regional pattern, with higher recruitment rates at western sites. Using artificial collectors we found that Botryllus schlosseri, Botrylloides violaceus, Ciona intestinalis, Ascidiella aspersa and Styela clava were more abundant in the western (southwestern) sites than in the eastern (northeastern) sites. This general pattern also applies to a number of other recruiting species including native mussels, Mytilus spp., and the invasive crab, Carcinus maenas. While recruitment of many marine organisms can appear stochastic in space, there can be some consistent regional patterns. Higher recruitment in the western sites of Maine may be the result of greater oceanographic dispersal due to the westward flow of the Maine coastal current, higher seawater temperatures in the west, and more anthropogenic introductions having occurred in the western harbors.
