Viability of culturing pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum in low-salinity groundwater from the Yucatan Peninsula (SE, Mexico)
In the Gulf of Mexico constraints linked to the supply of post-larvae (PL) and legal pressures associated with the introduction of a non-native species have been the motives behind research on the aquaculture of the native shrimp. In the present study, the growth and survival of 25-day-post-larvae (PL-25) of the pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum in saline groundwaters were evaluated. During the experiment the shrimps were acclimated from 36psu to 5psu utilizing various acclimation times (T1=38h, T2=42h, and T3=45h) with a variable rate of salinity reduction (T1=9.9%h-1, T2=11.8%h-1, and T3=11.4%h-1). After a 1-day acclimation period there were no differences (P>0.05) in survival between treatments (80.7+-3.5%). The salinity reduction rate of T1 (low acclimation time) was selected to acclimatize the PL for the nursery experiment due to the high survival rate recorded after the salinity stress test. During the nursery experiment, shrimp at a density of 80PLm-2 had the highest growth rate (20mgweek-1) (F(2,9)=10.73; P
