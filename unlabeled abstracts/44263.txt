The identification and remote detection of alien invasive plants in commercial forests: An Overview
Invasive alien plants are responsible for extensive economic and ecological damage in forest plantations. They have the ability to aggressively manipulate essential ecosystem structural and functional processes. Alterations in these processes can have detrimental effects on the growth and productivity of forest species and ultimately impact on the quality and quantity of forest wood material. Using direct sampling field-based methods or visual estimations have generally expressed moderate success owing to the logistical and timely impracticalities. Alternatively, remote sensing techniques offer a synoptic rapid approach for detecting and mapping weeds affecting plantation forest environments. This paper reviews remote sensing techniques that have been used in detecting the occurrence of weeds and the implications for detecting S. mauritianum (bugweed); one of the most notorious alien plant invaders to affect southern Africa. Gaining early control of these alien plant invasions would reduce the impacts that may permanently alter our forested ecosystems, contributing to its successful eradication and promoting sustainable forest management practices. Furthermore, the review highlights the difficulties and opportunities that are associated with weed identification using remote sensing and future directions of research are also proposed.
