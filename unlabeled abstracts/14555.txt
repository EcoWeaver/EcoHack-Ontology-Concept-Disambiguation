Port-by-port accumulations and dispersal of hull fouling invertebrates between the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean
The R/V Oceanus completed a 9,789 km, 28 day passage from Woods Hole, Massachusetts, in the Atlantic Ocean, through the Panama Canal to Yaquina Bay, Oregon, in the Pacific Ocean on 21 February 2012. The Oceanus had previously operated in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean (including the Caribbean Sea). We document the sequential acquisition of the barnacles Balanus trigonus and Amphibalanus venustus and the oyster Ostrea equestris on the Oceanus on its high and low latitude transoceanic, intra-oceanic, and inter-oceanic travels before she was surveyed in Yaquina Bay. The close correspondence between hull fouling accumulations and the detailed two year Oceanus working history reveals B. trigonus settlement occurred in every tropical port visited by the Oceanus, that some populations survived through two of three Woods Hole winters, and that some of these populations passed through the freshwater Panama Canal. These results suggest that marine hull-fouling species are continuously transported globally between most ports of call by most ship passages.
