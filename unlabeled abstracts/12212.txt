Preliminary Assessment of Biofouling on Offshore Mussel Farms
Biofouling is a significant operational problem for the aquaculture industry globally; however, options for on-farm management are limited. In New Zealand, the green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus, has historically been cultivated at inshore locations, but increased competition for space has led the industry to develop offshore farming sites several kilometers from the coast. We hypothesize that the distance to these farm sites from coastal locations, and their placement over extensive soft-sediment habitats, may provide a barrier to colonization by biofouling species with limited natural dispersal abilities. A study of two offshore mussel farms revealed that they supported relatively impoverished biofouling communities by comparison with inshore mussel farms and other artificial structures. Offshore sites had a relatively low number of taxa and a low prevalence of short-dispersing organisms such as ascidians, which are a problematic group of fouling organisms in aquaculture. We suggest that newly established offshore marine farms have the potential to be kept free of a range of problematic fouling organisms, provided the introduction of such species via human transport pathways can be mitigated.
