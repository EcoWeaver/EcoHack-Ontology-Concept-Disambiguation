Development and characterization of 13 new, and cross amplification of 3, polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci in the common myna (Acridotheres tristis)
We used a next generation sequencing (NGS) approach to screen for genome-wide nuclear microsatellite loci in the common (Indian) myna, Acridotheres tristis. In addition, markers previously developed for other Sturnidae species were tested for cross-amplification in A. tristis. In total, we identified 20 loci from NGS data and tested 26 loci for cross-amplification. Out of all loci (NGS developed and cross-amplified), 16 unlinked loci showed polymorphism, ranging from 2 to 9 alleles per locus. Test individuals were obtained from the invasive ranges of common myna in South Africa. Overall, expected and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0.089 to 0.802 and from 0.094 to 0.906, respectively. These markers will be used to shed light on invasion genetics and landscape-scale dynamics of invasive A. tristis in South Africa.
