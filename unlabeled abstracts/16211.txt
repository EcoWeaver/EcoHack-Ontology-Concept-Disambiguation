Parthenium hysterophorusin Nepal: a review of its weed status and possibilities for management
The rapid expansion of the alien invasive Parthenium hysterophorus is a new agricultural and environmental problem for Nepal. Although the weed was first recorded in 1967, the most significant expansion has occurred in the last 20 years. The weed is thought to have entered Nepal from India and currently is found in the Tarai, Siwalik and hill regions of Nepal. A CLIMEX modelling projection has shown these regions to be climatically suitable for the growth of P. hysterophorus, both under the present and a future projected increased temperature. From the initially invaded roadside vegetation, the weed has now spread into cropping land and forests. Vehicle movement and transportation of agriculture products are the main means by which its seed is spreading. The weed has reduced plant species richness and changed species composition in grasslands, while fodder collectors have developed contact dermatitis from the plant. To date, no sustainable management strategy has been developed for this weed. However, the fortuitous arrival of the biological control agents Zygogramma bicolorata and Puccinia abrupta var. partheniicola has had some impact upon the weed's growth and abundance. A CLIMEX modelling projection identifies many suitable locations for Z. bicolorata outside of its present range and within areas where the weed is likely to spread, both under the present and under a future projected climate of increased temperature. Mapping of the currently invaded areas, management through community involvement and further releases of new and redistribution of current biological control agents are required to manage P. hysterophorus in Nepal.
