Monitoring Invasive Species: Detecting Purple Loosestrife and Evaluating Biocontrol along the Niobrara River, Nebraska
Geospatial tools and techniques are playing important roles in determining the location and spatial extents of invasive species infestations and in evaluating the performances of various management activities aimed at controlling their spread. In this study, hyperspectral image processing techniques were used to map purple loosestrife and to assess the effectiveness of biological control agents in controlling its infestations along the Niobrara River in Nebraska. Validation based on field survey showed an overall map accuracy of 82.1% and comparison with in situ data on biocontrol release indicated that biocontrol agents were effective in the areas where they were released.
