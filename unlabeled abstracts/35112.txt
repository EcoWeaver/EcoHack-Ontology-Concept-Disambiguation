Soil seed bank depletion as a mechanism ofLantana camaraL. invasion
Lantana camara is an invasive plant in South Africa with a wide range of impacts. This study assessed the impact of L. camara invasion on the soil seed bank. The study asked the question, does species density and diversity of soil seed banks differ between L. camara invaded and uninvaded sites? The study was conducted over a 10-month period under greenhouse conditions using soils collected from five L. camara invaded and uninvaded sites that were located between Port Alfred and East London in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The study measured species density, diversity and identified seedlings that germinated in trays containing soils from invaded and uninvaded sites. Species density and diversity were lower in L. camara invaded sites compared with uninvaded sites, an indication that L. camara invasion has the potential to deplete the soil seed bank of other species. The study concluded that L. camara invasion reduces the soil seed bank community composition and structure.
