How to be an invasive gammarid (Amphipoda: Gammaroidea)-comparison of life history traits
About six life history and two ecological traits of gammarid species occurring in Central European waters were compared in order to identify the characters of successful invader. The species were (1) natives: Gammarus fossarum, G. pulex, G. lacustris, G. varsoviensis, G. balcanicus, G. leopoliensis, G. roeselii, and (2) aliens: Gammarus tigrinus, Chaetogammarus ischnus (=Echinogammarus ischnus), Pontogammarus robustoides, Obesogammarus crassus, Dikerogammarus haemobaphes, D. villosus. Generally the alien species were characterised by a combination of large brood size, high partial fecundity, early maturation and by appearance of higher number of generations per year. Also, these species presented higher tolerance towards severe environmental conditions, i.e. elevated salinity and human degradation of the environment. The above features seem to facilitate the colonisation of new areas and competition with native species -- a phenomenon that has been currently observed in various parts of Europe.
