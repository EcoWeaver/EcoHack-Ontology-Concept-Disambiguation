Effects of genotypic and phenotypic variation on establishment are important for conservation, invasion, and infection biology
Significance This paper provides a synthesis of results from experimental studies on plants and animals, and shows that there is strong evidence that genotypic and heritable phenotypic diversity improves establishment success and population persistence. An increased focus on among-individual variation may improve the success of conservation programs aiming to revitalize declining populations and species. Recognizing the role of diversity may also improve our ability to identify and ultimately prevent potential harmful invading species from spreading outside of their native ranges, and aid the development of means for improved protection against epizootics and epidemics.
