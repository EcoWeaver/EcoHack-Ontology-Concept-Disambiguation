Findings of the Invasive Species Acanthoscelides pallidipennis (Motschulsky, 1874) on Amorpha fruticosa L. in Primorsky Krai
Acanthoscelides pallidipennis, an invasive species from North America, was first observed in Primorsky krai on the introduced species Amorpha fruticosa. Among 26 inspected settlements where A. fruticosa was used for landscaping, 19 were found to be infested with seed beetle A. pallidipennis. This insect species was not detected earlier in Primorsky krai. The occurrence of the beetle is limited to the area located in the southwest of the region, close to the border between Russia and China, which indicates a possible pathway for invasion of this species.
