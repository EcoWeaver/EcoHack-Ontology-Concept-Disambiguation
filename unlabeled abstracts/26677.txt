Mile-a-Minute (Polygonum perfoliatum): An Increasingly Problematic Invasive Species1
Mile-a-minute (Polygonum perfoliatum L., POLPF) is an introduced annual vine from eastern Asia that has become a serious weed in the eastern United States (Jianquing et al. 2000; McCormick and Hartwig 1995; Mc- Cormick and Johnson 1997; Oliver 1996). This plant is considered an invasive noxious weed because its aggressive growth allows it to outcompete and displace native plants in many habitats (Okay 1997; Oliver and Coile 1994). It is feared that mile-a-minute could spread all the way to Florida where under warm, moist climatic conditions it may attain the status of a perennial weed (Stevens 1994). The possibility of this weed spreading from coast to coast has also been raised (Hartwig 1991; Oliver 1996). The objective of this paper is to review key aspects of the etymology, history, biology, impact, and management of mile-a-minute in natural and seminatural plant communities with the ultimate goal of increasing awareness of the threat posed by this species, and of stimulating research into the development of effective and economical management strategies.
