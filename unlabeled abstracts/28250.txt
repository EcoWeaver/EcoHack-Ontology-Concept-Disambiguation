Invasion dynamics of the European shore crab, Carcinus maenas, in Australia
In Australia and most other invaded locations, rates of range expansion by the European shore crab, Carcinus maenas, are typically only a few kilometres per year, despite a planktonic duration upwards of 50 days and off-shore larval development. This relatively static distribution is punctuated by rare episodes of long-distance and large-scale spread, some of which appear to be related to unusual oceanographic conditions and some of which are likely to be human assisted. These observations suggest, first, that long planktonic duration and off-shore development in a marine invertebrate does not preclude very localised recruitment, and, second, that this recruitment norm may be punctuated by brief episodes of wide scale mixing of propagules. Punctuated dispersal has previously been suggested to account for large-scale biogeographic patterns of distribution and speciation, but may also have implications for the processes that stabilise structured spatial metapopulations.
