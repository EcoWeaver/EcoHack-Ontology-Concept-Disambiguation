Distribution and Potential Range Expansion of Seven Introduced Ground Beetle Species (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in Quebec, Canada
Seven species of ground beetles, introduced into North America from Europe, were selected for a distribution study in the province of Quebec, Canada. Their distribution was determined with the specimens in three Canadian insect collections: the Lyman Entomological Museum (LEM), the Ouellet-Robert Collection at the Universite de Montreal (QMOR) and the Canadian National Collection in Ottawa (CNC). Current distributions were compared to that reported by Larochelle (1975). Harpalus affinis (Schrank), Agonum muelleri (Herbst), Clivina fossor L., Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) and Carabus nemoralis Muller have a similar distribution to what is reported by Larochelle (1975). Harpalus rufipes DeGeer has possibly expanded its range south from Gaspesie Region (eastern Quebec) or north from eastern United States towards Montreal. Bembidion obtusum Audinet-Serville has probably expanded its range from Ontario into southern Quebec.
