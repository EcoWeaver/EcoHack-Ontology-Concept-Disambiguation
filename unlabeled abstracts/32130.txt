Invasion of polluted soft substratum of Izmir Bay (Aegean Sea, eastern Mediterranean) by the spionid polychaete worm, Pseudopolydora paucibranchiata (Polychaeta: Spionidae)
The present study reports the first occurrence of an alien spionid polychete worm, Pseudopolydora paucibranchiata Okuda 1937, in the Mediterranean Sea. This species, which was previously identified as P. antennata Claparede, 1870, formed a dense population in and near Alsancak Harbor (Izmir Bay, Aegean Sea), especially in June 2004. It was also found at some stations in Iskenderun and Mersin Bays in September 2005 (Levantine Sea). The maximum density and biomass (wet weight: ww) of P. paucibranchiata in Izmir Bay were 6180 ind.m-2 and 4.77 g wwt.m-2, respectively. The seasonal fluctuations of density and biomass of the species were studied in Izmir Bay, indicating that its density and biomass values increased in spring and summer, and drastically diminished in fall and winter. This species is able to reproduce in the area both in winter, spring and summer. Its establishment in the area is most probably transport by ballast water. The morphological, ecological and distributional characteristics of the species as well as its impact on the prevailing ecosystem are analyzed and discussed.
