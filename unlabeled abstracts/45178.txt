Minimum Longevity and Growth of the Invasive Green Anole,<i>Anolis carolinensis</i>, in Chichi-jima of the Ogasawara Islands, Japan
We studied the longevity and growth pattern of the wild populations of invasive green anoles (Anolis carolinensis) in Chichi-jima Island, Japan. We estimated specimen age using skeletochronology and counted the number of lines of arrested growth (LAGs) on thin cross sections of femur bones. We observed from zero to five of LAGs for both male and female specimens. This indicated that the green anoles can survive at least five years in Chichi-jima Island. Body size increased with the number of LAGs, but the growth rate decreased when individuals had two LAGs. Our results suggest that the wild anoles might expend more energy for reproduction rather than for growth at this stage.
