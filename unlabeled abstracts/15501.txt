Current status of research progress on the biology and management of Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) as an invasive species
The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal) is a recent example of a serious biological invasive species, especially in the United States. It has also emerged as a global invasive pest, being detected in Canada, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, France, Greece, Hungary, and Italy. Halyomorpha halys is native to Asia and described as an occasional or outbreak pest of several crops as well as a nuisance pest in the native region. Due to serious economic losses caused by H. halys for US agriculture, unprecedented group efforts have been made to study the biology of H. halys and develop management strategies. This research effort has rapidly increased publications on H. halys, producing a large volume of new information on the biology and management of this invasive species. This article addresses the findings of recent research on H. halys in the invaded region, including North America and Europe. This review focuses on invasion dynamics, life history, damage, economic importance, monitoring tactics, and management strategies. This new information from the region that H. halys has invaded identifies research areas that need more attention and helps avoid duplicating research efforts in the native and invaded regions.
