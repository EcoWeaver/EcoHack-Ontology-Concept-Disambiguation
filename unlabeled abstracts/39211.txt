Novel fuzzy linguistic based mathematical model to assess risk of invasive alien plant species
The purpose of this study is to develop a mathematical model for risk assessment that evaluates the invasion risk of invasive alien plant species based on their biological attributes. Data for most of the attributes were qualitative and in the form of linguistic terms. In order to handle the numerical and linguistic variables, we proposed three models in the fuzzy environment. In the first model, all the selected attributes were considered as equally important to invasiveness and in the second and third models, these are considered to be unequally important. The important weights for the biological attributes in these models were gathered from the group of experts in plant sciences. Proposed Model III incorporates more sophisticated linguistic tool than Model II. Model II gives better predictions in comparison to the first and third models and it is found to be better tracking system for identifying potential invaders as in the case of conventional risk assessment method.
