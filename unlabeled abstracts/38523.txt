The invasion of the genus Marenzelleria (Polychaeta: Spionidae) into the Don River mouth and the Taganrog Bay: morphological and genetic study
Alien polychaetes belonging to the genus Marenzelleria were recorded from the mouth of the Don River and Taganrog Bay in the Sea of Azov in February-March 2014. Morphological characteristics varied greatly and matched those of two species: M. neglecta and M. arctia. Some individuals did not match the descriptions of both species. A genetic study using different sequences (primarily COI, but also 16S, 28S, cytb and nuclear histone 3a) showed that only M. neglecta was present despite some morphological mismatches. A morphological description of the species according to the new data is presented, together with a revised table of variability of the key numeric characters. Since 2014, Marenzelleria has spread swiftly and become dominant in a considerable part of the Taganrog Bay, making up to 91% of the total abundance/biomass (6800 ind. m-2 and 31.2 g m-2, respectively). Monodominant sites were also present. Its occurrence is 100% in recent surveys. Such a sharp increase seems to be due to a lack of detritophages in the bay; this is supported by the fact that M. neglecta has not formed its specific assemblage. The community structure, if M. neglecta is excluded, is equal to that before the invasion. In the Sea of Azov itself, M. neglecta is not as abundant, but occurs up to the Strait of Kertch and at some sites in the Black Sea. Its spread further into the Black Sea seems possible, as well as into the Caspian Sea via the Volga-Don Canal.
