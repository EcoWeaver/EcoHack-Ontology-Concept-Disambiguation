Malacostegine bryozoans (Bryozoa: Cheilostomata) from Bahia State, northeast Brazil: taxonomy and non-indigenous species
Bryozoans belonging to the suborder Malacostegina are commonly found in ports and bays around the world. They are often related to bioinvasion events and can be adapted to life on floating substrata, show tolerance to environmental stress and grow quickly when compared to other encrusting bryozoan species. Malacostegine bryozoans are simple morphologically, with few informative characters to distinguish taxa. Even so, the use of consistent morphological characters in addition to new ones may be helpful in providing confident taxonomic identifications needed for this common group in the fouling invasive community. Here, we provide taxonomic remarks on 13 species of Malacostegina from Bahia State, northeast Brazil. One new species, Conopeum loki n. sp., is described. At least six species reported here are originally from the Indo-Pacific region and are considered non-indigenous to the Atlantic Ocean: Biflustra grandicella, Biflustra irregulata, Biflustra okadai nom. nov., Arbocuspis bellula, Arbopercula bengalensis and Sinoflustra annae. Most of these taxa were collected at Todos os Santos Bay, a region with intense shipping traffic, tourism, activities of oil exploration and where other invertebrates, including bryozoans, have been already recognised as exotic. Although no immediate environmental or economic impact has been reported for the species here described, the detection of these exotic taxa constitute the first step in preventing bioinvasion events.
