Problems of Invasive Species of Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia Crassipes [Mart.] Solms) in Cameroon with Special Reference to Its Eradication and Valorization: A Bibliographical Review
Originally from South America, the water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes [Mart.] Solms) has been introduced in several parts of the world as an ornamental plant and particularly in Cameroon. However, this plant later became one of the most dangerous freshwater aquatic plant species. For this, it has been the subject of a global reflection because due to its rapid spread and its rapid development, it is at the origin of the difficulties encountered in the sector of river or maritime navigation, irrigation and life in an aquatic environment. In Cameroon, we observe a lot of damage to the environment and local economy caused by water hyacinth pollution of lakes and rivers. However, its infestation can be controlled by physical, chemical and biological methods of control which prove to be better adapted to a sustainable management of the hyacinth. Alongside these methods, there is an urgent need to reflect on its promotion, including its popularization, which will offer the populations of the areas concerned opportunities and impetus towards a change in pro-environmental behavior in the management of national heritage. This research work examines current research activities on the subject, based on the scientific and technological relevance of Eichhornia crassipes in the light of existing knowledge. In a specific way, this paper will focus on the systematic and the morphological description of the water hyacinth, the dispersion and the problems created by its presence, the means of control and valorization of the water hyacinth.
