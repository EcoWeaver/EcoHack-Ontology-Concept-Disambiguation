Global risks of Bedellia somnulentella (Lepidoptera: Bedelliidae) invasion: a modeling exercise using a mechanistic model, CLIMEX
This study aimed to identify the global risk of invasion and establishment of Bedellia somnulentella, a pest of the sweet potato crop, for the present and future time, to develop policies and prevent future outbreaks. Current climate projections and future (2030, 2050, 2070, and 2100) of the insect B. somnulentella were carried out using CLIMEX. The projections showed that climate change could reduce areas of high aptitude for B. somnulentella in the parallel range of latitude 0deg, the equator. On the other hand, temperate regions in the parallels with latitudes above 30degS and 30degN can increase hot and humid stress and become more suitable for the pest. This survey is based on weather data only. Data on land use and types, biotic interactions, diseases, natural enemies, alternative hosts, and competition were not considered for this model. Another uncertainty is associated with future levels of greenhouse gas emissions. The data presented here are helpful for the development of policies, studies, and strategies for the management of the B. somnulentella pest in the field. We encourage agricultural organizations in various countries to make strategic and long-term plans to avoid losses of millions of dollars through B. somnulentella.
