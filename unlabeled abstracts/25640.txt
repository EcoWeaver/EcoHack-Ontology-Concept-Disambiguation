First record of Barbonymus schwanenfeldii (Bleeker) in the Iberian Peninsula
The South-east Asian cyprinid Barbonymus schwanenfeldii is recorded for the first time in the Iberian Peninsula from two specimens collected in the Guadiana River Basin in 2005. Their presence is probably due to release from aquaria.
