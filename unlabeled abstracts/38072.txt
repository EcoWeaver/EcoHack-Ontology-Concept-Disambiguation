The use of suction traps for detection of unwanted invasive insects and other invertebrates
This paper reviews the potential for using suction traps, especially existing networks, to detect unwanted exotic insects and invertebrates invading new locations. Suction traps are thought to sample small, fragile, slow and weak flying insects better than other methods. Suction traps over 6 m high have been shown to catch invertebrates from at least 13 different insect orders and 87 different insect families as well as Acari (mites) and Araneae (spiders). Suction traps have provided the first location records for a number of aphid species and new records of invasive species. Several issues require attention if suction traps are to become established tools for detection of unwanted invasive organisms. These include minimising the cost of traps, developing rapid identification methods, establishing the optimum location of the traps and investigating the ability of suction traps to catch species in time for remedial action.
