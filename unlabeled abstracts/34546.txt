Comparative transcriptome analysis of three invasive leafminer flies provides insights into interspecific competition
Liriomyza spp. (Diptera: Agromyzidae) represent a group of economically-significant highly polyphagous pests of plants grown in field and greenhouse conditions. Liriomyza spp. share similar biological and morphological characteristics , and complex interspecific interactions have been documented among these species in various geographical regions. Where the displacement of one of these species by the other has been studied, no unique mechanisms have been identified as causing it. The impact of competitive factors (such as, insecticide tolerance, thermotolerance, and adaptability to cropping systems) may be unique to specific geographic regions of Liriomyza spp., but more research is needed to confirm these hypotheses. In this study, RNA-seq was used to determine the transcriptomes of three closely-related leafminers, e.g. L. sativae, L. trifolii, and L. huidobrensis. Over 20 Gb of clean reads were generated and assembled into unique transcriptomes, and 38,747 unigenes were annotated in different databases. In pairwise comparisons, L. trifolii and L. sativae had more up-regulated genes than L. huidobrensis. With respect to common differentially-expressed genes (Co-DEGs), the three leafminers exhibited distinct groups of highly-expressed gene clusters. When genes related to competitive factors were compared , expression patterns in L. trifolii and L. sativae were more closely related to each other than to L. huidobrensis. The data suggest that DEGs involved in competitive factors may play a key role in competition and displacement of leafminers. The divergent genes identified in this study will be valuable in revealing possible mechanisms of invasion, displacement and interspecific competition in Liriomyza spp.
