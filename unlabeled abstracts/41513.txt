The significance of lenticels for successful Pityogenes chalcographus (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) invasion of Norway spruce trees [ Picea abies (Pinaceae)]
In this study we tested whether Pityogenes chalcographus L. beetles preferably infest their host tree, Picea abies (L.) Karst., through lenticels or not. In a second step the resin canal system, which is important for defence against bark beetles, was investigated under lenticels and under lenticel-free periderm. Beetle colonisation tests on breeding logs resulted in 93.2% successful invasions through lenticels, 4.2% through lenticel-free periderm, 1.2% through wounds, and 1.4% near branches (n=1,606). Three main reasons why beetles invade preferable sites are discussed, taking the function of lenticels to supply gas exchange of the interior tissues into consideration. First, attractive volatiles are more easily detectable over the lenticels, and this could be a stimulus for the bark beetles to invade their hosts through these structures. Secondly, the very loosely arranged tissues of the lenticel and bigger intercellular spaces in the cortex and secondary phloem under the lenticel permit the beetles easier movement towards the vascular cambium. Thirdly, the total resin canal area of both primary and secondary canals and the number of secondary resin canals were reduced under lenticels. A higher resin canal density beneath lenticels would constitute a barrier to gas movement.
