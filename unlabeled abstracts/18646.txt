Qualitative impacts of Senna spectabilis on distribution of welfare: A household survey of dependent communities in Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda
This paper presents the results of a household survey designed to qualitatively evaluate the impacts of the invasive alien species Senna spectabilis on the distribution of welfare across dependent communities in Budongo forest reserve (BFR) in Uganda. BFR is the largest forest reserve in Uganda with globally significant conservation values. The study establishes that households in BFR have high levels of knowledge on its conservation values, they are aware of the invasiveness of S. spectabilis and its potential to compromise the conservation values of BFR, and that S. spectabilis confers tangible benefits to dependent households, whose levels significantly vary with proximity to the reserve. The study concludes by evaluating strategies designed to manage the spread of S. spectabilis in BFR which consider its demonstrated socioeconomic impacts.
