A new tool for power analysis of fixed plot data: Using simulations and mixed effects models to evaluate forest metrics
Since 2006, the National Park Service's Northeast Temperate Network (NETN) has been monitoring forest health in 10 national park units in the northeastern U.S. using a protocol adapted from the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program. To ensure current methods are appropriate for monitoring long-term trends in forest composition, structure and function, we performed a power analysis of key forest metrics using data collected in each park and covering two four-year survey cycles. We determined statistical power by repeatedly generating bootstrapped datasets with specified percent change between survey cycles in the value of each metric, and then testing whether a mixed effects model detected a significant change. We applied effect sizes ranging from a 50% decline to a 50% increase in 5% increments. Power analyses indicated that, for most key forest metrics, our monitoring program met the target of detecting a 40% change in a metric over a 12-year period with 80% power and a Type I erro
