Distribution of the invasive freshwater shrimp Palaemon sinensis (Sollaud, 1911) in rivers of Hiroshima Prefecture, western Japan
The freshwater palaemonid shrimp, Palaemon sinensis was imported into Japan from China as live fishing bait, and its introduction has become a concern in Japanese freshwater areas. In the present study, field research was conducted to confirm the distribution of this invasive shrimp in eight rivers in Hiroshima Prefecture, western Japan. We found caridean shrimp, such as P. sinensis, Palaemon paucidens, Palaemon serrifer, Palaemon macrodactylus, Palaemon orientis, Macrobrachium nipponense, Caridina leucosticta, and Neocaridina spp.. P. sinensis was found in four rivers. A longitudinal distribution analysis showed that P. sinensis occurred in the lower reaches, whereas P. paucidens showed a wider distribution from the upper to the lower reaches. Palaemon sinensis occurred in a narrow range of stream velocity (0-2 cm/s) compared with that of P. paucidens (0-18 cm/s). P. sinensis density was negatively correlated with river velocity, indicating that this shrimp prefers a lentic water environment.
