Effects of invasive wetland macrophytes on habitat selection and movement by freshwater turtles
AbstractInvasive species can significantly impact native wildlife by structurally altering habitats and access to resources. Understanding how native species respond to habitat modification by invasive species can inform effective habitat restoration, avoiding inadvertent harm to species at risk. The invasive graminoids Phragmites australis australis (hereafter Phragmites) and Typha x glauca are increasingly dominating Nearctic wetlands, often outcompeting native vegetation. Previous research suggests that turtles may avoid invasive Phragmites when moving through their home ranges, but the mechanisms driving avoidance are unclear. We tested two hypotheses that could explain avoidance of invaded habitat: (1) that stands of invasive macrophytes (Phragmites and Typha x glauca) impede movement, and (2) that they provide inadequate thermal conditions for turtles. We quantified active-season movements of E. blandingii (n = 14, 1328 relocations) and spotted turtles (Clemmys guttata; n = 12, 2295 relocations) in a coastal wetland in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Neither hypothesis was supported by the data. Phragmites and mixed-species Typha stands occurred within the home ranges of mature, active E. blandingii and C. guttata, and were used similarly to most other available habitats, regardless of macrophyte stem density. Turtles using stands of invasive macrophytes did not experience restricted movements or cooler shell temperatures compared to other wetland habitat types. Control of invasive macrophytes can restore habitat heterogeneity and benefit native wetland species. However, such restoration work should be informed by the presence of at-risk turtles, as heavy machinery used for control or removal may injure turtles that use these stands as habitat.
