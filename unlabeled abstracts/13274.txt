Naturalization of Fragaria x ananassa Duch. in Western Siberia
The process of the Fragaria x ananassa naturalization in Western Siberia lasts approximately 80 years from the moment of the appearance of first garden strawberry cultivars at agricultural experimental stations in 1933. The species invasive status changed slightly for such a long period of time (from casual alien plants to naturalized plants), and it corresponds to colonophytes in regards to degree of naturalization. The ornitochory is one reason the F. x ananassa appears in natural phytocenoses. At present, the F. x ananassa naturalization occurs in two directions, including genetic transformations in long-living coenopopulations and the reinvasion of new ecotypes of the same species in natural phytocenoses. The high death of seedlings in naturalized F. x ananassa does not allow the species to actively occupy regeneration niches in natural phytocenoses, which precludes the invasive plant status for the F. x ananassa at this stage of the F. x ananassa naturalization in Western Siberia.
