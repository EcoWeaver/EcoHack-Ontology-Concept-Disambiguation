Long-term correlations in European socioeconomic conditions create a bias to conclusion that an invasion debt occurs.
Essl et al. (1) tested whether historical socioeconomic conditions have created an invasion debt in Europe (i.e., a suite of nonnative species that have not yet been discovered but whose establishment has been determined by previous socioeconomic conditions). Essl et al. (1) tested this theory by asking whether the cumulative numbers of nonnative species presently established in 28 European countries were more closely correlated to socioeconomic conditions in the year 1900 or 2000. In this letter, we describe a flaw in their logic that biases the analysis to concluding that an invasion debt does occur.
