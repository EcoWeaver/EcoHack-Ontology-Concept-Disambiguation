Drastic reduction of the functional diversity of native ichthyofauna in a Neotropical lake following invasion by piscivorous fishes
Abstract Biological invasions are leading several species to extinction and are projected as a main driver of biodiversity changes in lakes for this century. However, the knowledge of their impacts on the Neotropical ichthyofauna over time remains largely incipient, especially when considering the functional diversity of native communities. Here we aim to identify the effects of non-native species, especially the non-native piscivorous Cichla kelberi and Pygocentrus nattereri, on the functional diversity of the native ichthyofauna of the Carioca Lake, Middle Rio Doce basin, state of Minas Gerais. Using fish occurrence data for eight years from 1983 to 2010 combined with an ecomorphological-trait analysis, we found that while the native species richness dropped to 56%, the functional richness is only 27% of that found before introductions. In other words, more than species, the ichthyofauna suffered an impressive decline in the range of functional traits, which can further have severe impacts on ecological processes within that system. When considering all the components of the current ichthyofauna (native and non-native species), neither taxonomic nor functional richness have changed over time. However, even keeping biodiversity levels, non-native species are not able to fully compensate for the extinct native ones in terms of functions.
