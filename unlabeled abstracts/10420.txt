The precautionary principle and biological invasion: the case of the House Sparrow on the Lesser Antilles
The capacity to react quickly to species introductions and to plan effective management countermeasures is always difficult, and methodology is lacking. This paper summarizes the different steps of a decision-making protocol applied to the recent establishment of an exotic species, the House Sparrow Passer domesticus, in the Lesser Antilles. This pest bird damages crops, fruits and stored food products and also competes with numerous hole-nesting birds in a large part of its range, and this requires more or less rapid management decision to limit its impact. In order to construct a base for decision-making in the Lesser Antilles case, we designed and conducted a brief biological study involving three spatial scales. At the regional scale, we defined the state of spread of House Sparrows throughout the West Indies. At the island scale, we estimated the number and distribution of breeding colonies. At the local scale, we estimated the numbers and behaviour of House Sparrows. To enable a quick decision to be made, we also suggested organizing a collective decision-making process applying a multi-actor guideline taking account of the different kinds of actors and levels of competence. We applied this method and we presented our results to a multi-actor workshop. The collective decision-making chose to apply the precautionary principle on one island (bird eradication) and to install both communications and monitoring plans. The procedure involving both multi-spatial scale assessment and a multi-actor workshop needs to be refined but its prospects are promising.
