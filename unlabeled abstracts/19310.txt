Fragment Size and Planting Depth Affect the Regenerative Capacity of Bushkiller (Cayratia japonica)
AbstractBushkiller (Cayratia japonica) is a herbaceous, perennial vine that reproduces from seed and vegetative root structures within its native range. However, this species is considered invasive in the United States due to prolific shoot production, which can overtop surrounding vegetation. Cultural control practices, such as mulching, have been observed to further the spread of this species through regeneration of root fragments. Research was conducted to determine the regenerative capacity of bushkiller root fragments (1 to 7 cm; 2.5 to 18 inches) buried at various depths (0 to 40 cm). Root length and planting depth affected leaf number, shoot number, plant height, and shoot biomass. Bushkiller leaf density, shoot density, plant height, and dry weight increased as root fragment length increased from 1 to 7 cm; conversely, these variables decreased as planting depth increased from 0 to 40 cm. Results indicate bushkiller regeneration capacity from root fragments is extremely high and control practices that fragment roots should be avoided to reduce further spread.
