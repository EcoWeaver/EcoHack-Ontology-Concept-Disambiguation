The new European invader Aedes (Finlaya) koreicus: a potential vector of chikungunya virus
Arthropod-borne disease outbreaks, facilitated by the introduction of exotic mosquitoes, pose a significant public health threat. Recent chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemics in Europe highlight the importance of understanding the vector potential of invading mosquitoes. In this paper we explore the potential of Aedes koreicus, a mosquito new to Europe, to transmit CHIKV. Mosquitoes were challenged with CHIKV and maintained at two temperatures: 23 degC and a fluctuating temperature. Total CHIKV infection rates at 3, 10 and 14 days post-feeding were low for both temperature treatments (13.8% at 23 degC; 6.2% at fluctuating T). A low percentage (6.1%, n = 65) of mosquitoes maintained at a constant 23 degC showed dissemination of the virus to the wings and legs. Infection of mosquito saliva, with live virus, occurred in 2 mosquitoes. No dissemination was noted under the fluctuating temperature regime. Based on these results we conclude that CHIKV transmission by this species is possible.
