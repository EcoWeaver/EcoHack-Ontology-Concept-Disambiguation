Reply to Keller and Springborn: No doubt about invasion debt
We recently showed (1) that, for a wide range of taxa, the current numbers of established alien species in 28 European countries were generally more closely related to socioeconomic indicators from the year 1900 than 2000. Thus, the establishment of alien species seemed to lag considerably behind one of the main drivers of alien species introductions (2). We concluded that current high socioeconomic activity could result in considerable additional accumulation of alien species in the future, a phenomenon that we have called invasion debt. Keller and Springborn (3) suggest that cumulative numbers of established alien species would be better explained by variables that are a function of the cumulative human activity rather than by socioeconomic data from any given year. Moreover, they argue that socioeconomic conditions show temporal auto-correlation, and as a result, the power of the 2000 data to explain variation in socioeconomic activities over a longer time frame is truncated, because we do not know how economic indicators will develop in the future. We have previously applied cumulative socioeconomic variables to show the relative importance of socioeconomic factors over geographic and climate variables in current patterns of alien species richness in Europe (2). Unfortunately, cumulative measures are not available for 1900, but in any case, variation across countries in measures such as wealth is highly correlated with gross domestic product (GDP) for individual years. The pitfalls of temporal autocorrelation are addressed in our paper (figure S1 in ref.
