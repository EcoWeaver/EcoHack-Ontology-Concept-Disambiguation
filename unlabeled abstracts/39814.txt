Three Native Species as Possible Control for Limnoperna Fortunei in Net Cage Farming in the Itaipu Reservoir
The golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) possesses high fouling potential and has caused damage to various productive sectors. These individuals do not present known natural enemies, but they may be part of the feeding of one or more species of fish, which would help in their control. The main species of fish cultivated in cages in the Itaipu reservoir is pacu (mesopotamicus), and other species have also been evaluated in relation to intensive production viability such as jundia (Rhamdia quelen) and curimbata (Prochilodus lineatus). One of the problems faced in the net cages system in the Itaipu reservoir is the inlaying of the golden mussel in the cage's mesh, making it difficult to handle, requiring more maintenance and reducing the service life of the net cages. This paper aims at evaluate the presence of L. fortunei in the digestive tract of three native species of fish cultivated in cages in the Itaipu reservoir. L. fortunei were present in the gastrointestinal tract of pacus and jundias, and there was no L. fortunei in curimbatas. It is possible to conclude that for the three species studied, only jundia and pacu have the capacity to consume and to control the L. fortunei embedded in the mesh of the net cages.
