Field mustard (Brassica rapa) an invasive weed species in cauliflower fields is a host of multiple phytoplasmas
Field mustard plants present in cauliflower fields were observed exhibiting branch proliferation, small and deformed leaves and flowers. The virtual RFLP and online tool iPhyclassifier identified phytoplasmas of the 16SrIII-B, 16SrIII-J, 16SrIII-U and 16SrVII-B subgroups. Representatives of these subgroups were previously identified in cauliflower. This study evidenced field mustard as a host that can serve as inoculum source for commercial crops.
