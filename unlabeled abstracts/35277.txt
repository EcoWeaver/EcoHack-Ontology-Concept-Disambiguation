Exotic species, Micropterus salmoides, as a key bioindicator influencing the reservoir health and fish community structure
This study was carried out to analyze the difference of fish fauna, ecological indicator characteristics, biological status of other fish population and fish community structures between two groups of reservoir ecosystems along with the invasion of introduced Micropterus salmoides. Six reservoirs were selected and divided into two groups; reservoirs non-invaded and invaded by M. salmoides were RNIv and RIv respectively. Total 28 species 11,519 individuals were sampled in RNIv whereas 19 species 1,925 individuals were sampled in RIv. Korean endemic fish population dominates in RNIv, exotic fish species, especially M. salmoides population dominate in RIv. Sensitive species dominates in RNIv, while tolerant species and carnivore species dominate in RIv. The analysis of total length size distribution showed some difference, particularly in special size group between RNIv and RIv. Also, the analysis of total fish biomass showed a significant difference in accordance with M. salmoides inhabitation. According to the fish community analysis results, as M. salmoides proportion increased, species richness and diversity were decreased. Overall data suggests that the dominant distribution of M. salmoides may influence simplification of the fish fauna, species composition as well as community structure and affect the length distribution and biomass of other fish population negatively.
