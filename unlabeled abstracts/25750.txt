Managing outbreaks of invasive species: Eradication versus suppression
A framework is developed to evaluate eradication as one of three alternative management responses to an outbreak of an invasive species: eradication, suppression or no action. This framework can be used to establish under what conditions an eradication option could provide an expected net economic benefit, and whether this net benefit exceeds that of the other two options. The eradication option is more likely to be preferred in situations where there is an immediate export benefit that is derived from eradication of the outbreak, and also the uncertainty associated with the likely success of eradication is low.
