Molecular diversity and antimicrobial susceptibility of Listeria monocytogenes isolates from invasive infections in Poland (1997-2013)
AbstractThe epidemiology of invasive listeriosis in humans appears to be weakly characterized in Poland, the sixth most populous member state of the European Union. We obtained antimicrobial susceptibility data, PCR-serogroups and genotypic profiles for 344 invasive isolates of Listeria monocytogenes, collected between 1997 and 2013 in Poland. All isolates were susceptible to the 10 tested antimicrobials, except one that was resistant to tetracycline and minocycline and harbored the tet(M), tet(A) and tet(C) genes. Overall, no increasing MIC values were observed during the study period. Four PCR-serogroups were observed: IVb (55.8%), IIa (34.3%), IIb (8.1%) and IIc (1.8%). We identified clonal complexes (CCs) and epidemic clones (ECs) previously involved in outbreaks worldwide, with the most prevalent CCs/ECs being: CC6/ECII (32.6%), CC1/ECI (17.2%), CC8/ECV (6.1%) and CC2/ECIV (5.5%). The present study is the first extensive analysis of Polish L. monocytogenes isolates from invasive infections.
