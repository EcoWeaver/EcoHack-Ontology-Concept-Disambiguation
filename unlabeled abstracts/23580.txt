The occurrence of Glyceria striata (Lam.) Hitchc. in Europe and the new localities of the species in Poland
Glyceria striata (Lam.) Hitchc. is a North American species that has been recorded in most, semi-natural habitats in Europe, e. g. in meadows, bog springs, margins of water bodies. It is circumscribed within two taxa of lower rank: G. striata subsp. striata and G. striata subsp. stricta. Only G. striata subsp. stricta has been reported from Europe. This paper gives a list of the European localities of the species (48) and describes two newly discovered localities in Poland (the Wyzyna Malopolska upland and the Western Carpathian Mts.). The distribution of G. striata in Europe is mapped and potential migration routes of the species are discussed.
