Biological control of invasive zebra mussel (Dreissen polymorpha) in a freshwater ecosystem through Potamon ibericum
In the present study, possible effects of using Potamon ibericum for the prevention of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion in a freshwater ecosystem were investigated. In a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) supplied with aerated freshwater, 3 individuals of P. ibericum were placed in each of 3 aquariums provided by 100 zebra mussels. Throughout the 90-day monitoring study, mussel consumption was visually counted and then new mussels were introduced daily to complete the number of mussels to hundred, repeatedly each day. Throughout the monitoring study, growth rates, number of mussels consumed, and the number of broken mussel shell pieces were determined. Daily consumption rate of mussels by each crab was recorded as 11.115, 11.104, and 11.107 mussel/crab in the 3 experimental groups, respectively. The consumption rate of mussels per crab was counted as 999.78 over the 90-days experiment. As a result, the findings of this study provide strong evidence that P. ibericum can be used for
