The relationship between distance and genetic similarity among invasive rat populations in the Falkland Islands
Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) have been either introduced to or have invaded a large number of the world's islands. Rats have caused population declines and the extinction of island endemics. Their eradication is often a major conservation success as it leads to recovery of affected species and even ecosystem processes. However, eradication efforts can be hampered by the ability of rats to re-colonize eradicated islands. Here we present the results of genetic analyses that inform migration rates and population structure of Norway rats from 14 sampling locations in the Falkland Islands, where rat eradication efforts are taking place. We used 12 microsatellite markers and population genetic tools to estimate rat migration patterns between 12 islands that were separated by distances rang- ing from 230 m to 112 km. We found evidence of significant migration rates, and hence presumably of rat movements between islands up to 830 m away from each other. Norway rats seem capable of swimming this distance even in the cold waters of the Falkland Islands. Our results can inform managers about strategies of rat eradication in the Falklands including minimal distances that reduce recolonization and the choice of island clusters for eradication.
