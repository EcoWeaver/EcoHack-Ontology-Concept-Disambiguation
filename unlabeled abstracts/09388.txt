Using differential responses to light spectra as a monitoring and control tool for Arhopalus ferus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) and other exotic wood-boring pests.
Several longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) and bark beetles (Scolytinae) have been accidentally introduced to New Zealand and are now widespread and abundant. In particular Arhopalus ferus (Mulsant) represents a significant quarantine risk for export timber. Because of this risk timber is fumigated with methyl bromide. Six different light traps baited with different colors (yellow, red, green, white, UV-black light [UV-BL], and UV-black-light-blue [UV-BLB]) were investigated for their population monitoring potential and as a push-pull (incorporating mass trapping) alternative control technique. UV-BLB light traps captured an order of magnitude more A. ferus (122 individuals per night) than yellow light traps (eight individuals per night). The bark beetles Hylurgus ligniperda (F.) and Hylastes ater (Paykull) were most attracted to UV-BL lights that captured 2-4 times more beetles than traps baited with other wavelengths. Results suggest that light traps provide a sensitive method for population monitoring. The responses of these wood borers and bark beetles to different colored light traps provide an opportunity to apply a push-pull control technique. The management of these species could be improved by minimizing the visual attractiveness (push) of wood processing facilities through a conversion to low intensity yellow site lighting, combined with the strategic placement of UV light traps for mass-trapping of residual populations (pull). Light management on its own is unlikely to eliminate the quarantine risk entirely; however, it is likely to reduce populations substantially and contribute toward the aim of reducing methyl bromide use.
