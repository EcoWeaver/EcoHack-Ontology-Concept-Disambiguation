Photosynthetic Responses of Heliophilous Rhus Species to Environmental Modification by Invasive Shrubs
1. This study aimed to determine the effect of overtopping and shading by the alien invasive plant species Acacia cyclops on the gas exchange characteristics and photosynthetic capacity of Rhus glauca and R. lucida, both indigenous heliophilous shrub species in the western Cape Province of South Africa. 2. Overtopped individuals of both indigenous species showed morphological and physiological changes generally consistent with widely reported shade effects. However, R. lucida showed an apparently rare combination of unchanged maximum photosynthetic rate (A<sub>max</sub>) and increased apparent quantum yield (a) under shaded conditions. 3. The major constraint to photosynthesis in the otherwise well-adapted alienshaded individuals of R. lucida appeared to be stomatal lags in response to rapid changes in light, and an inappropriate diurnal stomatal rhythm. This limitation in R. lucida, together with the lower respiratory costs incurred by shaded R. glauca, suggest that R. glauca was the better adapted of the two species to deep shade conditions beneath the alien canopy. This advantage may be accentuated by an apparent lack of competition for soil water resources between R. glauca and the alien. 4. The suite of morphological and physiological adaptations shown by R. lucida may equip this species better for survival in a more exposed position at the edge of an overtopping canopy.
