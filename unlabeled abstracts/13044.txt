Primeiro relato de Lernaea cyprinacea (Copepoda: Lernaeidae) em girinos e ras recem-metamorfoseadas em populacoes selvagens de Lithobates catesbeianus (Anura: Ranidae) na Argentina
Lernaea cyprinacea is an ectoparasitic copepod that can result in the mortality of the host by causing hemorrhages, ulcerations, and secondary infections. Lernaea cyprinacea is widely distributed in Argentina. Previous reports are restricted almost exclusively to cases of parasitism in fishes; copepod parasitism of anuran larvae is rarely documented. This is the first record and description of the parasitic infestation of L. cyprinacaea on tadpoles of the exotic and invasive species Lithobates catesbeianus in Argentina. A total of 15 tadpoles and 21 newly-metamorphosed individuals of L. catesbeianus were collected from the mountain town of Rio de los Sauces, and 12 tadpoles from the Toledo Stream. A maximum of two parasites per host was found, principally in the cloaca. Clinical symptoms of inflammation hemorrhage and ulcers in the skin with mucus formation in the attachment area of parasites were observed.
