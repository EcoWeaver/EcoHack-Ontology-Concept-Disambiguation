THE SPREAD OF AN ALIEN BIVALVE (MUSCULISTA SENHOUSIA) IN THE SACCA DI GORO LAGOON (ADRIATIC SEA, ITALY)
The Asian date mussel, Musculista senhousia (Mytilidae), which is endemic in the western Pacific, appeared and became abundant in the Sacca di Goro, a brackish lagoon in the Po River Delta (northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) in the early 1990s. The course of the invasion was documented through a macrobenthic monitoring programme at three sites in the Sacca. From 1994, when the new mussel was first collected, M. senhousia spread throughout the lagoon and, within a few years, reached densities exceeding 10,000 individuals m -2 . Mussel effects on biodiversity were assessed by comparing macrobenthic community structure and composition: over a 5-year period some changes in the macrobenthic community seem to be apparent, suggesting a positive effect of the mussel on the number of species and benthic richness. Considering trophic guilds, significant positive correlations were found between M. senhousia and detritivores and herbivores, while suspension feeders probably suffered competition from the mussel. Musculista senhousia was initially successful because it exploited a naturally disturbed, sparsely occupied environment. The well-dated documentation of the first collections, increasing abundance and spread of M. senhousia at our study sites provided an opportunity to observe a biological invasion of a habitat in progress.
