Isolation and characterization of microsatellite loci in the invasive Alliaria petiolata (Brassicaceae)
Eight novel polymorphic microsatellite loci are presented for garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata, Brassicaceae) a European herb that is a serious invader of North American deciduous forests. The microsatellites will be useful tools to analyse pathways of introduction of garlic mustard, as well as its evolutionary potential in the invasive range.
