Adaptation to cold and predation--shelter use by invasive raccoon dogs Nyctereutes procyonoides in Bialowieza Primeval Forest (Poland)
Based on radio-tracking of raccoon dogs Nyctereutes procyonoides in Bialowieza Primeval Forest (E Poland) in 1997-2002, we addressed the hypothesis that pattern of shelter use by this invasive carnivore is an adaptation to both climatic conditions and predation. Raccoon dogs used various types of shelters but were invariably concealed in dense vegetation or in the shelters created by trunks, branches, or roots of fallen trees (58% of days). Burrows (mainly badger setts) and hollow trees (mainly fallen limes) were selected on 27% and 14% of days, respectively. The pattern of shelter use varied throughout the year. In crucial periods (breeding period and winter), raccoon dogs used shelter offering better protection: burrows and hollow trees (use of which increased with decreasing ambient temperature) in winter, and hollow trees and dense vegetation during breeding and raising pups. The pattern of shelter use by raccoon dogs was also strongly modified by forest structure. Raccoon dogs living in the pristine old-growth stands (with large amounts of dead wood) utilized mainly natural shelters created by fallen trees (trunks, branches, and roots) and sedge tussocks (38% and 37%, respectively). Individuals inhabiting the managed part of the Forest used mainly burrows (43%) and thicket (23%). We recorded very strong monogamous relationships between pair mates, manifested by shared resting on 84% of days per year. We conclude that hiding behavior and plasticity in shelter use is a response to high mortality due to predation and to unfavorable climatic conditions. High adaptability to various environmental conditions may be one of the factors underlying successful range expansion of raccoon dogs in Europe.
