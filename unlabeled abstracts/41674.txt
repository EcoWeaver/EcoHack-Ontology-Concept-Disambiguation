Monitoring invasive quagga mussels, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (Bivalvia: Dreissenidae), and other benthic organisms in a western US aqueduct
A quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis Andrusov, 1897) invasion of an aqueduct in Arizona was monitored from 2007 - 2011 using colonization substrates. As numbers increased, a filtering-collector caddisfly (Smicridea fasciatella McLachlan, 1871) declined significantly in abundance. After two years of colonization, freshwater sponges were detected and associated with a decline in D. r. bugensis numbers. Periphyton biomass increased considerably on substrates; perhaps partially, the result of decreased turbidity. Aqueduct biofoulers could have major impacts on costs associated with aqueduct maintenance. From an operations viewpoint, mussels are undesirable due to flow restriction associated with increased friction. Augmented sponge and periphyton biomass may also influence aqueduct operations and efficiencies.
