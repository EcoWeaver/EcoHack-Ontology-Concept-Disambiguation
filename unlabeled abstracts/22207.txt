A hierarchical framework for integrating invasibility experiments incorporating different factors and spatial scales
Results from experiments studying different factors determining invasibility (e.g. land use, disturbance, biotic interactions) at different spatial scales are mainly used in isolation, probably because a methodology for integration is lacking. Recent studies show that factors affecting invasibility most likely do so in a hierarchical manner, with different factors acting more strongly at different spatial scales. Climate can be considered the dominant factor at the continental scale, while at regional and landscape scale topography, land cover and land use become increasingly important. At smaller spatial scales, soil type, disturbance, biotic interactions, resources, and microclimate may become significant. In the current paper, we propose a hierarchical framework for combining results from different types of studies. In this hierarchical system, factors operating at a smaller scale are subordinate to factors operating at a larger scale, but if conditions at higher levels are satisfied, the small-scale factors may become indispensable for making accurate predictions. Depending on the aim of the study, the accuracy of prediction can be selected by the researcher, which in its turn determines which data are required. We discuss several applications of the framework and indicate some options for future research. Although the complexity of natural systems presents fundamental limits to predictions, we think this framework can provide a useful tool for the identification of areas of risk for biological invasions, for improving our understanding of invasibility, and for identifying gaps in our current knowledge.
