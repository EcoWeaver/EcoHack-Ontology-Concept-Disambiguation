Is there metabolic cold adaptation in terrestrial ectotherms? Exploring a latitudinal compensation using a common garden experiment of the invasive snailCornu aspersum
AbstractLower temperatures, extreme seasonality and shorter growing seasons at higher latitudes are expected to cause a decline in metabolic rates and annual growth rates of ectotherms. If a reduction in the rates of these biological processes involves a reduction in fitness, then organisms may evolve compensatory responses for the constraints imposed by high-latitude habitats. To test the existence of a latitudinal compensation in ectotherms we used a common garden experiment to investigate the extent to which the level of energy turnover (measured as standard metabolic rate, SMR) and the energy budget (energy allocation to growth) are affected by climatic constraints in three populations of the land snail Cornu aspersum, distributed across a latitudinal gradient of 1300 kms in Chile. Our results did not support the existence of a latitudinal compensation in metabolic rates (Metabolic Cold adaptation). However, there was a countergradient variation (CnGV) for growth rate in which the highest latitudinal population exhibited greater growth rates than their counterparts from lower latitudes. Surprisingly, this CnGV pattern was accompanied by a lower apparent dry-matter digestibility, which could highlight a differential assimilation of ingested nutrients into somatic tissue, revealing enhanced growth efficiency in snails from the highest latitudinal habitat. Our evidence highlights that adjustments in energy allocation to the digestive machinery and to protein storage could act as a latitudinal compensation for enhanced growth efficiency in snails from the highest latitudinal population.
