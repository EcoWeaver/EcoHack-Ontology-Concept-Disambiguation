Life history variation of an invasive species Botrylloides violaceus (Oka, 1927) between novel coastal habitats in the Gulf of Maine
Species invasions are characterized by range expansions during which invasive species respond ecologically and evolutionarily to new environmental conditions. Responses to novel environments often involve shifts in life history traits, which may be due to phenotypic plasticity, local adaptation, or both. Identifying how species vary across novel habitats can help determine how invaders integrate themselves into local ecosystems, which is a poorly understood aspect of marine ecology and management. In the Gulf of Maine, the invasive ascidian Botrylloides violaceus (Oka, 1927) is found on man-made substrates and has also entered natural subtidal habitats. To investigate if the life history characteristics of B. violaceus vary across habitats, colonies were grown on polycarbonate plates in floating dock, eelgrass bed, and rocky subtidal habitats, and life history traits were quantified from settlement until death from June 2012 to July 2013. This was replicated at three sites along the Massachusetts coast. Settlement density differed among habitats and was highest in floating dock, lower in eelgrass bed, and least in rocky subtidal habitats. Terminal age was not different among habitats. Terminal size and maximum growth rates were higher in floating dock and eelgrass bed habitats than in the rocky subtidal habitats. The duration of colony regression did not differ among habitats. In floating dock habitats, distinct, seasonal cohorts were observed. These results suggest that B. violaceus is most successful in manmade versus natural habitats. Its integration into natural habitats may, however, be in an early phase; with B. violaceus still posing a threat to native species and ecosystems.
