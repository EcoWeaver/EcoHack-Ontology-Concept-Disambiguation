Invasive aphids attack native Hawaiian plants
Invasive species have had devastating impacts on the fauna and flora of the Hawaiian Islands. While the negative effects of some invasive species are obvious, other species are less visible, though no less important. Aphids (Homoptera: Aphididae) are not native to Hawai'i but have thoroughly invaded the Island chain, largely as a result of anthropogenic influences. As aphids cause both direct plant feeding damage and transmit numerous pathogenic viruses, it is important to document aphid distributions and ranges throughout the archipelago. On the basis of an extensive survey of aphid diversity on the five largest Hawaiian Islands (Hawai'i, Kaua'i, O'ahu, Maui, and Moloka'i), we provide the first evidence that invasive aphids feed not just on agricultural crops, but also on native Hawaiian plants. To date, aphids have been observed feeding and reproducing on 64 native Hawaiian plants (16 indigenous species and 48 endemic species) in 32 families. As the majority of these plants are endangered, invasive aphids may have profound impacts on the island flora. To help protect unique island ecosystems, we propose that border vigilance be enhanced to prevent the incursion of new aphids, and that biological control efforts be renewed to mitigate the impact of existing species.
