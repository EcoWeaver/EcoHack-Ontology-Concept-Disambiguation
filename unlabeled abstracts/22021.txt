An alternative hypothesis to invasional meltdown in the Laurentian Great Lakes region: General facilitation by Dreissena
Invasional meltdown, where established non-indigenous species facilitate the establishment and spread of newly arriving non-indigenous species, may contribute to the increasing rate of biological invasions. The Laurentian Great Lakes have been used as an example of invasional meltdown, but our results suggest that this may not be the case. We propose that the increased numbers of facilitative interactions are not due to an invasion meltdown, but rather a strongly interacting species, such as Dreissena, promoting population level changes in both native and non-indigenous species. Dreissena are the facilitator in the majority of reported facilitations of non-indigenous species, and those non-indigenous species have not yet led to more invasions. Further, our results show that Dreissena facilitate non-indigenous and native species similarly. Literature reviews showed little evidence that Dreissena facilitate fish or are facilitated by phytoplankton. Consequently, the observed pattern of species interactions in the Great Lakes does not conform to the definition of invasional meltdown. We suggest that Dreissena cause strong interactions and change the benthos in a way that facilitates many organisms (native and non-indigenous), but that system-wide invasional meltdown is not occurring in the Great Lakes.
