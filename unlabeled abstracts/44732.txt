Low habitat specificity in one of Europe's most invasive spiders - Mermessus trilobatus
Most spiders are mobile and easily transported across the world via human activity, making them ideal candidates for biological invasions. Mermessus trilobatus (Emerton, 1882) is one of Europe's most invasive spider species and one of the few invasive spider species that successfully invade (semi-) natural ecosystems. Yet, its invasion success is not well understood. We investigated the Niche Breadth-Invasion Success Hypothesis in an old sand quarry with high habitat diversity in northern Belgium. We captured spiders using pitfall traps at 25 locations over 14 months. The activity-density of M. trilobatus could be linked to soil pH and temperature. Mermessus trilobatus showed the highest habitat diversity of all 150 species captured and was one of the few species found in each pitfall trap. The low habitat specificity of M. trilobatus could be key in population establishment, fast spread and invasion success.
