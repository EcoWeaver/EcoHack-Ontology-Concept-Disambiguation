Mammalian engineers drive soil microbial communities and ecosystem functions across a disturbance gradient
Synthesis: Our study suggests that soil disturbance by animals may offset, to some degree, the oft-reported negative effects of grazing induced-disturbance on soil function. Further, our results suggest that most of this effect will be derived from echidnas, with little positive effects due to rabbits. Activities that enhance the habitat for echidnas or reduce rabbit populations are likely to have a positive effect on soil function in these systems. This article is protected by copyright.
