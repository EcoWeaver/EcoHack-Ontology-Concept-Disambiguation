Open geospatial technology standards and their potential in plant pest risk management--GPS-enabled mobile phones utilising open geospatial technology standards Web Feature Service Transactions support the fighting of fire blight in Norway
The threat posed by invasive alien species to global crop production and biodiversity is recognized as one of the major drivers of global change today. Here we report on a successful implementation and operational use of new technology to support risk- and crisis management in the case of fighting an invasive plant disease. The open geospatial standards Web Feature Service Transaction (WFS-T) was implemented in software for GPS-enabled mobile phones communicating with a GeoServer backend in order to track down and eradicate disease outbreaks and susceptible host plants. This new technology offering georeferenced events online from field provides new possibilities for real time action in risk and crisis management.Research highlights> GPS enabled mobile phones supports pest risk management. > Remote editing of geographical data over the internet from the field. > Linking Open geospatial technology standards with networking GPS devices.
