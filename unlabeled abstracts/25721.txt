Allelopathic activity of Elodea canadensis and Elodea nuttallii against epiphytes and phytoplankton
Elodea nuttallii and Elodea canadensis have both been introduced from North America to Europe. They are now common in many water bodies where they often form dominating stands. It was suggested that negative relationships between Elodea and phytoplankton or epiphytic covers exist, probably due to the release of growth inhibiting allelochemicals. This would be an effective strategy to avoid light limitation caused by algae and cyanobacteria. We investigated the allelopathic potential of both E. nuttallii and E. canadensis against different photoautotrophs, focussing on epiphytic algae and cyanobacteria isolated from different submersed macrophytes and culture strains. Methanolic extracts of both species inhibited the growth of most of these organisms. Only a culture strain of Scenedesmus brevispina was stimulated. Further separation of extracts yielded several active fractions, indicating that hydrophilic and slightly lipophilic compounds were responsible for growth reduction. At least some of the activity seems to be related to phenolic substances, but flavonoids in these species are inactive. Since growth declined also in a moderately lipophilic fraction of culture filtrate of E. nuttallii, we assume that active compounds were exuded in the water. Allelopathy might thus be relevant in situ and suppress cyanobacteria and algae. We furthermore found differences in the susceptibility of target organisms, which could (1) at least partly be a result of adaptation to the respective host plants and (2) indicate that allelopathic interference might reduce the abundance of some species, especially cyanobacteria, in epiphytic biofilms.
