Effects of introduced exotic tree species on growth, consumption and assimilation rates of the soil detritivore Porcellio dilatatus (Crustacea: Isopoda)
The food value of the exotic tree species Eucalyptus globulus and Acacia longifolia for Porcellio dilatatus was assessed in comparison with that of autochthonous species (alder, pine and oak). Growth rates (GR) were higher for animals feeding on alder leaves, followed by those feeding on eucalyptus, pine, oak and acacia. Animals feeding on acacia leaves maintained a constant low weight, with almost no weight gain, during most of the study period. Significant differences were detected among all litter types, with the exception of pine and oak leaves. Consumption rates (Cr), Assimilation rates (Ar) and Assimilation efficiency (AE) followed a different pattern from growth data, with isopods feeding on pine and on the two exotics showing the highest values. These were followed by isopods feeding on alder and oak leaves, with very low assimilation efficiency being recorded on the latter leaf type. Nevertheless, Growth efficiency (GE) was high for isopods feeding on oak compared with alder and eucalyptus, and very low for those feeding on acacia and pine. The differences in the parameters measured are discussed in relation to leaf characteristics (nitrogen and total phenolic contents, fungal biomass and leaf resistance).
