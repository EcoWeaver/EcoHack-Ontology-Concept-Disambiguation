Impact of weirs on fish communities in a piedmont stream
The impact of large dams on fish communities is much better documented than that of weirs. This paper investigates the influence of weirs on fish community patterns along a piedmont river (the River Viaur). Presence/absence of species was obtained distant from a weir (NW), and immediately downstream (DW) and immediately upstream (UW) of the weir. More than half of the species captured were non-native, probably introduced when upstream reservoirs were built. Most of these species were eurytopic or limnophilic. Species richness at UW sites and the number of introduced species found at each site did not depend on the distance from the source (DFS). UW sites had more introduced and limnophilic species than NW sites. Conversely, NW had more rheophilic species than UW. Furthermore, total species richness (SRT) was higher at DW than NW suggesting a direct influence of the weir on the downstream community. UW sites were characterized by the presence of tench, roach and bleak which were scarce in NW sites where brown trout predominated. Weirs appear to modify habitat to favour the colonization of introduced species, and therefore have influenced the structure of fish communities. The study underlines the importance of local conditions in artificially-influenced rivers. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
