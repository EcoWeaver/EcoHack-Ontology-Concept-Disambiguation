Autocidal Technology for the Control of Invasive Fish
Recombinant genetic technology offers considerable potential for the safe, cost-effective control of invasive fish. This article reviews the range of genetic approaches suggested for controlling invasive species, and considers their practicality, likely efficacy, and the risks they entail. Implementation of any genetic method to control invasive fish will be heavily influenced by an as yet unknown level of public acceptability and a regulatory and policy framework for managing environmental applications of genetic technology that is confused at almost all jurisdictional levels.
