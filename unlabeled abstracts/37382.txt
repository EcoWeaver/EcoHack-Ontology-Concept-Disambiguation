Why was the invasion of the river Rhine byCorophium curvispinumandCorbiculaspecies so successful?
In 1987 the amphipod Corophium curvispinum was discovered for the first time in the river Rhine. Two years later it was the dominant macroinvertebrate in the lower and middle Rhine system. It is still extending its range: it has been found in several canals carrying Rhine water, as well as in the IJsselmeer. The mussels Corbicula fluminea and Corbicula fluviatilis also appeared in the Rhine in 1987 and now occur commonly throughout the lower and middle Rhine system. The authors discuss three issues which together seem to be responsible for the success of these three species as immigrants: 1) their innate properties as immigrants; 2) the present ecological conditions in the river Rhine system; and 3) the timing of the immigration. The physical and chemical degradation of the river environment has been followed by a decline of the original flora and fauna. The present biotic community has been reduced to a set of hardy, non-demanding species; nearly all specialized fluviatilous species have disappeared or have become very rare, although some such species have begun to return recently with the improvement of water quality which has been taking place since the 1970s. -from Authors
