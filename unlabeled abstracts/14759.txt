Non-native freshwater fish species in China
Non-native fishes are regarded as a serious threat to freshwater biodiversity. However, little information exists about non-native freshwater fish in China. This study compiled an inventory of non-native freshwater fish species in China based on various sources. The inventory includes a total of 439 freshwater fish species belonging to 22 orders, 67 families, and 256 genera. The four most dominant orders were Perciformes, Characiformes, Siluriformes, and Cypriniformes, accounting for 38.50 14.81 13.90, and 11.16 % of the non-native freshwater fish in China, respectively. Over one-third of non-native freshwater fish species were of South American origin (35.54 %), followed by Asian (23.01 %), and African (21.41 %) origins. The aquarium and aquaculture industries are the two main vectors responsible for the introduction of non-native fish species into China. The status and potential impacts of most non-native fishes are uncertain. This study summarizes the known ecological and economic effects of non-native freshwater fishes in China. The results demonstrate that there are enormous positive and negative impacts of non-native fishes on the economy, and that some non-native species are potential threats to humans and biodiversity in China. Therefore, more attention should be focused on non-native fishes in China in the future.
