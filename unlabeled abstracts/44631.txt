Spartina alterniflora Invasion Enhances Dissimilatory Nitrate Reduction to Ammonium (DNRA) Rates in the Yangtze River Estuary, China
Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) can save N by converting nitrate into ammonium and avoiding nitrate leaching and runoff in saltmarshes. However, little is known about the effects of invasive plants on DNRA in the upper and deeper soil layers in salt marshes. Here, we investigated DNRA rates in the soils of six different depth layers (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50, and 50-100 cm) from the invasive Spartina alterniflora marshland, two native plants Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis marshlands, and bare mudflat on Chongming Island, located in the Yangtze River Estuary, China. Our results show that S. alterniflora significantly increased DNRA rates in both the upper 50 cm soil and deeper 50-100 cm soil layers. With respect to the entire soil profile, the NO3- reduction content calculated from DNRA in S. alterniflora marshland was 502.84 g N m-2 yr-1, increased by 47.10%, 49.42%, and 38.57% compared to bare mudflat, S. mariquete, and P. australis, respectively. Moreover, NO3- reduction content from the 50-100 cm soil layers was almost identical to that in the upper 50 cm of the soil. In the month of May, DNRA is primarily regulated by SO42- and pH in the upper and deeper soil layers, respectively, whereas, in the month of October, soil pH accounted for the most variables of DNRA in both the upper and deeper soil layers. Altogether, these results from a new perspective confirm that S. alterniflora invasion increases soil N pool and may further push its invasion in salt marshes, and the importance of deeper soil in nitrogen cycling cannot be ignored.
