Charcoal anatomy of Brazilian species. II. 15 native species occurring in Atlantic or Amazon rainforest
Anthracology is the identification of charcoal remains through wood anatomy. Paleoecological and paleoethnobotanical evidence from anthracological studies provides information on past environments as well as the fuel economy and use of plants by those living in ancient societies. Historical ecology and forest conservation can also accrue from findings in anthracological studies. Charcoal identification must rely on adequate reference material, in particular reference collections and descriptions of charcoal anatomy. This paper presents charcoal anatomy descriptions of fifteen Brazilian native species that occur in the Atlantic Forest and the Amazon Rainforest. The charcoal anatomy of six of these species is here described for the first time. Samples were analyzed under a reflected light microscope; the descriptions followed the procedures and terminology recommended by the International Association of Wood Anatomists. Increased knowledge of the charcoal and wood anatomy of native tropical species may improve taxonomic identification, thereby increasing accordingly the amount and quality of data for sociocultural inferences about past societies. In addition, it contributes to a better knowledge of the native flora, which helps to prevent deforestation and to drive more sustainable charcoal production chains.
