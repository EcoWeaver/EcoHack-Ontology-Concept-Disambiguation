Multi level ecological fitting: indirect life cycles are not a barrier to host switching and invasion
The biosphere is currently experiencing rapid ecological changes driven in large part by a suite of anthropogenic processes including movement, consumption, production and land use. Such large-scale environmental disturbance, now and throughout earth's history, forces large-scale biotic mixing by introducing new species to new areas, which can produce new, evolutionarily novel host-parasite associations (Brooks & McLennan 2002; Brooks & Ferrao 2005; Woolhouse et al. 2005; Brooks & Hoberg 2007; Hoberg & Brooks 2008, 2010; Agosta et al. 2010; Winkler et al. 2009; Hoberg 2010; Kutz et al. 2014) This article is protected by copyright.
