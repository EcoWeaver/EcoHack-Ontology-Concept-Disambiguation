Response of the European Ladybird Adalia bipunctata and the Invasive Harmonia axyridis to a Neonicotinoid and a Reduced-Risk Insecticide
The spread of the multicolored Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in Europe coincided with the decline of the native Adalia bipunctata (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). Both species are predators of aphids in orchards, and differential susceptibility to insecticides used to control fruit pests may contribute to explain the competitive advantage of the invasive over the native species. In this study, the insecticidal activity of imidacloprid and spinetoram was tested on third instars and adults of both ladybird species under laboratory conditions. Insects were exposed to insecticide residues on potted peach plants that were sprayed with the maximum recommended field doses (100 mg/liter for imidacloprid and 66.67 mg/liter for spinetoram). Mortality was scored after short (2 d for both stages) and long (7 and 10 d for adults and larvae, respectively) exposure periods. The susceptibility to the insecticides was very similar for H. axyridis and A. bipunctata. Imidacloprid caused a significant increase in the mortality of both stages of the two species for every exposure period. On the other hand, when exposed to spinetoram residues, larvae and adults of both ladybirds did not show higher mortality than controls after short and long exposure periods. The pest suppression provided by ladybirds, which could be severely hampered by the applications of nonselective pesticides, might be enhanced by the adoption of reduced-risk insecticides, selective for these beneficial insects.
