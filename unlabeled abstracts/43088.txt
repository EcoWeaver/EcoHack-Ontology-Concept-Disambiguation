Feral Pigs in the Western Cape Province: Failure of a Potentially Invasive Species
The status of feral pig (Sus scrofa) colonies in the western Cape Province of South Africa was ascertained from the literature and from unpublished records. Of 12 colonies established during the last century, only six are extant. The populations of two of the extant colonies have decreased during the last three decades and the ranges of all six seem to be static. The invasive potential of feral pigs in the Cape is low when compared with that in other parts of the world (Australia and the United States).
