Evaluation of rotary drum composting for the management of invasive weed Mikania micrantha Kunth and its toxicity assessment
Mikania micrantha Kunth is an abhorrent weed that destroys agricultural output. It contains toxic compounds that are detrimental to the natural ecosystem and have negative impacts on the economic and aesthetic aspects of the environment. This study depicts the treatment and management of this plant by in-vessel composting using a 550 L rotary drum composter. Six different mix proportions of biomass, cow dung, and sawdust were used for the study. Rotary drum (RD2) with 2.71% has the highest Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN). Total Organic Carbon (TOC) decreased to 19.72% at the end of the 20th day. Final C/N ratio falls between 7-14 in all the reactors. The phytotoxicity test of Mikania was evaluated using Vigna radiata and Allium cepa. The findings of the study suggest that Mikania can be efficiently utilised to produce mature and stable compost that might be recommended for field application as the process can reduce toxicity.
