The potential for biodiversity offsetting to fund invasive species eradications on islands.
Balancing development and biodiversity conservation presents significant challenges. One approach, biodiversity offsetting, represents "measurable conservation outcomes resulting from actions designed to compensate for significant residual adverse biodiversity impacts resulting from project development", and is a final step in a mitigation hierarchy following steps of avoidance, minimization, rehabilitation and restoration (Business and Biodiversity Offsets Programme 2012). Norton and Warburton (2015) use the main islands of New Zealand as a case study to provide a well-reasoned assessment of the potential for biodiversity offsetting to fund invasive alien species (IAS) control. They identify seven key conditions that must be met to satisfy the approach: "be technically possible to reduce invasive species to levels that enhance native biodiversity; be affordable; be sufficiently large to compensate for the impact; be adaptable to accommodate new strategic and tactical developments while not compromising biodiversity outcomes; acknowledge uncertainties associated with managing pests; be based on an explicit risk assessment that identifies the cost of not achieving target outcomes; and include financial mechanisms to provide for in-perpetuity funding".This article is protected by copyright.
