Australia: small steps to control invasives.
We believe that there are more obvious and less destructive options for controlling gamba grass and other invasive weeds in Australia than introducing mega-herbivores such as elephants (Nature 482, 30; 2012). Biological control using carefully screened host-specific arthropods or pathogens, combined with quarantine and spread-prevention measures, is a more balanced approach, and one with which Australia has considerable experience. The world is littered with examples of generalist vertebrate species (cane toads, foxes, mynas, mosquito fish and so on) that were introduced in the misguided hope of controlling a pest species, only to have a substantial undesired impact on native biodiversity. Credible solutions to these problems are more likely to come from small things done well, rather than through elephantine, rhinocerine, or even asinine fixes.
