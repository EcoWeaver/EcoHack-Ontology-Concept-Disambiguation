Dust pollen distribution on a continental scale and its relation to present-day vegetation along north-south transects in east China
A series of dust pollen samples was collected along N-S transects in east China (18degN to 53degN latitudes). Sample sites extend from the cold-temperate zone in the north to the tropical region in the south. Pollen taxa characterize each region and reflect the natural and devastated vegetation as well as corresponding climatic zones. The quantitative pollen data can be used to estimate the spatial distribution of planted and introduced species. Valuable information of human disturbance of the natural forest is evaluated by quantitative comparison between dust pollen and in-situ pollen of protected forest. In addition, percentages of grass pollen vary regularly from north to south that is consistent with spatial distribution of net primary productivity in east China. Among all grasses, Artemisia and the Gramineae carry the clearest signal: their ratio increases northwards and therefore represent a suitable and convenient tool for palaeoclimate reconstructions.
