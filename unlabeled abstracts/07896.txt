Reproductive biology of the invasive Asian freshwater leech Barbronia weberi (Blanchard, 1897)
Barbronia weberi were collected from Hydrilla verticillata purchased from aquarium suppliers in Melbourne, Australia and additional B.weberi were obtained from aquatic plants in Canberra, ACT, Australia. Adult leeches fed Tubifex sp. adlibitum successfully reproduced under laboratory conditions (215C ). Reproductively mature B.weberi produced cocoons every week for up to three months at which time the adults began to senesce. Cocoons contained one to five (barx=2.410.78 SD, N=58) eggs with juveniles leaving the cocoon within 273.4 SD days (N=13) of cocoon production. Juvenile B.weberi reached reproductive maturity within four months (N=7) of hatching and had a maximum growth rate of 1.10mm2d-1 once they left the cocoon at around 30 days. Individual egg volume (r=0.63, scaling exponent =1.21) and cocoon volume (r=0.65, scaling exponent =1.24) showed a significant (PB.weberi to rapidly invade new localities.
