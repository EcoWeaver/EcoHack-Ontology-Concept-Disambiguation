Climate matching drives spread rate but not establishment success in recent unintentional bird introductions
Significance The awareness of the negative consequences of biological invasions and the critical importance of evidence-based decision making have led to a persistent effort to understand the factors driving the successful invasion of exotic species and to predict invasion outcome. We assess, taking advantage of an exceptionally comprehensive dataset of exotic birds in the Iberian Peninsula, the role of different factors in the invasion success of current avian introductions. Our findings contrast with the evidence previously found in studies mostly based on deliberate introductions regarding factors influencing the invasion success of birds and show that drivers controlling the establishment and spread stages are markedly different. Our results also highlight certain challenges for managing current invasions.
