First record of round goby, Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814) in the Sava River, Croatia
In June 2011, 34 specimens of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) were caught at three different locations in the Sava River in Croatia, which is a first record of this invasive species in Danube tributaries in Croatia. Size, structure and condition of populations indicate that the species is well adjusted to its new habitat and that further range expansions are highly likely.
