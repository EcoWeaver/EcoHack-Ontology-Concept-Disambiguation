First Record Of The Non-Native Pacu, Piaractus Brachypomus, In Lago Peten-Itza, Guatemala, Central America
We documented the first record of the non-native species Piaractus brachypomus (Characiformes: Serrasalmidae) in Lago Peten-Itza, Peten, Guatemala. One brined specimen was donated by a local fisherman in San Benito, El Peten. The captured specimen was reportedly collected in the southern basin of the lake. We used the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI) to validate identity of the specimen. We hypothesize that the local aquarium trade is the most likely source of introduction of the non-native Pacu in Lago Peten-Itza.
