Study isssues of invasive species of the genus Solidago
The impact of invasive species on the ecosystems belongs to the most important environmental problems. Representatives of the genus Solidago actively invade various plant communities. About 2300 literary sources were analyzed in order to determine the main tasks for the researchers of invasive species of this genus and to highlight the most relevant issues. Ambiguous evidence of the inhibitory effect of goldenrod on native flora species has been observed. Some studies report on the invasion of species of the genus Solidago and the displacement of species of local flora in various natural and climatic conditions. Opposite opinion states that the main changes relate not to taxonomic, but to the functional diversity. The allelopathic effect may be influenced both by edaphic factors and by the stage of plant development, as well as by the flora diversity in different regions and by the mutual influence of these factors. Most likely, essential oil components (terpenes and terpenoids) have an inhibitory effect on competing plants and soil microorganisms.
