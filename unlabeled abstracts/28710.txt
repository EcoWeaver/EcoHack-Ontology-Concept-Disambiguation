Identification of Gobio populations in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula: first record of the non-native Languedoc gudgeon Gobio occitaniae (Teleostei, Cyprinidae)
All Iberian populations of the genus Gobio have been ascribed to G. lozanoi to date. In northeastern (NE) Iberian catchments, the Gobio populations are not native and several species may have been involved in the introductions. To identify the species present, specimens were collected in several Ebro River and NE Iberian catchments. Their identification revealed the presence of two species, G. occitaniae and G. lozanoi, the former being the first record in the Iberian Peninsula. Gobio occitaniae was reported from one Ebro tributary and three NE Iberian catchments. The possible negative effects caused by competitive interactions between introduced Gobio species and native fish may warrant management actions to control or eradicate introduced populations.
