Phenotypic plasticity of an invasive weedAmbrosia artemisiifoliaL. in agrobiocenoses of the South of Russia
Invasive weeds are characterized by high phenotypic plasticity, which allows them to adapt to new climatic conditions due to variable phenotypes that have arisen in the historical time scale under the control of natural selection. Colonization of such plants takes place locally in accessible anthropogenic cenoses. In the South of Russia the most typical invasive plant isAmbrosia artemosiifoliaL. We We examined the discrete variation by vegetative feature -- shoot length according to 12 genotypes of ragweed in agrocenoses of Krasnodar Krai.
