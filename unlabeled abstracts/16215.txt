An analysis of soil free-living and plant-parasitic nematode communities in three habitats invaded by Heracleum sosnowskyi in central Lithuania
Knowledge of the main effects of plant invasions on soil microfauna is essential for a better understanding of the process of these invasions. Heracleum sosnowskyi is the second most important invasive Heracleum species in Europe. We studied the composition of soil nematode communities in three different habitats invaded or uninvaded by H. sosnowskyi: abandoned land, grassland on a roadside slope and the edge of afforested land. We hypothesized that changes caused by the invasion of H. sosnowskyi in native habitats would reduce nematode abundances and species diversity and affect the trophic structure of the nematode communities. A total of 24 soil samples were collected, and 117 nematode species belonging to 77 genera were identified. Ecological indices and nematode community structure, abundance, dominance and taxonomic diversity differed significantly between invaded and control plots. Nematode abundance and species diversity were lower in the habitats where H. sosnowskyi had become established, and the taxonomic compositions of free-living and plant-parasitic nematode communities differed from those of the controls. Plant-parasitic nematodes were the trophic group that differed the most in all habitats, and bacterivorous and root-fungivorous nematode populations were significantly higher in the invaded habitats.
