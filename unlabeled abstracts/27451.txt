Phenotypic Shifts in Life History Traits Influence Invasion Success of Goldfish in the Yarlung Tsangpo River, Tibet
Goldfish Carassius auratus have been established in myriad ecosystems outside of their native ranges, and part of their successful establishment in new ecosystems might be attributed to the shift in life history traits. To explore the role of phenotypic shifts in Goldfish invasions, we quantified and compared spawning times and growth rates in the early life history of nonnative Goldfish from Chabalang and Chongdui wetlands in the Yarlung Tsangpo River basin. Spawning of nonnative Goldfish began on March 20 and April 14 for the Chabalang and the Chongdui populations, respectively, and both were considerably earlier than native populations despite the cold environments in the Yarlung Tsangpo River basin. Growth rates for the Chabalang population were significantly higher than those for the Chongdui population during the first 14 d posthatch; however, growth rates for the Chongdui population became higher after the 37th day. Within the Chabalang population, Goldfish hatching later had faster growth rates than individuals hatching earlier. Consequently, it seems that shifts in the timing of spawning and growth rates play an important role in the invasion success of Goldfish in extremely cold climates.
