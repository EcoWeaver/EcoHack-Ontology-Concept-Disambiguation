Bionomics of the established exotic mosquito species Aedes koreicus in Belgium, Europe
Adults of an exotic mosquito, Aedes (Finlaya) koreicus (Edwards) (Diptera: Culicidae) were identified by morphology and genotyping from one site in Belgium in 2008. In late summer of that year, the occurrence of adults and immature stages reconfirmed its presence. This is the first record of this species outside its native range and in particular in Europe. Two subsites of the original location were prospected from April until October 2009 with different traps to evaluate the extent of its presence and establishment in the area and to understand the dynamics of the species' population. Next to Ae. koreicus, 15 other mosquito species were collected. Adult individuals of Ae. koreicus were found from May to September and larvae were still found early October. Larvae were mainly retrieved from artificial containers both in 2008 as in 2009. Containers with eggs and/or larvae were found up to 4 km away from the initial location, indicating the species is spreading locally. Though the introduction route is unknown, it may have occurred via international trade as a large industrial center was located nearby. A comparison of different climatic variables between locations in Belgium with Ae. koreicus and putative source locations in South Korea, revealed similarities between winter temperatures and the number of freezing days and nights in four consecutive years (2004-2008), while humidity and precipitation values differed strongly. The introduction of a new potential disease vector into Europe seems to be a result of proper entrance points, created by intense worldwide trade and suitable environmental conditions.
