Newcomers in the Baltic Sea: an attempt to trace the origins and whereabouts of thicklip grey mullet Chelon labrosus
In recent years, thicklip grey mullet Chelon labrosus has shown increasing expansion of its native habitats in the north-eastern Atlantic into northerly adjacent areas including the North Sea and the brackish Baltic Sea. Despite the regular annual and seasonal occurrence of C.labrosus in the western Baltic during the warm months, nothing is known of the origin or whereabouts of the mullet during the cold season. As different possible migration scenarios can be considered, we performed otolith microchemistry analyses on specimens from the western Baltic Sea to identify the origin of this nonindigenous species. Comparison with North Sea samples revealed common habitat preferences and underlined the highly euryhaline nature of C.labrosus in different recently occupied habitats. Occasional fluctuations of Sr/Ca ratio along the growth axis suggest periodical migration between waters of different salinities but did not reveal distinct migration pathways.
