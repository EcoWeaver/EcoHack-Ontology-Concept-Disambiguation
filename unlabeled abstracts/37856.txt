First record of exotic alligator gar, Atractosteus spatula (Actinopterygii: Lepisosteiformes: Lepisosteidae), from Ganga River system, India: A possible threat to indigenous riverine fish diversity
A new record of an exotic alligator gar, Atractosteus spatula (Lacepede, 1803), from an open wetland of the Ganga River was presented in this paper and discussed along with the environmental parameters. Entry of the exotic fish into the natural system was probably a result of uncontrolled ornamental fish trading. Considering threats of this predatory fish to become invasive and disturb riverine fish diversity, possible ways to avoid such risk have been discussed.
