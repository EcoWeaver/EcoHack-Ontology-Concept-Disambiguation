Discovery ofLobesia botrana([Denis & Schiffermuller]) in California: An Invasive Species New to North America (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)
The European grape vine moth, Lobesia botrana ([Denis and Schiffermuller]), is one of the most destructive pests of grape in the Palearctic Region. Larvae feed on fruit, causing direct damage and promoting secondary infection by Botrytis cinerea Persoon (botrytis bunch rot or gray mold). On September 30, 2009, tortricid larvae damaging grapes in the Napa Valley of California were identified as L. botrana, representing the first records of this species in North America. The presence of L. botrana could have a significant impact on California agriculture-- wine, table, and raisin grapes are grown on more than 800,000 acres throughout the state. We provide descriptions and illustrations to aid in the identification of this newly arrived pest, along with a brief history of its discovery.
