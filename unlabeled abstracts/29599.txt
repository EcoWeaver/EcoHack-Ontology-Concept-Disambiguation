Mixed fitness effects of grass endophytes modulate impact of enemy release and rapid evolution in an invasive grass
Endophytic fungi in grasses are often considered to be mutualistic because they can increase host resistance to herbivory and drought. However, not all endophytes are beneficial to their hosts, but may instead be specialist enemies. Brachypodium sylvaticum is an invasive grass in the USA. In its European native range, it is nearly always infected by the host-specific endophyte Epichloe sylvatica. While this fungus decreases herbivory, it also decreases the growth rate and size of infected plants, making them less competitive. After showing that B. sylvaticum has lost its endophyte in the invaded range, we use greenhouse assays to deconfound the effects of endophyte infection and range origin to test assumption of the evolution of increased competitive abilities (EICA) hypothesis. Brachypodium in its invaded range appears to have lost tolerance mechanisms present in the native range, allowing Epichloe to greatly increase seedling mortality and reduce growth rates. Additionally, there is some evidence for increased competitive abilities in the form of increased seedling growth rates in the invasive range. Together, these results provide strong support of the EICA hypothesis.
