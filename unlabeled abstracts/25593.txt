Genesis of epizootics involving introduced species of helminths, mammals, and mollusks
The functioning of two foci of helminth diseases caused by trematodes Apophallus muehlingi and Rossicotrema donicum has been studied in the Volga Delta. The origin of these foci is related to the expansion of species ranges of Lithoglyphus snails, intermediate hosts of trematodes. Introduced mammal species, the raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides and American mink Mustela vision, are involved in the circulation of the invasion.
