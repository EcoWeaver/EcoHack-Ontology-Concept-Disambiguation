Seed viability and seed dormancy of non-native Phragmites australis in suburbanized and forested watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay, USA
The non-native, invasive haplotype of Phragmites australis is rapidly invading tidal and non-tidal wetlands across North America. Phragmites has the potential to spread by seeds and rhizomes. Seed viability and dormancy differences were quantified among 18 patches of non-native Phragmites in subestuarine wetlands in developed (i.e., suburbanized) vs. forested watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay. We used tetrazolium and germination assays to assess seed viability and compared germination percentages and rate of germination among fresh seeds, cold-moist treated seeds, and warm-dry treated seeds to evaluate seed dormancy. Seed viability was
