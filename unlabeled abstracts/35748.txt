Species Diversity and Assemblages of Cerambycidae in the Aftermath of the Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buptrestidae) Invasion in Riparian Forests of Southern Michigan
Extensive ash (Fraxinus spp.) mortality has been reported across much of the area in eastern North America invaded by emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), but indirect effects of emerald ash borer invasion on native forest insects are not well-studied. We assessed cerambycid beetle (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) species captured in baited cross-vane panel traps during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. Traps were placed in 12 riparian forest sites distributed across three watersheds selected to represent the temporal gradient of the emerald ash borer invasion from southeastern to southwestern Michigan. Although ash species originally dominated overstory vegetation in all sites, >85% of ash basal area has been killed by emerald ash borer. We captured a total of 3,645 beetles representing 65 species and five subfamilies. Species assemblages in southeast sites, with the longest history of emerald ash borer invasion, differed from those in south central and southwest Michigan, which were similar. These differences were largely due to three species, which accounted for >60% of beetle captures in southeast Michigan. Associations among site-related variables and beetle captures indicated cerambycid species assemblages were associated most strongly with abundance and decay stage of coarse woody debris. During both years, >90% of cerambycid species were captured by midsummer but seasonal activity differed among and within tribes. Numbers of beetles captured by canopy and ground traps were similar but species richness was higher in canopy traps than ground traps. Results suggest inputs of emerald ash borer-killed ash can have temporally lagged, secondary effects on cerambycid communities.
