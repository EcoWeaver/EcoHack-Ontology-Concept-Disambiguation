Re-Connection of Oxbow Lakes as an Effective Measure of River Restoration
Six years after re-connection of an oxbow lake from periodically to permanently connected to the main channel, the restoration success was assessed. This permanently connected oxbow lake was compared with the main channel of the Elbe River and with a periodically connected oxbow lake by means of comparisons of the aquatic macroinvertebrates, fish and aquatic macrophyte communities. The permanently connected oxbow was suited as important replacement habitat for riverine invertebrates, especially for clubtails (Odonata) and unionid mussels (Bivalvia). The periodically connected oxbow lake was colonized by typical species for shallow lakes. As expected, riverine species did not occur. Meanwhile, the invertebrate community in the main channel was poor and dominated by invasive species (Dikerogammarus villosus, Dreissena polymorpha). The results concerning fish showed a clear dominance of the rheophilic species spined loach (Cobitis taenia) in the permanently connected oxbow lake and of the indifferent species roach (Rutilus rutilus) and European perch (Perca fluviatilis) in the periodically connected oxbow lake. However, species number was highest in the main channel. For macrophytes, quantity, number of taxa and growth forms and diversity were lower in the permanently compared to the periodically connected oxbow lake. In conclusion, the re-connection of oxbow lakes to main channels can be an important measure for native species conservation, especially macroinvertebrates, and hence for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive.
