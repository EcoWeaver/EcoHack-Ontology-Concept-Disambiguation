Invasion of Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Italy: Assessment via analysis of genetic variability and herbarium data
Investigations of the genetic pattern and colonisation sources and the routes of invasion by alien species populations are crucial for identifying invasion mechanisms and the reasons for the bio-ecological success of invasive species. The aim of our work was to study the genetic pattern of Italian populations of Ambrosia artemisiifolia in comparison with that of some French and Canadian populations and to use herbarium records to characterise the colonisation areas of A. artemisiifolia across Italy. Molecular investigations were based on a set of nuclear SSR marker loci, which we used to analyse a number of Italian, Canadian and France populations. The time-spatial spread of A. artemisiifolia was reconstructed through the distributional pathway of 194 herbarium specimens.
