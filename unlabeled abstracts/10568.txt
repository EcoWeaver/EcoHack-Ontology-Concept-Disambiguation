Nematodes from raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides viverrinus) introduced recently on Yakushima Island, Japan.
Nematodes were collected from 14 raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides viverrinus) on Yakushima Island, Kagoshima Prefecture (Kyushu), Japan, that were the progeny of recently introduced animals to this World Natural Heritage Area, probably within the last 2 decades. Seven nematode species (Toxocara tanuki, Ancylostoma kusimaense, Arthrostoma miyazakiense, Strongyloides planiceps, Trichuris vulpis, Gongylonema sp., and Dirofilaria immitis) were collected from the raccoon dogs. Two nematode species (Molineus legerae and Strongyloides martis) were collected from 2 Japanese weasels (Mustela itatsi) indigenous to this island that were killed by traffic accidents. Considering that foxes and other carnivores, except for weasels, dogs and cats, are not distributed on this island, most of soil-borne nematodes such as roundworms, hookworms, and threadworms in raccoon dogs should have been introduced by the original population from the mainland Japan, and the infection hence maintained at a high level by new generations. Recovery of the third-stage larvae of Gongylonema sp. from the esophagus of raccoon dogs was remarkably frequent (79%), suggesting that the animals might vigorously take insect hosts. Although S. martis have never been recorded from weasels in Japan until this study, this threadworm might be prevalent in a variety of mustelids in Eurasia.
