Intraguild predation byHarmonia axyridis(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) on native insects in Europe: molecular detection from field samples
Intraguild predation (IGP) is a potential mechanism of negative effects on native species populations by invasive non-native species such as Harmonia axyridis. Molecular techniques (polymerase chain reaction) were used to probe for the presence of various insect (coccinellid, syrphid and chrysopid) prey DNA in the guts of 177 H. axyridis larvae field-collected in England, France, Germany, Slovakia and the Czech Republic in 2010. Three of the four target prey species were detected in the guts of H. axyridis at the following rates: Adalia decempunctata 9.6%, Adalia bipunctata 2.8% and Episyrphus balteatus 2.8%. IGP on Chrysoperla carnea was not detected. IGP detection of at least one target species was made in England, France, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, but not in Germany. These results strengthen the evidence that H. axyridis is a very generalist predator. Results are discussed in the context of their ecological significance.
