Australian wattle species in the Drakensberg region of South Africa - An invasive alien or a natural resource?
An investigation into the spread of two alien wattle species (Acacia mearnsii and Acacia dealbata) in rural parts of the Drakensberg region of South Africa and the importance of the trees to the livelihoods of the local communities was carried out. With the aid of aerial photography two plots near the village were selected. Wattle aerial cover increased from 7% and 20% in the two plots, respectively, in 1953, over 21% and 33% in 1975, to 48% and 58% in 2000. In 1995, a government-sponsored national programme, "Working for Water" was established, with the expressed purpose of employing people described as being from the poorest and disadvantaged rural communities to clear areas of invasive alien species from river catchments and water courses. Whilst the programme provides an income to thousands of families in rural areas, it may also be jeopardising the livelihoods of the same communities.
