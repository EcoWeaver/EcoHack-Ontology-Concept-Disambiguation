Pollen limitation in invasive populations of Solanum rostratum and its relationship to population size
Aims Small plant populations may be more likely to suffer more severe pollen limitation due to the lower number of potential mates or suitable pollinators. For invasive species, this phenomenon may be more common when an invading population colonizes a new habitat. Here, we investigated whether pollen limitation occurs in invasive populations of Solanum rostratum during its invasion from North America to China and evaluated the patterns between pollen limitation and population size. Methods Pollen addition experiments were performed on six invasive populations of S. rostratum. By comparing fruit set and seed production with open pollination treatment, we calculated the index of pollen limitation and regressed it to population size and density. Important Findings Among the six sampled invasive populations of S. rostratum, the fruit set and seed production per fruit were 0.346+-0.014 and 52.38+-9.29, respectively, with open pollination treatment and 0.572+-0.022 and 56.28+-10.79, respectively, with pollen addition treatment. Compared with open pollination, pollen addition significantly increased fruit set and seed production by 65.3 and 7.4%, respectively. The standardized index of pollen limitation ranged from 0.022 to 0.125, with an average of 0.065, suggesting that invasive populations of S. rostratum do suffer from pollen limitation. The index of pollen limitation was negatively correlated with population size, which is consistent with the pattern that smaller populations suffer from more severe pollen limitation.
