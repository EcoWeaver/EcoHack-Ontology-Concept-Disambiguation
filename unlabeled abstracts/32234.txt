Experimental removal of invasive Africanized honey bees increased breeding population size of the endangered Lear's macaw
Invasive Africanized honey bees potentially compete with cavity-nesting birds in South America. However, the impacts caused by this competition and its conservation consequences to threatened species are poorly known. We quantified the presence of these bees and assessed its competition for cliff cavities used by nesting Lear's macaws Anodorhynchus leari , a globally endangered parrot endemic to the Caatinga biome of Brazil. We treated bee hives with permethrin by shooting them with a crossbow bolt which distributed the compound upon impact. When feasible, we removed the comb and applied an insecticide (fipronil) to deter bee recolonization. We subsequently surveyed the macaw breeding population to verify whether our treatment allowed for the nest recruitment in cavities previously occupied by bees. We recorded >100 bee hives in the nesting cliffs. Hives outnumbered the macaw nests tenfold in two areas recently recolonized by the macaws. Cavities occupied by bees were significantly higher than those occupied by macaws, suggesting macaws may be forced to breed in lower cavities. None of the untreated bee-cavities (n = 50) were occupied by nesting macaws, while 15% of treated cavities (n = 52) were occupied within two years post treatment. Treated cavities occupied by macaws were significantly higher than those not occupied. Hive management was responsible for 71% of the macaw breeding population increase. Experimental hive treatments were effective in restoring nesting resources lost due to bee infestation. An intensive and continued eradication program is recommended to enhance macaw's habitat restoration, facilitating its expansion into historical areas.
