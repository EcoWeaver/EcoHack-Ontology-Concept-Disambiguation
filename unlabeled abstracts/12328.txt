Environmental stress mediates trophic cascade strength and resistance to invasion
Although much attention has focused on the drivers of trophic cascade strength among systems (e.g., habitat type, body size, predator, and prey thermy) comparatively little is known of how trophic cascades change within systems, especially with respect to gradients in environmental stress. To address this, we measured the strength of a trophic cascade across an estuarine stress gradient and tested the predictions of "consumer stress model" that suggests sensitivity to stress is greater in mobile consumers relative to sessile prey. We used field observations and experimental manipulations within a central California estuary (Tomales Bay), where higher water temperatures in summer/fall and lower salinity during winter/spring may differentially affect predators (native crabs), meso-consumers (invasive oyster drills), and sessile prey (native oysters). Our results demonstrate that sites with high environmental stress (warmer and lower salinity waters) excluded top predators from the food web, which facilitated high densities of oyster drills and resulted in low oyster survival. In contrast, less stressful sites (cooler and higher salinity waters) had high crab densities leading to reduced oyster drill survival and high oyster survival (an indirect positive effect). Observational data from 14 field sites along both margins of Tomales Bay are consistent with the results of experimental manipulations. This study highlights the importance of environmental stress in mediating within system trophic cascade strength by altering top predator abundance. Our results support the predictions of the consumer stress model and suggest that increasing environmental stress (warming and variable salinity regimes) as a result of climate change may decouple species interactions. Furthermore, warming and extreme low salinities may indirectly intensify the negative effects of non-native species by reducing the biotic resistance provided by native predators.
