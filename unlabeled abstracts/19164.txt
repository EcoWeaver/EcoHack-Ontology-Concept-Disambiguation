Resurrection of the genusLicorniaforScrupocellaria jolloisii(Bryozoa) and related species, with documentation ofL. jolloisiias a non-indigenous species in the western Atlantic
Recent studies of the large cheilostome bryozoan genusScrupocellariahave shown a greater degree of taxonomically informative morphological variation in zooids, opesia, and polymorphic structures than previously recognized. Only one subgenus has been named within the genus,Retiscrupocellariad'Hondt, 1988, erected forScrupocellaria jolloisii. In this work we further analyseS. jolloisiiand its related species, resurrecting an earlier genus name,Licorniavan Beneden, 1850 forLicornia jolloisii, and nine relatives,L. annectens,L. cervicornis,L. cyclostoma,L. diadema,L. ferox,L. gaspari,L. longispinosa,L. macropora, andL. prolata.Licornia jolloisiiwas originally described from the Red Sea, and most species of the genus occur in the Indo-Pacific region. The species, however, has now been found in the Western Atlantic, in the Florida Keys, US, and in Bahia de Todos Santos, Brazil.
