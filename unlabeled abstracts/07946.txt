INTRODUCED AND NATIVE LEAFHOPPERS COMMON TO THE OLD AND NEW WORLDS (RHYNCHOTA: HOMOPTERA: CICADELLIDAE)
AbstractFourteen new records of introduced leafhoppers are added to the 157 leafhoppers previously recorded as occurring in both the Old and New worlds. Of these, 62 were erroneously recorded previously although 12 of the European species subsequently have been found in North America. Two North American species have been introduced into Europe, and one European species has been found in South America; North America has received 61 species from Europe, 3 from Asia, and 1 from Africa. One pan-tropical species is probably a recent introduction into the Caribbean from the Old World. There are 30 transboreal leafhoppers, 5 transarctic species inhabiting the tundra and alpine meadows, and 9 inhabiting temperate regions of both Eurasia and North America.The Aster leafhopper (Macrosteles quadrilineatus Forbes) is removed from synonymy with the transboreal sedge-feeding M. fascifrons (Stal) and 25 other confused species are distinguished in the genera Aphrodes, Euscelis, Evacanthus, Limotettix, Macrosteles, and Typhlocyba. These include 11 new species: Evacanthus bellaustralis, E. chlamidatus, E. grandipes, E. lacunar, E. nigramericanus, E. ustanucha, Macrosteles lagus, M. severini, M. tesselatus, M. vilbastei, and Typhlocyba frigida, all from North America, Balclutha punctata confluens Rey and Limotettix striola ferganensis Dubovsky are elevated to species status. One new generic synonymy, 23 new specific synonymies, and 3 new combinations are created.
