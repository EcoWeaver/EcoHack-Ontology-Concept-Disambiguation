Eradication of feral goats enhances expansion of the invasive shrubLeucaena leucocephalaon Nakoudo-jima, an oceanic island
Many introduced species can co-exist within the same ecosystem and sometimes interact with each other. Under such situations, eradication of one species may cause unexpected negative effects. Nakoudo-jima in the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands is an oceanic island that had feral goats that were introduced in the 1880s, but eradicated in 1999. Following their eradication, the alien invasive shrub Leucaena leucocephala (Fabaceae) was predicted to increase drastically. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the eradication of feral goats enhanced the expansion of L. leucocephala using four time-series aerial photographs and validation work based on current field surveys of Nakoudo-jima. Our results showed that following feral goat elimination, bare ground areas decreased and forest cover increased. This was particularly true of areas dominated by L. leucocephala. Thus, feral goats appear to have limited the expansion of L. leucocephala on Nakoudo-jima. Grassland cover also increased following feral goat elimination, but this may have occurred prior to L. leucocephala expansion. These results suggest that L. leucocephala-dominated forest might invade grassland areas and that grasslands may have mediated the expansion of L. leucocephala after feral goat elimination. Future management of L. leucocephala should target the species in the high-risk expansion zones adjacent to grasslands.
