Fishing pressure and species traits affect stream fish invasions both directly and indirectly
Aim We sought to identify direct and indirect effects of factors contributing to establishment and spread of 272 stream fish species. Location Two hundred and ninety-seven watersheds in the eastern United States. Methods We modelled two variables: (1) whether a species had become established outside its native range (establishment) and (2) the number of watersheds in which species established outside their native range (spread). We estimated these variables by comparing historical distributions to a rich data set of contemporary sampling. We calculated metrics of human use (indexing propagule pressure), and gathered species trait data from an open-access database. We then used piecewise path analysis to estimate direct and indirect effects of human use, native range size and species traits on the two metrics of species introductions. Results We identified a hierarchical causal structure in which native range size and fishing pressure were important direct determinants of introductions. Species traits had some direct effects, but played a more indirect role. Native range size was significantly affected by thermal tolerance and diet breadth. Likewise, fishing pressure was significantly affected by life history strategy: larger-bodied, longer-living and more fecund species were positively associated with fishing pressure. Main conclusions Functional traits can confer an advantage to some species during the establishment phase, but human use is important for subsequent dispersal throughout the non-native range. However, human use is non-random, and is largely a function of species traits. Considering both direct and indirect effects of traits across stages of the invasion process can help to elucidate the full role of traits in species invasions.
