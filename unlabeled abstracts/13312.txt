Offshore marine renewable energy devices as stepping stones across biogeographical boundaries
1. Offshore renewable technology is likely to provide an increasing component of our energy supply. We still have limited understanding of the potential environmental impacts of these developments, particularly as we move to larger scales. The surfaces provided by devices offer novel habitat to marine organisms, which may use these sites to spread to new areas. 2. We used coupled biological and hydrodynamic models to investigate the spread of intertidal marine organisms with pelagic larvae in the region around the south western coast of Scotland. We assessed the impact of novel habitat on the spread of organisms and its role in allowing the transgression of physical barriers to dispersal. 3. Model renewable energy device sites provided habitat for pelagic larval particles that would otherwise have been lost offshore. They also provided a source of larvae for existing coastal sites. 4. Many offshore devices fulfilled both source and sink (or intermediate connection) roles creating new dispersal pathways, and in particular allowing (previously impossible) northward dispersal from the Northern Irish coast to Scotland. 5. Synthesis and Applications. New habitat close to biogeographic barriers has implications for existing species' distributions and genetic population structure. It also affects the spread of non-native species, and "climate migrants". Monitoring these sites for the presence of such species will be important in determining the future ecology of our shores, and in maintaining economic aquaculture and marina operations. We outline an approach to the selection of sites for monitoring.
