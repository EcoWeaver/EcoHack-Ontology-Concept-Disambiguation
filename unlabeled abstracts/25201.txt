Reconstructing the lionfish invasion: insights into Greater Caribbean biogeography
Aim Lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles) are popular ornamental fishes native to the Indo-Pacific that were introduced into Florida waters and are rapidly spreading and establishing throughout the Western Atlantic (WA). Although unfortunate, this invasion provides an excellent system in which to test hypotheses on conservation biology and marine biogeography. The goals of this study are: (1) to document the geographical extent of P. volitans and P. miles; (2) to determine whether the progression of the lionfish invasion is the result of expansion following the initial introduction event or the consequence of multiple introductions at various WA locations; and (3) to analyse the chronology of the invasion in conjunction with the genetic data in order to provide real-time assessments of hypotheses of marine biogeography.
