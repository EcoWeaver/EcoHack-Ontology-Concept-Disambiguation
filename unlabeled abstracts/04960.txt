Identification of chemical constituents and larvicidal activity of essential oil from Murraya exotica L. (Rutaceae) against Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae).
This study was conducted to evaluate the phytochemical composition and larvicidal effect of leaf essential oil from Murraya exotica against early fourth-instar larvae of Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus. Gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses revealed that the essential oil contained 27 components. The major chemical components identified were b-humulene (40.62 %), benzyl benzoate (23.96 %), b-caryophyllene (7.05 %) and a-terpinene (5.66 %). The larval mortality was observed after 12 and 24 h of exposure period. The results revealed that essential oil showed varied levels of larvicidal activity against A. aegypti, A. stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus. After 12 h of exposure period, the larvicidal activities were LC50 = 74.7 and LC90 = 152.7 ppm (A. aegypti), LC50 = 56.3 and LC90 = 107.8 ppm (A. stephensi ), and LC50 = 74.4 and LC90 = 136.9 ppm (C. quinquefasciatus) and the larvicidal activities after 24 h of exposure period were LC50 = 35.8 and LC90 = 85.4 ppm (A. aegypti), LC50 = 31.3 and LC90 = 75.1 ppm (A. stephensi), and LC50 = 43.2 and LC90 = 103.2 ppm (C. quinquefasciatus). These results suggest that leaf essential oil from M. exotica is a promising and eco-friendly source of natural larvicidal agent against A. aegypti, A. stephensi and C. quinquefasciatus.
