Effect of river water exposition on adhesion and invasion abilities of Salmonella Oranienburg and Saintpaul.
This study was performed to evaluate in vitro the adherence and invasiveness capacity of Salmonella Oranienburg and Saintpaul (isolated from river water) exposed to laboratory and river water growth conditions and inoculated into epithelial HEp-2 cell. Results showed that Salmonella Oranienburg and Salmonella Saintpaul showed lower ability to adhere and invade epithelial HEp-2 cells under both growth conditions as compared to Salmonella Typhimurium reference strain. S. Oranienburg adhesion capacity was not affected by the growth conditions, while S. Saintpaul exposed to river water significantly (p < 0.05) decreased its adhesion capacity by 75.7 %. On the contrary, S. Oranienburg exposed to river water reduced its invasion efficiency by 80 %, whereas S. Saintpaul showed no differences between growth conditions. In conclusion, this study suggests that the exposure to non-host conditions, such as river water, adversely affects the adhesion and invasiveness of Salmonella serotypes differently, impacting on their ability to re-enter a new host.
