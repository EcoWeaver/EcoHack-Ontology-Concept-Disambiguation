Characterization of microsatellite loci in the European green crab (Carcinus maenas)
Carcinus maenas (Decapoda: Portunidae) has proven a highly successful invasive marine species whose potential economic and ecological impacts are of great concern worldwide. Here, we characterize 14 polymorphic microsatellite loci in C. maenas and its sister species Carcinus aestuarii. These markers will prove useful for fine-scale genetic analyses of native and introduced populations, for assessment of the sources and routes of invasion and for evaluation of post-invasion population dynamics.
