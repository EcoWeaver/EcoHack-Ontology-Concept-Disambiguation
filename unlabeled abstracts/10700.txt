Variation among Desert Topminnows in Their Susceptibility to Attack by Exotic Parasites
Of the problems facing managers of biodiversity, none may be as difficult to correct as exotic species (Coblentz 1990; Soule 1990). Exotics can directly affect the viability of native species through competition, predation, and habitat alteration (Simberloff 1981; Coblentz 1990; Soule 1990), and they pose an additional threat if they harbor parasites and pathogens that also attack native species. For example, oxen probably introduced rinderpest to Africa, where the disease caused high mortality in wild and domestic ungulates (Ford 1971). Indigenous North and South American people were decimated by the introduction of smallpox by European colonists (Crosby 1972). Parasites associated with an introduced sturgeon (Acipenser stellaturs) devastated populations of a native species (A. nudiventris) in the Aral Sea (Bauer & Hoffman 1976).
