Host Range of Herpetogramma basalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), a Biological Control Agent for the Invasive Weed Alternanthera philoxeroides (Centrospermae: Amaranthaceae) in China
Abstract Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb. is an invasive herbaceous amphibious weed species in China. A pyralid moth Herpetogramma basalis (Walker) was discovered feeding on A. philoxeroides through field surveys and may be a potentially useful biocontrol agent. To determine the host range of H. basalis and evaluate its potential to control A. philoxeroides, no-choice and multiple-choice tests were conducted. Herpetogramma basalis fed on target weeds and 29 nontarget plant species. In addition to the target weed A. philoxeroides, H. basalis developed to adult on eight other nontarget species. Herpetogramma basalis survived to adulthood successfully on A. philoxeroides and less successfully on several other Amaranthaceae species. In multiple-choice studies, H. basalis showed a strong oviposition preference for A. philoxeroides over Amaranthus tricolor L. (Centrospermae: Amaranthaceae). Amaranthus tricolor was the only crop plant that supported the complete development of H. basalis. We cautiously recommend H. basalis for the biological control of A. philoxeroides in China.
