Invasion by Pittosporum undulatum of the Forests of Central Victoria. III. Effects of Temperature and Light on Growth and Drought Resistance
The clumping of invading seedlings of Pittosporum undulatum Vent. around the butts of established trees is due partly to the site-dependent survival of seedlings. particularly during summer. P. undulatum seedlings were very drought-tolerant when grown at moderately low temperatures (21.4degC day/17.8degC night compared with 27.4degC day/23.9degC night) and in deep shade. Plants droughted at 5degC higher temperatures and higher photon flux densities stopped transpiring and wilted 10-13 days earlier than those droughted under cooler, densely shaded conditions. Well watered seedlings had higher relative growth rates and net assimilation rates when grown under higher temperatures and photon flux densities. Control seedlings were more leafy when grown under low light. as reflected by the specific leaf area, leaf area ratio and root/shoot ratios. The adverse effects of higher photon flux densities and temperatures on the drought tolerance of P. undulatum seedlings support the hypothesis that survlval of invading seedlings in their first year is dependent on the microclimate.
