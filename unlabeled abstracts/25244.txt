Assessment of bioinvasion impacts on a regional scale: a comparative approach
This paper presents an overall bioinvasion impact assessment on the scale of a large marine region--the Baltic Sea, as defined by the Helsinki Commission. The methodology is based on a classification of the abundance and distribution range of alien species and the magnitude of their impacts on native communities, habitats and ecosystem functioning aggregated in a "Biopollution Level" index (BPL) which ranges from 'no impact' (BPL=0) to 'massive impact' (BPL=4). The assessment performed for nine Baltic sub-regions revealed that documented ecological impact is only known for 43 alien species out of 119 registered in the Sea. The highest biopollution (BPL=3, strong impact) occurs in coastal lagoons, inlets and gulfs, and the moderate biopollution (BPL=2)--in the open sea areas. The methodology was also used to classify species into alien (BPL=0) versus 'impacting' species (BPL>0), which can be divided into 'potentially invasive' (BPL=1) and 'invasive' (BPL>1) ones. No clear correlation between the number of established alien and impacting species was found in the sub-regions of the Baltic Sea. The methodology, although requiring a substantial research effort, proved to be useful for interregional comparisons and evaluating the bioinvasion effects of individual alien species.
