Secondary production of introduced Asiatic clam, Corbicula fluminea, in a central Arizona canal
Asiatic clam, Corbicula fluminea, is often a serious pest where introduced and established outside its native range. This includes many canals of the southwestern U.S.A. Because of its potential role in organic matter processing, nutrient dynamics, and sedimentation, the clam is an important component of the benthic community and of the aquatic ecosystems which it inhabits. To better understand the ecology of Corbicula in canals, secondary production and life history of an introduced population of clams in a small, earthen canal in the Phoenix metropolitan area, central Arizona, were studied over a 12-month period in 1981-1982. Clams had a monthly mean density of 2 255 m-2, single annual spawning, 2 year life span, and overlapping cohorts. Annual secondary production (size-frequency method) was 25.62 g DM m-2 and cohort production (composite Allen curve) was 29.32 g DM m-2, with turnover ratios of 2.70 and 5.81, respectively. These are among the highest known single-species estimates for molluscs, and illustrate the importance of clams in these unique southwestern aquatic systems.
