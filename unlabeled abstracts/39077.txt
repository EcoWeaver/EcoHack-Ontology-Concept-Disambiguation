Is Antarctica under threat of alien species invasion?
The paper by Hughes et al. 2020 summarizes the results of a recent workshop at which taxonomic and Antarctic experts from nine nations (Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States) met to undertake a horizon scanning exercise (Sutherland et al., 2011; Roy et al., 2014; 2018). The goal of the workshop was to identify alien species and to derive a list of potentially invasive non-indigenous species that present the highest risk to Antarctic biota over the next ten years. They also identified the most likely vectors and routes for the introduction of alien organisms beyond the Polar Front border. At the top of the list are marine invertebrates that can be accidentally transported in the ballast water of vessels. The threat is all the greater, since a large number of cruise ships travel from the Northern Hemisphere to Antarctica, with some of them working consecutive Arctic/ Antarctic summers to take advantage of ice-strengthened or ice-breaking capabilities. This can increase the probability of introduction of non-native species with pre-adaptations to survive in cold environments (Chwedorzewska et al. 2013). Alien marine species may interact with other anthropogenic stressors affecting Antarctic ecosystems, such as increases in water temperature, ocean acidification and pollution, with irreversible consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services (McCarthy et al. 2019).
