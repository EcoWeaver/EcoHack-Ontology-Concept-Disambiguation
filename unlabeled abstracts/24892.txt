The ecological barriers to the recovery of bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides(L.) Druce) infested sites: Impacts on vegetation and the potential increase in other exotic species
Abstract To protect native biodiversity from environmental weeds, the impacts that these weeds cause need to be known before weed control commences. Asparagus asparagoides (L.) Druce (bridal creeper) (Asparagaceae) is a serious environmental weed and has been selected for biological control in Australia. To predict the responses of plant communities to the control of bridal creeper, a prerelease baseline of the impacts of bridal creeper on native plant communities was undertaken. Plant assemblages in areas invaded by bridal creeper were compared with reference areas that contained little or no bridal creeper. Areas invaded by bridal creeper contained 52% fewer native plant species when compared with nearby reference areas. However, there was no difference in the number of other exotic plant species between areas. Similar trends were found for the germinable seed bank. Although a greater number of exotic species were present in the seed bank compared with the vegetation surveys, there was still no difference between areas with and without bridal creeper. In a glasshouse trial, exotic species germinated more frequently compared with native species. This could indicate that as bridal creeper density decreases following control, exotic species have an advantage over native species when colonizing areas left vacant by bridal creeper. Second, as bridal creeper areas contained reduced native species richness and cover, they may be susceptible to further weed invasion after bridal creeper is removed. Therefore, simply reducing the presence of bridal creeper may not guarantee successful restoration of invaded areas and additional restoration efforts will be needed to ensure the ultimate goal of protecting native biodiversity is reached.
