Pheromone Production by an Invasive Bark Beetle Varies with Monoterpene Composition of its Naive Host.
The secondary chemistry of host plants can have cascading impacts on the establishment of new insect herbivore populations, their long-term population dynamics, and their invasion potential in novel habitats. Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) has recently expanded its range into jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) forests in western Canada. We investigated whether variations in jack pine monoterpenes affect beetle pheromone production, as the beetle's primary aggregation pheromone, (-)-trans-verbenol, and anti-aggregation pheromone, (-)-verbenone, are synthesized from the host monoterpene a-pinene. We collected jack pine bolts from five Canadian provinces east of the beetle's current range, introduced live D. ponderosae into them, and characterized their monoterpene compositions. We then measured production of (-)-trans-verbenol and (-)-verbenone emitted by beetles to determine whether pheromone production varies with monoterpene composition of jack pines. Depending on particular ratios of major monoterpenes in host phloem, we classified jack pine into three monoterpenoid groups characterized by high amounts of (+)-a-pinene, 3-carene or more moderate blend of monoterpenes, and found that beetle pheromone production varied among these groups. Specifically, beetles reared in trees characterized by high (+)-a-pinene produced the most (-)-trans-verbenol and (-)-verbenone while beetles in trees characterized by high 3-carene produced the least. Our results indicate that pheromone production by D. ponderosae will remain a viable aspect and important predictor of its survival and persistence in the boreal forest.
