Agastache Rugosa (Lamiaceae), A New Casual Alien In The Flora Of Poland
Abstract In September 2014, the casual occurrence of Agastache rugosa in Poland was confirmed. It was found on a ground heap between fallow and arable fields in Lbiska near Zalesie Gorne in the community of Piaseczno, the Masovian Voivodeship (coordinates: 52deg1'33.06'' N, 21deg0'27.72'' E; the ATPOL cartogram unit: ED46). This rare species of Asian origin is cultivated in bee-plant gardens of some beekeepers in Poland. The map of distribution and mode of introduction with garden waste from horticultural farms were presented.
