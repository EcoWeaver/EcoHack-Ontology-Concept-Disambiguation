An indirect effect of biological invasions: the effect of zebra mussel fouling on parasitisation of unionid mussels by bitterling fish
Invasive species represent a major threat with both direct and indirect effects on natural ecosystems, including effects on established and coevolved relationships. In a series of experiments, we examined how the interaction between two native species, a unionid mussel (Unio pictorum) and the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), a fish that parasitises unionids, was affected by the non-native zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). The zebra mussel fouls hard substrates, including shells of living unionids, and its presence is often associated with a decrease in population density of native unionid mussels. Bitterling lay their eggs into live unionids and the embryos develop inside their gills. Using a range of zebra mussel densities, we demonstrated that zebra mussel fouling had a negative effect on the number of bitterling eggs inside the mussel host, with abundances of 5-10 zebra mussels (shell size 15-25 mm) per unionid critical for bitterling ability to utilise the host. In a further experiment, we found that bitterling did not discriminate between unfouled unionids and those fouled with five zebra mussels. Most ovipositions into fouled hosts, however, were unsuccessful as eggs failed to reach the unionid gills. We discuss implications of such unsuccessful ovipositions for bitterling recruitment and population dynamics.
