Non-random patterns and temporal trends (1912-2012) in the transport, introduction and establishment of exotic birds in Spain and Portugal
Invasion processes are probably better understood for birds than for any other taxon, thanks to detailed information available on deliberate introductions performed by Europeans when they colonized other continents. Little is known, however, about current avian introductions in developed countries, including Europe. Using an unprecedented dataset on exotic birds, we assessed the sources and magnitude of recent avian introductions and characterized the transitions between main invasion stages (transport, introduction and establishment) and their temporal evolution.
