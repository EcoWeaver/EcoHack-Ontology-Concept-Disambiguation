Genetic and environmental implications of reintroducing laboratory-raised unionid mussels to the wild
The reintroduction of endangered species is a potentially useful conservation strategy, which in the case of freshwater unionid mussels, must be preceded by the successful laboratory rearing of juvenile mussels on their host fishes. However, an understanding of the genetic and environmental implications of reintroductions of artificially propagated mussels is required. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of information on these issues with respect to freshwater mussels. In general, regarding the genetic effects of reintroductions, small founder populations may lead to low heterozygosity (reduced genetic variability) in the reintroduced populations, which can make them more susceptible to extinction. Captive breeding programs may also alter the genetic composition of species through artificial selection, whether intentional or unintentional. Captive breeding may also affect an individual's interactions with conspecifics or predators by altering behaviour. Genetic problems in reintroduced populations also have the potential to affect wild populations, particularly by reducing variability among populations of the same species and eliminating local adaptation. There is also the possibility that diseases, parasites, or exotic species may be spread when populations are relocated or augmented. Recommendations related to the minimization of these impacts are presented for freshwater mussels, with the recognition that many of the issues will require additional study.
