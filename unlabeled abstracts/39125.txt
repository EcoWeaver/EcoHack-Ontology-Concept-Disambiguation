Inhibition of harmful algae Phaeocystis globosa and Prorocentrum donghaiense by extracts of coastal invasive plant Spartina alterniflora
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) and the invasion of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) have become important environmental problems in intertidal zones of China, which caused serious damage on the coastal ecological systems. By using S. alterniflora as algaecide, this helps to utilize this invasive plant, in addition, is expected to help to control the expansion of S. alterniflora. The potential of S. alterniflora in HABs mitigation was investigated on controlling Phaeocystis globosa (haptophyceae) and Prorocentrum donghaiense (dinophyceae). The growth of both HABs species was significantly inhibited at high concentrations, and P. globosa was more sensitive than P. donghaiense. Furthermore, the extracts of S. alterniflora reduced the effective quantum yield, photosynthetic efficiency, and relative maximal electron transport rate of both algal species at high concentrations, which implies a disruption on their photosynthetic system. Flavonoids, which were previously known as antialgal chemicals, were found to be abundant in the extracts of S. alterniflora by UPLC-MS detection. Our results revealed that the potential of S. alterniflora as a novel antialgal agent for controlling HABs, simultaneously, resource utilization possibility for the invasive plant S. alterniflora.
