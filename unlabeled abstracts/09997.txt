Nematocysts of the invasive hydroid Cordylophora caspia (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa).
Although there is significant genetic diversity among populations of the hydroid Cordylophora caspia, the species has not been split into multiple species or subspecies, in part because its members also show great physiological and morphological plasticity. This plasticity makes new taxonomic units hard to define or identify and obscures the connection between historically used names and the genetically defined clades. We explore variation in nematocysts, a character system not previously assessed in Cordylophora but which has demonstrated phylogenetic signal in other cnidarian taxa. We measured more than 5000 capsules from 112 individuals belonging to 14 populations, including representatives of the major genetic lineages. We found no correlation between the size range of capsules and either clade or salinity. Thus, for C. caspia, nematocysts are neither phenotypically plastic with respect to salinity nor taxonomically informative. Nematocyst size and density in particular tissues may be correlated to other environmental factors (such as prey type, size, and abundance in the location of each population) and may aid in distinguishing more distantly related species.
