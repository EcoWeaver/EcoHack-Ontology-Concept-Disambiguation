First report of Epichrysocharis burwelli in Europe, a new invasive gall wasp atacking eucalypts
Epichrysocharis burwelli (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) was detected in Portugal, infesting the leaves of lemon-scented gum, Corymbia citriodora (Myrtaceae), in four out of seven sampled locations, along Tagus river, between the region of Lisbon and Castelo Branco. This is the first record of this alien gall wasp in Europe and in the Palaearctic region. An unidentified species of genus Closterocerus, which is not known from Europe, was found parasitizing the larvae of E. burwelli. A copy of the paper is available at: http://rdcu.be/kMmH
