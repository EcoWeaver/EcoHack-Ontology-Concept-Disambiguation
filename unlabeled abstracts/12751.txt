Invasion success in polyploids: the role of inbreeding in the contrasting colonization abilities of diploid versus tetraploid populations ofCentaurea stoebes.l
1.As a consequence of founder effects, inbreeding can hamper colonization success: Firstly, in species with self-incompatibility controlled by an S-locus, inbreeding may decrease cross-compatibility, mainly due to the sharing of identical S-alleles between closely related mating partners. Secondly, inbreeding can reduce fitness of inbred relative to outbred offspring (i.e. inbreeding depression). Polyploids often show reduced inbreeding depression compared to diploids, which may contribute to the overrepresentation of polyploids among invasive species. This is the first study that tests how the effects of inbreeding differ between geo-cytotypes (i.e. ploidy levels within a given range).
