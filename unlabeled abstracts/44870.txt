Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope compositions provide new insights into the phenotypic plasticity of the invasive species Carpobrotus sp. pl. in different coastal habitats
The genus Carpobrotus N.E.Br. comprises several aggressive invasive species that threaten biodiversity in coastal areas worldwide. We studied the phenotypic plasticity of Carpobrotus sp. pl. invading four coastal habitats in the north-western Iberian Peninsula (coastal cliffs, disturbed areas, dunes and coastal forests). We measured morphological traits and carbon (d13C) and nitrogen (d15N) stable isotope compositions of Carpobrotus sp. pl. individuals collected in each habitat. Our results indicated that leaf carbon content (% C) and dry shoot weight were higher on cliffs and lower in mixed forests. In contrast, leaf hydration was higher in mixed forests and lower on cliffs. Leaf nitrogen content (% N) was higher in forests, which might be due to the presence of Acacia longifolia, an alien tree that accumulates N in the soil through symbiotic associations with N fixing bacteria. Differences in d15N showed the use of different N sources in each habitat. Values were higher in disturbed areas with greater human activity and lower on cliffs and forests. d13C was higher in cliffs and dunes, suggesting CAM activity where drought and salinity are more intense. Water use efficiency (iWUE) and d13C were higher on cliffs and dunes, suggesting an adaptation and high tolerance of Carpobrotus sp. pl. to unfavourable conditions such as drought or salinity in the invaded areas.
