Indicating botanical diversity--Structural and functional aspects based on case studies from Northern Germany
Richness in species should be appropriately measured in samples of a standard size. Standard plot sizes of 400 m2 were recommended in order to compare the a-diversity between different ecosystem types.For the application of diversity aspects in landscape management, further attributes of the species composition should be considered. The state of the regional and phytocoenological species pool and the relationship between autochthonous and allochthonous species may help to describe the importance and potential risks of biological invasions. Life strategy types reflect the interactions between species trade-offs and environmental constraints. The species preferences for different hemerobic steps may be used as indicators of human impacts especially in agricultural and urban landscapes and ecological indication values for different site qualities. These attributes in combination may help to characterize ecosystem properties and to develop scenarios for succession processes.Biodiversity in its different aspects can only be successfully sustained, if the multitude of biological interactions with the human way of life in and subsiding on ecosystems are considered. The approach of the convention of biodiversity (CBD) based on the 'Malawi Principles' focus on the functional relationships and processes within ecosystems and propagates the use of adaptive management practices at scales appropriate for the issues being addressed. The principles take into account the need for integrative cooperation. A regional application of these principles is necessary for sustainable landscape planning.
