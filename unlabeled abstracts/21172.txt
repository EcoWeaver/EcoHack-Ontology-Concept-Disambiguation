Pathogenicity, characterization and comparative virulence of Rhizoctonia spp. from insect-galled roots of Lepidium draba in Europe
The association of Rhizoctonia spp. with insect-damaged and diseased tissue of the invasive perennial Lepidium draba was documented throughout the range of L. draba that was surveyed in Europe, including Hungary, Austria, Switzerland and France. Samples that could be both maintained under cooled conditions after collection and promptly processed consistently yielded Rhizoctonia solani, 11 isolates of which anastomosed with AG-4, one with AG-2-1 and one isolate was determined to be binucleate. Comparative virulence among the isolates was analyzed using nonparametric survival analysis for interval-censored data. This analysis indicated that there were significant differences among the isolates. These findings provide further evidence that both root-attacking insects and soilborne pathogens are associated with the lower density of a perennial invasive species in its native range. Prioritization of prospective biocontrol agents should include the ability to engage in insect/plant pathogen synergisms. The application of nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation to interval-censored data for the assessment of comparative virulence among several strains of a plant pathogen is more accessible than calculation of the area under the disease progress curve.
