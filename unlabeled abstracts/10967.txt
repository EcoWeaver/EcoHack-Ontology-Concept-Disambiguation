Recent improvements in broodstock management and larviculture in marine species in Polynesia and New Caledonia: genetic and health approaches
Aquaculture production in French Polynesia and New Caledonia relies upon domesticated broodstock of two introduced species (the shrimp Litopenaeus stylirostris, and the fish Lates calcarifer) and on natural stock of the local pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera. For L. stylirostris, refrigeration of shrimp sperm lowers the sanitary risk linked to the re-introduction of variability in Tahiti that is proved necessary by microsatellite markers. They also allow paternity controls that will improve future genetic management. Selective breeding programs for shrimp are underway in Tahiti and under assessment at pilot scale in New Caledonia. Conservation strategies are under elaboration for local populations of P. margaritifera that have been proven genetically differentiated. The recent development of pearl oyster hatcheries is the first step towards genetic improvement of this species. Thanks to geographical isolation and sanitary regulations, French Polynesia and New Caledonia are not affected by the viral outbreaks affecting shrimp elsewhere in the world (e.g., white spot and Taura syndrome viruses) and the pearl oyster in Japan (Akoya virus). Furthermore, a zoosanitary surveillance network of pearl oyster stocks is coming up in order to detect the emergence of any pathogen. Recently, alternative methods for antibiotherapy in shrimp larval rearing have been tested using probiotic bacteria, and could find an application in pearl oyster larval rearing.
