Does energy availability influence classical patterns of spatial variation in exotic species richness?
Aim At macroecological scales, exotic species richness is frequently positively correlated with human population density. Such patterns are typically thought to arise because high human densities are associated with increased introduction effort and/or habitat modification and disturbance. Exotic and native species richness are also frequently positively correlated, although the causal mechanisms remain unclear. Energy availability frequently explains much of the variation in species richness and we test whether such species-energy relationships may influence the relationships of exotic species richness with human population density and native species richness.
