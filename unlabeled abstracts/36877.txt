Non-native prey species supporting fish assemblage biomass in a Neotropical reservoir
The present study aimed to investigate the role of four non-native invertebrates in supporting fish biomass as well as their influence on the carbon flow into the Volta Grande reservoir food web. The fish samples were carried out quarterly between October 2015 and July 2016 using gillnets. At the sampled sites, four non-native invertebrates (golden mussel, Asian clam, trumpet snail and Amazonian prawn), which are potential prey for fish in the Volta Grande reservoir, were collected by targeted sampling using a Petersen-type bottom dredger and semi-circular sieves. The gut contents of the fish were collected and analyzed under stereoscope, and samples of muscle tissue of these fish, as well as the four non-native invertebrate species sampled, were submitted for isotopic analysis. Results obtained by the present study, by both gut content and stable isotopic analyses, pointed to a trophic structure where non-native species represent not only a strong component of the fish community, but also their main carbon source. Based on gut contents and isotopic mixing models, we found that together, non-native prey are essential carbon sources for the fish fauna, fuelling more than 40.0% of the biomass in four dominant fish species. The consumption rate of non-native bivalves by the native omnivorous fish Leporinus friderici suggested these filter-feeding organisms potentially constitute an important trophic connection between littoral consumers and pelagic energy sources. In addition, non-native prey were also prominent carbon sources for non-native fish, fuelling more than half of the biomass in peacock bass and silver croaker, suggesting these prey have a fundamental role in maintaining non-native fish populations in this system. Our results may help to understand fundamental ecological issues bringing to light the extent to which these new combinations of species influence the energy flow and ecosystem properties of the Volta Grande reservoir.
