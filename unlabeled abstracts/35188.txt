Habits and Present Distribution in Florida of the Exotic Ant, Pseudomyrmex mexicanus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)
Pseudomyrmex mexicanus Roger was first collected in Miami, Florida, in 1960; it is now well-established as far north as West Palm Beach on the East Coast and has been taken in Pinellas County on the Gulf Coast. This species commonly nests in hollowed twigs of low shrubs or in the canes of tall herbaceous plants. Much of its food consists of other insects, especially lepidopterous larvae, but apparently includes fungus spores and honeydew. While the worker and queen will sting if held between the fingers, the small colonies and the solitary foraging habit of individual workers precludes the species from becoming a serious nuisance to people.
