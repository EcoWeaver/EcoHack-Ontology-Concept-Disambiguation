Non-native freshwater fish management in Biosphere Reserves
The consideration of non-native freshwater fish species in the management plans of 18 Biosphere Reserves is evaluated. Additionally, impacts caused by introduced freshwater fish species are described. Some measures to alleviate the ecological effects of fish species introductions are proposed, while paying attention to local development as well. The introduction of non-native species may have negative conse-quences for the ecosystems. The analysis of the management plans of the Reserves confirms that non-native freshwater fish species sometimes are not considered in the action plans of the area. Biosphere Reserve's management plans should consider the presence of alien species, with the aim to preserve biodiversity
