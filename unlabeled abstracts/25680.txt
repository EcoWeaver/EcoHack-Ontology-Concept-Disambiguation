Cyanobacterium Nostoc paludosum Kutz as a basis for creation of agriculturally useful microbial associations by the example of bacteria of the genus Rhizobium
Different species of Rhizobium were successfully introduced into the extracellular slime of Nostoc paludosum (Kutz) Elenk, strain 18; cyanobacteria did not eliminate them and exhibited no specificity to the introduced species. Both partners were shown to exist in a self-sufficient manner in an artificial consortium, the stability of which is determined by the technology of growing the cultures in collections. Cyanobacteria act as carriers of introduced satellites, providing contact with the inoculated material through the slime, and increase the nitrogen-fixing ability of legume plants due to the increase of the number and activity of nodules. The fact of penetration of cyanobacterial hormogonia into the nodules has been noted. The treatment of seeds by the consortium resulted in an increase of the harvest as compared with the standard methods of nitragin treatment of legumes.
