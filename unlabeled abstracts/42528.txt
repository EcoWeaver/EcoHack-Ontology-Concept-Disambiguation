Influence of management on vegetative reproduction of invasive species of Helianthus tuberosus in Poodri PLA
Abstract In this article, the authors deal with the influence of management on vegetative reproduction of Helianthus tuberosus, which is invasive plant in the Czech Republic and spreads uncontrollably in the Poodri PLA, where it displaces native plant species. We applied the proposed management (application of herbicides, mowing, engraving) on the study areas and then monitored the condition of the plant tubers.
