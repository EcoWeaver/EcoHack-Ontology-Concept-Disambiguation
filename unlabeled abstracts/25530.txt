Exotic invertebrate species on offshore oil platforms
We report the presence,of 3 exotic invertebrate,species,inhabiting,offshore,oil and gas platforms on the Pacific offshore continental shelf (POeS) of central and southern California, USA. These exotic species,occur in high cover or density and may,negatively,affect populations,of native species on the platforms. Conspicuous,exotic species,(the bryozoan,Watersipora ?subtorquata and the anemone,Diadumene,sp.) were detected on 2 of 7 platforms,surveyed. An inconspicuous,exotic spe cies (the amphipod,Caprella mutica) was detected on 2 of 2 platforms surveyed,fo r such smaller spe cies. In addition to serving as a potential source of exotic species to natural reef habitats, the presence of exotic species,on oil platforms,may,influence,the degree to which,these structures,provide,the eco logical services,of natural reefs. The p resence,of exotic species,on platforms,also has consequences for various,platform,decommissioning,options,in California a nd e lsewhere,(there are an estimated 7000 offshore platformslinstallations worldwide), including the removal and transport of platforms fo r use as artificial reefs, if removals are conducted without regard for the potential transport/dispersal of these species. Furthe r knowledge of the identity of exotic species on oil platforms, their potential for dispersal and interaction with native species, and whether these species can also occur on artifi cial reefs, will improve our understanding of the effects that artificial structures in general have on the ecological functioning,of coastal ecosystems.
