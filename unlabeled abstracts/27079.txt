Habitat Use by Introduced Raccoons and Native Raccoon Dogs in a Deciduous Forest of Japan
We investigated habitat use by introduced raccoons (Procyon lotor) and native raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides albus) in a northern deciduous forest of Japan to examine the relationship between the 2 species. Spatial and temporal habitat use in the forest was monitored using infrared-triggered cameras. We also surveyed environmental factors at 2 spatial scales: at the macrohabitat scale, we examined forest growth stage, forest fragmentation, and distance from a water source; at the microhabitat scale, we examined forest structure, understory vegetation, and beetle abundance. We then analyzed the relationship between environmental factors and habitat use by each species using generalized linear model. Except for fern coverage, most environmental factors at the micro- and macrohabitat scales had different effects on the habitat use of these species. Moreover, the degree of diurnal activity also differed between the species. These spatial and temporal differences in habitat use between raccoons and raccoon dogs provide further evidence that competition between these 2 species may be limited in this area.
