Environmental transcriptomes of invasive dreissena, a model species in ecotoxicology and invasion biology
AbstractDreissenids are established model species for ecological and ecotoxicological studies, since they are sessile and filter feeder organisms and reflect in situ freshwater quality. Despite this strong interest for hydrosystem biomonitoring, omics data are still scarce. In the present study, we achieved full de novo assembly transcriptomes of digestive glands to gain insight into Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis molecular knowledge. Transcriptomes were obtained by Illumina RNA sequencing of seventy-nine organisms issued from fifteen populations inhabiting sites that exhibits multiple freshwater contamination levels and different hydrosystem topographies (open or closed systems). Based on a recent de novo assembly algorithm, we carried out a complete, quality-checked and annotated transcriptomes. The power of the present study lies in the completeness of transcriptomes gathering multipopulational organisms sequencing and its full availability through an open access interface that gives a friendly and ready-to-use access to data. The use of such data for proteogenomic and targeted biological pathway investigations purpose is promising as they are first full transcriptomes for this two Dreissena species.
