Temporal Changes in Codium spp in Lough Hyne with Records for the Southern Irish Coast
Surveys of non-indigenous species (NIS) typically concentrate on the establishment and expansion phases of population dynamics. Our study, in contrast, investigated the status of an invader that has declined to low levels throughout much of the British Isles. The green macroalga Codium fragile ssp. fragile (Suringar) Hariot appeared in the British Isles in the 1800s and probably entered Lough Hyne, County Cork, Ireland in the 1930s. It proliferated on Irish shores in the 1940s to 1970s, but has declined to low levels in the region. Broad-scale surveys in County Cork, SW Ireland (2002-2005) and extensive surveys (2001-2011) within Lough Hyne indicate that the introduced alga has declined substantially since earlier decades. These results are consistent with other studies on NE Atlantic shores indicating a long-term decline.
