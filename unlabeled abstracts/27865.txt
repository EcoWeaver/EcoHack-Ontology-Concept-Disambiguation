Isolation and characterization of six polymorphic microsatellite loci in the western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis (Insecta, Thysanoptera)
Highly polymorphic microsatellite markers can provide important demographic information on founder events and range expansion following initial introduction of invasive insect species. Six microsatellite loci were isolated from an enriched DNA library in order to study the invasion patterns of the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. All loci tested were found to be polymorphic and successfully amplified in all individuals. The number of alleles per locus ranged from five to nine and heterozygosity ranged from 45 to 73%. Some of the loci were also successfully amplified in other thrips species.
