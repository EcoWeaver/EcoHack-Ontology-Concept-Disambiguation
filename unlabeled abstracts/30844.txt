Recent invasion of European red foxes (Vulpes vulpes ) on to Fraser Island (K'gari) and South Stradbroke Island
Invasive predators are globally significant drivers of threatened fauna population decline and extinction, and the early detection of new incursions is critical to the chances of successful predator eradication and fauna conservation. Here, we provide evidence of the recent invasion of European red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) on to two large and internationally significant islands off the southeast coast of Queensland, Australia - Fraser Island (K'gari) and South Stradbroke Island. From camera trap footage collected on Fraser Island since 2009, foxes have now been observed on seven different occasions between 2012 and 2016. Two scats collected on South Stradbroke Island in 2013 and 2014 tested positive for fox DNA (and negative for Canis spp. DNA), with fox presence confirmed by subsequent camera trap footage in 2016. These data confirm the recent incursion of foxes on to these islands and suggest that small populations now exist there. Fraser Island and South Stradbroke Island represent key RAMSAR wetland areas of refuge for populations of multiple threatened fauna that have never been previously been exposed to foxes. Fox impacts on these fauna can only be expected to increase without management intervention to eradicate them before they become widespread.
