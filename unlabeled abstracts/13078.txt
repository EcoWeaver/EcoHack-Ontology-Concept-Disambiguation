Genetic diversity status of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) using SSR markers in Iran
Genetic diversity is vital for the maintenance of genetic pool in cultured shrimps. In order to estimate the current status of genetic diversity in Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp in Iran, as an exotic species, a total of 45 individuals from Amiri and Gorgeaj farms in Jask port of Hormozgan province and one hatchery in Gomishan city of Golestan province, were detected using four microsatellite loci. The number of alleles per locus was 5-10, and the mean effective number of alleles (N e) across populations and loci ranged from 4.834 to 5.148. The overall mean observed heterozygosity (H o) ranged from 0.450 to 0.479, which was lower than the expected one (0.789-0.794). There was nothing remarkable about any of the allele frequencies across populations or loci. The mean inbreeding coefficient (F IS) and pairwise genetic differentiation (F ST) among populations were 41.6 % and 0.133, respectively. The three studied populations departed from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Analysis of molecular variance revealed 14 % variability among and 86 % within populations. However, considering departing from HWE and the high F IS and F, the moderate pairwise F ST values, importance of introducing genetically diverse broodstock and monitoring to control inbreeding is discussed.
