Response of Elodea Nuttallii (Planch.) H. St. John to Manual Harvesting in the North-East of France
Elodea nuttallii (Planch). H. St John is an introduced aquatic macrophyte which was first observed in France in the early 1950s. The impact of two frequencies of harvesting on the biomass and regrowth strategy of this invasive species was evaluated by assessment of morphological traits monthly from February to October 2003. The effect of this management on the floristic biodiversity was also analysed. Harvesting caused a drastic reduction of biomass of E.nuttallii. Two harvests caused almost total disappearance of E.nuttallii. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in the architecture of E.nuttallii between an unharvested site and harvested site. In one year, harvest did not allow the development of native aquatic plants.
