Preliminary phytochemical screening of Lantana camara, L., a major invasive species of Kerala, using different solvents
Plants and plant extracts have important role in modern medicine as their chemical and medicinal constituents are found in natural form. The secondary metabolites represent a large reservoir of structural moieties which work together exhibiting a wide range of biological activities. Plants and plant based products are bases of many modern pharmaceuticals that are currently in use for various diseases. Lantana camara, L., also known as big - sage or wild - sage is one of the major invasive weed in India. Six different solvents viz; distilled water, acetone, alcohol, chloroform, petroleum ether and benzene were used to obtain extracts from powdered leaves and roots of Lantana camara, L. The extracts were subjected to qualitative phytochemical screening using standard procedures. Of the 15 phytochemicals tested, 10 were found in various solvent extracts of Lantana camara, L. By this study, it was confirmed that the selected plant species is a potent source of useful drugs. Present day, particularly in India, Lantana camara, L. is considered as a threat to our biodiversity. So a controlled management is necessary to make use its medicinal use.
