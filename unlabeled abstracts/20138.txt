Pollination of invasive Eichhornia crassipes (Pontederiaceae) by the introduced honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) in South China
Heterostyly functions as an outcrossing mechanism facilitating accurate pollen transfer from anthers to stigmas of particular heights as a result of the behavior of specialist pollinators. However, heterostylous plants are also visited by generalist pollinators, which may affect the plant-pollinator mutualism. Eichhornia crassipes is a tristylous invasive species, with only the mid- and long-styled morphs (M and L) found in China. We recorded flower-visiting insects in Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Nanning in South China. We hand-pollinated the two morphs to determine their compatibility. In addition, by allowing controlled insect pollination in artificial isoplethically monomorphic and bimorphic populations, we undertook a detailed analysis of pollen deposition between the floral morphs, and fruit and seed set. Ranked by relative abundance, the flower-visiting insects were: Apis mellifera, A. cerana, Lasioglossum sp. and Eristalis arvorum. Hand pollination showed that both the M and L morphs were self-compatible, but the former was probably more so than the latter. Intra-morph pollen transfer by A. mellifera within a population was significantly greater than legitimate pollen transfer between populations, suggesting that the pollen exchange between populations was limited. Seed set of the L morph was significantly greater than that of the M morph in monomorphic populations, indicating intra-morph pollen deposition in the former was higher than in the latter. The results showed that A. mellifera was the major pollinator in South China and able to pollinate E. crassipes legitimately and to promote its fruit and seed set, even though high levels of intra-morph pollination occurred.
