Influence of walnut cultivar on infestation by Rhagoletis completa: behavioural and management implications
The walnut husk fly, Rhagoletis completa Cresson (Diptera: Tephritidae), has recently invaded Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and France, probably crossing the alpine divide after its initial introduction into Italy. Here, the susceptibility of 36 walnut [Juglans regia L. (Juglandaceae)] cultivars to attack by R. completa was studied in an experimental orchard in Switzerland. Walnut cultivars differed significantly in infestation rates; cultivars that produced large, heavy fruit harboured significantly more larvae than cultivars that produced smaller fruit. Pupal weight was significantly influenced by cultivar, but not by any of the physical properties that we measured. For individual fruit within a cultivar, pupal weight was weakly related to fruit weight and infestation level. Adult longevity was correlated with pupal weight and appeared to be favoured in flies that developed in large-fruit cultivars. The longevities of adults recovered from different cultivars differed significantly. The shortest longevity was recorded for flies recovered from Geisenheim 1049 (39.2 +- 2.80 days) and the longest for flies recovered from Sheinovo (68.8 +- 21.75 days). Differences in diapause length were also highly significant and varied between 167 +- 5.1 (Esterhazy III) and 257.4 +- 8.21 days (Mayette). These results suggest that (1) across and within cultivars, walnut husk flies prefer to infest (i.e., they develop better in) large, heavy fruit, and (2) offspring that develop in large fruit are likely to accrue fitness advantages over the offspring of females using smaller fruit. Our results provide the basis for subsequent studies on resource defence by males, as they enable a prediction of which type of fruit males should defend more vigorously.
