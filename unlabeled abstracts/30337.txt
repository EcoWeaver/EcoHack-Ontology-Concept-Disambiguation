The onset of invasion of bryozoan Pectinatella magnifica in South Bohemia (Czech Republic)
Pectinatella magnifica is an invasive freshwater bryozoan with ability to produce large colonies reaching a capacity of up to several tens dm3. In the Protected Landscape Area and Biosphere reserve Trebonsko the bryozoan was first found in 2003 in one mesotrophic sandpit. The species gradually spread to many other sites around the Trebon area and at most of these locations its occurrence has invasion properties. Pectinatella expanded to some other sandpits, fishponds without intensive pisciculture. Pectinatella colonies are found mainly on submerged branches of willow trees. The differences between biomass in transects with the occurrence of shrub willow and biomass in transects without their presence were statistically significant in the total biomass weight and the number of colonies. The average weight of several colonies did not differ. The most important parameter affecting the occurrence was the low trophy of water. The water temperature is evidently an important factor affecting the seasonal dynamics of occurence. Differences in nitrogen and phosphorous content between the water outside and inside the colonies were statistically significant. The colonies also accumulate other elements, including microelements.
