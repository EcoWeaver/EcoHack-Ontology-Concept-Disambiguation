Alien taxa of the tribe Senecioneae (Asteraceae) in Italy: a nomenclatural synopsis
Abstract A nomenclatural synopsis of the alien species belonging to the tribe Senecioneae currently recorded in Italy (8 species) is presented. The occurrence at the regional level, as well as the level of naturalization and ecological notes for each taxon are provided. A diagnostic key of the non-native Italian species is also given. The names Cineraria petasitis (now Senecio petasitis), Delairea odorata, Eupatorium auriculatum (now Senecio deltoideus), E. fulvum, Mikania ternifolia var. senecioides, Senecio andryaloides, S. angulatus, and S. leucanthemifolius subsp. vernalis are typified on specimens preserved at E, F, P, SBT, and UPS, and on images by Lamarck, Lemaire, Sims, and Waldstein & Kitaibel. The type of the name S. pterophorus, as indicated by Iamonico in 2015, was wrongly reported as holotype and need to be corrected to lectotype according to the Art. 9.9 of ICN. The names Cacalia auriculata, Cacalia fimbrillifera (nom. nov., nom. superfl. et illeg. pro Eupatorium auriculatum), Cacalia scandens by Thunberg, Cineraria crassiflora, Eupatorium scandens by Link (nom. illeg.), Mikania senecioides (nom. illeg.), Senecio auriculatum, and Senecio mikanioides are also investigated and discussed.
