Structure of littoral zoocenoses in the macroalgae zones of the Neva River Estuary
The biodiversity and spatial distribution of macrofauna biomass are studied for 12 sites of stonesand littoral in the Neva Estuary in 2002-2005. The highest biodiversity has been observed for chironomids and oligochaetes in the Neva Bay (36% and 24% of total species number) and in the eastern Gulf of Finland (33% and 23%). Amphipods (<=89%), molluscs (<=61%), and chironomids (<=37%) dominate by biomass. The biomass spatial distribution vary dramatically from 9 to 37 g m-2 in the freshwater Neva Bay and from 1 to 68 g m-2 for the other Neva Estuary areas. The bottom fauna biomass in the Neva Bay is significantly lower than in the 1980-1990's and constitutes 20-50% of the biomass previously observed. We explain such a significant decrease by a reduction of the insects and aborigine crustaceans Gammarus lacustris Sars and Asellus aquaticus L. The invasive amphipod species Gmelinoides fasciatus (Stebbing) dominated by biomass for the study period (3.8-15.6 g m-2, or>30% of total macrozoobenthos biomass).
