Biology, host specificity and risk assessment ofGargaphia decoris, the first agent to bereleased in South Africa for the biological control ofthe invasive tree Solanum mauritianum
The South American tree Solanummauritianum is a major environmental weed in thehigh-rainfall regions of South Africa and has beentargeted for biological control since 1984. Althoughhost ranges of imported agents determined duringquarantine tests have resulted in the rejection ofeight of the 11 candidate agents tested so far, theleaf-sucking lace bug Gargaphia decoris,imported from Argentina in 1995, displayed anacceptably narrow host range in captivity. No-choicetests showed that G. decoris is confined to Solanum species and cannot survive on solanaceouscrops outside that genus. Although these tests alsoindicated that G. decoris colonies could surviveand reproduce on cultivated eggplant (aubergine) andat least five native South African Solanumspecies, all but one native species proved to beinferior hosts in terms of adult survival andoviposition potential. During paired choice andmultichoice tests in small and larger cagesrespectively, G. decoris displayed very strongfeeding and oviposition preferences for S. mauritianum. Analyses of the risk of attack onnon-target Solanum plants revealed that, withone possible exception, none were likely to suffermore than incidental damage in the field. Host recordsfrom South America have also indicated that G. decoris has not been recorded on any Solanumspecies other than S. mauritianum, providingfurther evidence of its host specificity. The resultsof this study were accepted by the regulatoryauthorities and in February 1999, G. decorisbecame the first agent to be released in South Africafor the biological control of S. mauritianum.
