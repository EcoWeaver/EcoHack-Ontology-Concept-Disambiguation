Ephedra alte(Joint Pine): An Invasive, Problematic Weedy Species in Forestry and Fruit Tree Orchards in Jordan
A field survey was carried out to record plant species climbed byEphedra altein certain parts of Jordan during 2008-2010. Forty species of shrubs, ornamental, fruit, and forest trees belonging to 24 plant families suffered from the climbing habit ofE. alte. Growth of host plants was adversely affected byE. altegrowth that extended over their vegetation. In addition to its possible competition for water and nutrients, the extensive growth it forms over host species prevents photosynthesis, smothers growth and makes plants die underneath the extensive cover. However,E. altedid not climb all plant species, indicating a host preference range. Damaged fruit trees includedAmygdalus communis, Citrus aurantifolia, Ficus carica, Olea europaea, Opuntia ficus-indica, and Punica granatum. Forestry species that were adversely affected includedAcacia cyanophylla, Ceratonia siliqua, Crataegus azarolus, Cupressus sempervirens, Pinus halepensis, Pistacia atlantica, Pistacia palaestina, Quercus coccifera, Quercus infectoria, Retama raetam, Rhamnus palaestina, Rhus tripartita, andZizyphus spina-christi. Woody ornamentals attacked wereAilanthus altissima, Hedera helix, Jasminum fruticans, Jasminum grandiflorum, Nerium oleander, andPyracantha coccinea. Results indicated thatE. alteis a strong competitive for light and can completely smother plants supporting its growth.A. communis, F. carica, R. palaestina, andC. azaroluswere most frequently attacked.
