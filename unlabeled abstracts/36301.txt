Taxonomy, distribution and population structure of invasive Corbiculidae (Mollusca, Bivalvia) in the Suquia River basin, Cordoba, Argentina
Invasive species are one of the most significant causes of biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem services, which underlines the importance of their detection and their study. The Asian clams (Corbiculidae) are invasive organisms that accidentally entered the La Plata River, Argentina, presumably in the 1960s. The objectives of the present study were to identify the corbiculid species and to determine their distribution at several locations along the Suquia River basin, an extended area in central Argentina. In addition, population structure was evaluated monthly during one year, at a site in the city of Cordoba that is characterized by high human influence. The presence of Corbicula fluminea (Muller, 1774) and Corbicula largillierti (Philippi, 1844) in the Suquia River basin is reported for the first time. The former species was found only in a lentic environment (San Roque reservoir), while the latter was also found along the tributary rivers and brooks of the basin. Corbicula largillierti showed variations in average density between the different sites and also in biomass and size classes throughout the study period at the site at Cordoba city. The relative composition of the sediments, flow fluctuation and human pollution may be responsible for the observed differences.
