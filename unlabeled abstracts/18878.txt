Changes in plant species composition within a planted forest in a deciduous agroecosystem in Ghana
Plantations provide a micro-climate that can facilitate the regeneration of other forest species. Often exotic species have been tested for these kinds of functions. To determine the potential for indigenous trees as plantation species for their ability to foster forest species regeneration, this study was undertaken in a mixed indigenous plantation stand. Understories of the stand at 8 years of age were surveyed for plant diversity. The species richness increased by 24% per 1,000 m2 between 2001 and 2008 and the number of families represented increased by 48%. The Shannon Diversity and Simpson Index values confirm a greater diversity 8 years after the plantation was established. The most abundant species in study plots were Chromolaena odorata and Cedrela odorata, which collectively represent about 54% of all species identified in the plots. The most species-rich families were Fabaceae and Euphorbiaceae representing 31% of the total species recorded. Asteraceae and Meliaceae were the two most dominant families, which collectively represent about 55% of all species identified in the plots. 47 forest tree species were found per 1,000 m2 but those classified as 'saplings' occurred in low densities. The 47 tree species included pioneer species such as Entandrophragma angolensis, Milicia excelsa, and Ceiba pentandra. Growth rates of planted species were differed, with half of the tested species having similar growth capacity to the exotic species. Generally, planted indigenous species enhanced habitats for other forest tree species in degraded sites. The observed growth of indigenous species, if planted and protected, shows that they may help in biodiversity recovery within agricultural landscapes.
