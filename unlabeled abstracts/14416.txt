Geographic independence and phylogenetic diversity of red shiner introductions
Identifying areas at risk of invasion can be difficult when the distribution of a non-native species encompasses geographically disjunct regions. Understanding genealogical relationships among native and non-native populations can clarify the origins of fragmented distributions, which in turn can clarify how fast and far a non-native species may spread. We evaluated genetic variation across the native and invasive ranges of red shiner (Cyprinella lutrensis), a minnow known to displace and hybridize with native species, to reconstruct invasion pathways across the United States (USA). Examination of mitochondrial cytochrome-b variation found that native range populations of red shiner fall into four highly divergent lineages that likely warrant species recognition. Introduced red shiner populations in the eastern and western USA are derived from only two of these lineages. Western USA populations originate from the mid-western and western genetic lineages, whereas eastern introductions derive only from the mid-western lineage. Western USA invasive populations exhibit fewer, but more diverse haplotypes compared to eastern USA invasive populations. We also recovered an undescribed, divergent lineage of Cyprinella that has been cryptically introduced into the western USA, which raises the possibility that hybridization has proceeded following secondary contact between previously allopatric lineages. Approximate Bayesian Computation modeling suggests that the disjunct distribution of red shiner across North America is an agglomeration of independent regional invasions with distinct origins, rather than stepwise advance of an invasion front or secondary introductions across regions. Thus localized control may be effective in managing non-native red shiner, including further spread to areas of conservation concern.
