"My garden is the one with no trees:" Residential Lived Experiences of the 2012 Asian Longhorn Beetle Eradication Programme in Kent, England
Studies on the management of biosecurity outbreaks have increased in recent years. Whether these outbreaks affect plant, animal, or human health, there is a strong tendency to employ an "emergency modality" management approach which focuses on speedy eradication and containment. However, there is conflict between rapid response management and prescribed best practices for stakeholder engagement. To explore these tensions, we focus on the 2012 Asian longhorn beetle outbreak and eradication programme in Kent, England. Hailed as a success story by policy leaders, this case study is explored using qualitative research with residents who were directly affected by the eradication. By considering the specific impacts of tree health management on a local level, we recommend that outbreak management programmes take an "open" approach (Leach 2010). This includes focusing on good communication and long term democratic engagement, which are crucial for cultivating trust and promoting biosecure citizenship.
