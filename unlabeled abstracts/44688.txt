Forage palatability of Broussonetia papyrifera an invasive species in Ghana: Relative preference and palatability by sheep and goats
Broussonetia papyrifera is an exotic tree widely grown for paper production. Due to its prolific regeneration it has invaded forestcanopy gaps and degraded farmlands and has now become an invasive species in Ghana. In enhancing its value for use the plantwas evaluated as potential forage for grazing animals vis-a-vis other two existing forage plants: Ficus exasperata and Leucaenaleucocephala.The study assessed the palatability and preference of Broussonetia papyrifera using sheep and goats for the wet anddry seasons.The species were assessed in indoor pen feeding trials using eight-unit (3x3 m) pens with the cafeteria method.The amount of forage offered was 100g (fresh material) in all instances for each species and for ten minutes. Adesign basedon 3x2x2 factorial in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) was used to test the differences in palatability betweenthe three forage species.Results revealed that palatability was higher (P<0.05) in Leucaena leucocephala compared with Ficusexasperata and Broussonetia papyrifera for sheep and goats across seasons. The trend shown might be the result of the effectsof familiarity with the Leucaena leucocephala since animals tend to select plants that are familiar than newly introduced andunfamiliar plants. The study also revealed high level of condensed tannin (CT) in Broussonetia papyrifera which might haveinterfered with forage intake by the animals.There were no significant differences in palatability of Broussonetia papyrifera forgoat in both dry and wet season interactions and Ficus exasperata for goat in both dry and wet season interactions (P>0.05).Thestudy concluded that Broussonetia papyrifera could be a potential feed for both sheep and goats across seasons.The researchrecommended that livestock farmers should incorporate Broussonetia papyrifera feed into their programmes for both sheep andgoats and should be introduced to animals from infancy so that it may become a familiar feed for them.
