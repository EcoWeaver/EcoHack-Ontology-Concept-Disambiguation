Recovery dynamics and invasibility of herbaceous plant communities after exposure to experimental climate extremes
Do climatic extremes increase the invasibility of plant communities, for example through the creation of gaps and the associated local surplus of available resources? To address this question, small experimental communities consisting of three forb species were first subjected to extreme drought and/or heat treatments in different seasons and species mortality and end-of-season biomass were examined. Then, the establishment of new species and their effects on the productivity of the community were recorded in two subsequent years without additional treatments.
