New Neotropical Haplothripini (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae) with a key to Central and South American genera
The tribe Haplothripini includes a large diversity of Thysanoptera-Phlaeothripinae, comprising more than 550 species in about 35 genera. They are characterised by having a maxillary bridge in the head, prosternal basantra well developed and fore wings with a median constriction. Members of this group are present in all geographical regions, but are particularly poorly studied in Central and South America. In this study, we describe a new genus and species, Myrciathrips variabilis gen. et. sp. nov., and a new Haplothrips species; and propose two new combinations: Karnyothrips grassoi (De Santis), and Mirothrips vespicola (De Santis). A key to the nine Haplothripini genera now recognised from Central and South America is provided, together with an updated key to Haplothrips and Mirothrips species. A total of 45 species of Haplothripini are now recognised from Central and South America, and a list of these and their distributions is given. The genera Karnyothrips, Haplothrips and Leptothrips are the most commonly encountered, and some exotic species such as Androthrips ramachandrai and Dolichothrips indicus are now widespread in the Americas.
