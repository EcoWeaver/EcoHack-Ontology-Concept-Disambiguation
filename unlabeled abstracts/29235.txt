Improvement in the outcome of invasive fusariosis in the last decade
Invasive fusariosis has been associated with a poor prognosis. Although recent series have reported improved outcomes, defining optimal therapies remains controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in the outcome of invasive fusariosis. We retrospectively analysed 233 cases of IF from 11 countries, comparing demographics, clinical findings, treatment and outcome in two periods: 1985-2000 (period 1) and 2001-2011 (period 2). Most patients (92%) had haematological disease. Primary treatment with deoxycholate amphotericin B was more frequent in period 1 (63% vs. 30%, p<0.001), while voriconazole (32% vs. 2%, p<0.001) and combination therapies (18% vs. 1%, p<0.001) were more frequent in period 2. The 90-day probability of survival in periods 1 and 2 was 22% and 43%, respectively (p<0.001). In period 2, the 90-day probability of survival was 60% with voriconazole, 53% with a lipid formulation of amphotericin B, and 28% with deoxycholate amphotericin B (p=0.04). Variables associated with poor prognosis (death 90 days after the diagnosis of fusariosis) by multivariable analysis were: receipt of corticosteroids (hazard ratio [HR] 2.11, 95% CI 1.18 - 3.76, p=0.01), neutropenia at end of therapy (HR 2.70, 95% CI 1.57 - 4.65, p<0.001), and receipt of deoxycholate amphotericin B (HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.06 - 3.16, p=0.03). Treatment practices have changed over the last decade, with an increased use of voriconazole and combination therapies. There has been a 21% increase in survival rate in the last decade.
