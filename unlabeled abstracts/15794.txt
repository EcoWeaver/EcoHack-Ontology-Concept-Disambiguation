Additions to the New Zealand fauna of black fungus gnats (Diptera: Sciaridae), with descriptions of six new species
The sciarid fauna of New Zealand is not well known and only two major studies have dealt with this group. The present study is based on material from the later of the two studies as well as new material. Six species are recognised as new to science and are here described: Bradysia novaeseelandiae sp. nov., Corynoptera aggregata sp. nov., Corynoptera catrinjaschhofae sp. nov., Ctenosciara etorutao sp. nov., Pseudolycoriella frederickedwardsi sp. nov. and Pseudolycoriella tonnoiri sp. nov. Bradysia novaeseelandiae sp. nov. is the first Bradysia species described from New Zealand. The Holarctic species Bradysia pallipes and Corynoptera fatigans are recorded from New Zealand for the first time.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:7E1F0507-8740-41C7-BCB9-84910D8EBC65
