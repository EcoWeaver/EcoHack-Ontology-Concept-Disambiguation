Stone loach in Stockholm, Sweden, and royal fish-ponds in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
The stone loach (Barbatula barbatula) occurs in three main areas in Sweden. In the north, it is found in Lapland in the River Tornea"lven. In the south, it is found in Skadegne. There are also two populations near the cities of Stockholm and Nyko"ping. New data suggest that these two populations originate from fish that were kept in ponds. In the 1740s King Frederick I is said to have released stone loaches from German sources in Lake Ma"laren, but this cannot explain its occurrence in Igelba"cken near Stockholm. There is also reason to believe that it was kept in ponds at the royal castle Ulriksdal in the mid-eighteenth century. The fish was possibly imported from the king's native Germany, to be eaten as a delicacy. However, historical records tell of pond-keeping of stone loach by the Royal court in the Stockholm area during the 1680s
