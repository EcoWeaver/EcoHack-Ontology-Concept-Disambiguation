Environmental DNA detection of redfin perch, Perca fluviatilis
Invasive alien species are one of the leading causes of extinctions worldwide. Preventing their establishment, eradicating or containing their spread relies on low-density detection. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has been shown to have superior detection sensitivity compared to traditional methods, permitting detection at lower densities and with greater confidence. Here, we develop a species-specific assay to detect Perca fluviatilis (redfin perch), an invasive freshwater fish present in Australia. We show that the assay is highly sensitive and highly specific to detect the species in Australian freshwater environments and demonstrate the utility of the assay for detecting the species from environmental water samples. This assay will prove useful for low-density detection of P. fluviatilis to assist in the management of this invader, benefiting the conservation of the native species it threatens.
