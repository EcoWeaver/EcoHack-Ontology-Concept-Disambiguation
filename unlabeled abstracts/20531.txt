First Record of Synalpheus Tumidomanus Africanus (Crosnier & Forest, 1965) (Caridea, Alpheidae) in Italian Waters
Synalpheus tumidomanus africanus (Crosnier & Forest, 1965) was recorded in Italian waters for the first time in September 2006, during a baseline port survey in Milazzo, Sicily, aimed at detecting non-indigenous species in port areas. The distribution range of S. tumidomanus africanus is known to extend throughout the warm-temperate sector of the eastern Atlantic and the western and eastern Mediterranean Sea. Prior to this work, the species had never been recorded from the central basin of the Mediterranean. Although the majority of the individuals sampled were large and well-preserved, we could not assess the presence of a stable and well-acclimated population due to the limited number of samples taken and the relatively short period of time covered by the study. At present, there are no data to ascertain the origin of the Sicilian population, but additional studies on S. tumidomanus africanus in the Mediterranean Sea might shed light on the actual distribution of this species.
