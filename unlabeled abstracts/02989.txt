Exotic mosquitoes in New Zealand: a review of species intercepted, their pathways and ports of entry
A review was carried out to identify the exotic mosquito species intercepted in New Zealand to 2004, together with their origins, pathways and ports of entry into the country. A total of 171 interceptions have been recorded since 1929. There was little or no taxonomic information available for many, but at least 27 exotic species not yet established in New Zealand have been intercepted, including important disease vectors such as Aedes albopictus, Aedes aegypti and Culex annulirostris. Of 152 interception records with a described origin, 100 (66%) have originated from the South Pacific, 42 (28%) from Australia alone, while Japan was the likely source for 22 (15%) interceptions and has become the main source of exotic mosquitoes since the 1990s. Aircraft have clearly been the main vessel for invading mosquitoes with 94 (62%) of 151 cases with a described entrance pathway, but that pattern has changed greatly in the past 15 years, with 51 (82%) of 62 interceptions occurring on ships. Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, has been the main port of entry for invaders (75/93; 81%). The data indicate that it is somewhat fortunate that New Zealand has only four exotic mosquito species established. It is necessary, therefore, to adopt comprehensive exotic species monitoring and border surveillance, with particular emphasis on incoming ships and their cargo, in order to stop further mosquito invasions that could potentially lead to future outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases.
