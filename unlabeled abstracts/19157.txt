Non-indigenous armoured catfish in Vietnam: invasion and systematics
The occurrence of non-indigenous armoured catfish Pterygoplichthys aff. pardalis from the Dinh River basin (Khan Hoa Province, Vietnam) is reported. We provide data indicating that this may be a naturalised population and present information on the fish reproduction, which points to possible batch spawning. Potential threats posed by the armoured catfish to the native habitat are discussed. Morphometric traits do not form discrete clusters, patterns of the body colouration (the main diagnostic character of these species) are very diverse and largely embrace those of different species. We suggest that the systematics of the genus should be revised.
