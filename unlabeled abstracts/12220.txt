Invasive gorse (Ulex europaeus, Fabaceae) changes plant community structure in subtropical forest-grassland mosaics of southern Brazil
Gorse (Ulex europaeus L., Fabaceae) is an invasive species of worldwide concern. However, knowledge of its effects on ecosystem and community structure is still missing from most areas of its invasive range, including species-rich ecosystems such as the forest-grassland mosaics of southern Brazil. We studied the influence of landscape mosaic structure and land use on gorse distribution. At the community scale, we examined the effects of proximate gorse canopies on plant community abundance, diversity, and composition. Vulnerability to gorse invasions was highest in heavily grazed grasslands, where gorse canopy cover often reached 50 %. Gorse did not invade natural forests. However, gorse invaded tree plantations. Gorse cover in relatively undisturbed areas, such as ungrazed natural grasslands, was found to be variable, although the physiognomy and structure of mosaic ecosystems was still affected. Gorse canopies exerted significant effects on community structure and composition. Assemblages in the understory of gorse canopies were comparatively species-poor and more homogeneous than beside gorse canopies. Woody species were more abundant in the understory of gorse canopies than in areas beside gorse canopies, whereas the cover of grasses decreased under gorse canopies. We argue that invasions can differentially affect the components of natural forest-grassland mosaics, which could have long-term consequences. Selecting competitive species for restoring native assemblages can provide successful outcomes in managing risks associated to invasive species like gorse.
