Lonicera henryi Hemsl. - a potential exotic forest weed in Switzerland
Weber E. 2005. Lonicera henryi Hemsl. - a potential exotic forest weed in Switzerland. Bot. Helv. 115: 77-81. Lonicera henryi is an introduced climbing woody perennial that has become naturalized in scattered localities in Switzerland. Growth-related traits of this vine were measured at one forest site near Zurich to assess its invasion potential. Current-year shoots were 47-150 cm long, indicating fast growth. There were 128-366 shoots or stems and 0-96 rooted nodes per m-2 of forest floor, indicating considerable competition for other species. Species richness was significantly lower in plots covered by L. henryi mats compared to adjacent control plots. The results suggest that L. henryi has a considerable ability to cover forest floors with a carpet of intertwining stems, and to climb rapidly on shrubs and trees. Further spread of this vine may impede forest tree establishment and crowd out native species.
