Sexual interactions and nestmate recognition in invasive populations of Polistes dominulus wasps
Many social insect species have mating systems or recognition abilities that minimize the chance of inbreeding. In haplodiploid systems, inbreeding is especially costly due to the production of sterile offspring such as diploid males. Diploid males (and their triploid offspring) have been identified in invasive populations of the paper wasp, Polistes dominulus, but to date have not been reported in its native populations. Due to the degree of genetic diversity in the invasive populations, it is unlikely that the production of these genetic 'misfits' is the result of a genetic bottleneck alone, but rather that errors in nestmate recognition may play a role. Here, we investigated sexual interactions and nestmate recognition in male and female P. dominulus. We observed nine types of behavioral interactions (55h of behavioral observation consisting of 1,514 interactions) from triads of paper wasps composed of one gyne (female) and two males--one nestmate male and one non-nestmate male. The frequency of male- or female-initiated aggressive behavior did not differ between nestmates or non-nestmates. Non-nestmates were more likely to attempt to copulate with the gyne, but successful copulations were very rare and occurred between non-nestmates and nestmates. We discuss these results within the context of invasion biology. KeywordsSexual selection-Competition-Hymenoptera-Paper wasps-Diploid males
