Changes in Lake Erie benthos over the last 50years: Historical perspectives, current status, and main drivers
During the last 50 years the ecosystem of Lake Erie has experienced major environmental changes, from anthropogenic eutrophication in 1930-1960s, to nutrient and pollution abatement in the 1970s, and then the introduction of exotic dreissenids in the 1980s. We used multivariate statistical techniques to examine long-term changes in the zoobenthic community, comparing contemporary collections (2009, 2011-2012) and historical data (1963-1965, 1978-1979, 1993, and 1998). The Lake Erie benthic community underwent significant changes during each decade examined, showing signs of recovery following ecosystem restoration in the 1970s, but then experiencing major structural and functional changes after dreissenid (Dreissena polymorpha and D. r. bugensis) introductions. There was a significant temporal trend in community composition changes from 1963 to 2012, and the largest difference was found between pre- and post-dreissenid invasion communities. Currently the lake-wide benthic community is dominated by dreissenids both in density (41%) and total wet biomass (97%), followed by oligochaetes and chironomids. The largest benthic density was found in the central basin, and the greatest biomass in the eastern basin. The number of exotic species found in benthic surveys increased every decade, from 1 in 1963 to 10 in 2009-2012, and the majority of the invaders were molluscs. Whereas the role of benthic invaders in community diversity is still low, their impact has had enormous consequences for the whole ecosystem.
