First record of the invasive Ponto-Caspian mysid Limnomysis benedeni Czerniavsky, 1882 from the River Pripyat, Belarus
The invasive Ponto-Caspian mysid Limnomysis benedeni Czerniavsky, 1882 has been recorded for the first time in August 2007 at three sites on the River Pripyat (the Belarusian part of the inland European central invasion corridor). This species occurs in the onshore shallow zone (depth 0.2-0.3 m) with aquatic vegetation and high temperature. High abundances of this species have been observed in port bays. Most likely, this invasive mysid entered the River Pripyat basin from the Dnieper Reservoirs where it was intentionally introduced after 1960.
