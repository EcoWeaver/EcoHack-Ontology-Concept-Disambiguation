Austropotamobius pallipes reduction vs. Procambarus clarkii spreading: Management implications
One of the main threats to native European crayfish is the spread of alien crayfish species that are immune carriers of the detrimental crayfish plague Aphanomyces astaci. In this study we analyzed both at a regional and at a local scale factors determining native and alien crayfish distribution in an area where the species Procambarus clarkii is currently spreading. We aim to understand which management strategies could prevent the extinction of native populations. We sampled 81 waterbodies in Lombardy (NW Italy) to assess the Austropotamobius pallipes complex and alien crayfish occurrence; we also monitored the only first order stream in our study area that we found to be currently inhabited by A. pallipes upstream and by P. clarkii downstream. A. pallipes generally occurred in small brooks, near the spring, and was linked to low periphyton abundance, while P. clarkii occurred in sites at lower altitudes, far from the spring area, mainly in lentic waterbodies with large widths; this allochthonous species was positively related to periphyton abundance. Our monitoring showed that physical barriers such as dams may prevent P. clarkii dispersal upstream. Our results confirm that A. pallipes and P. clarkii have different ecological requirements and show that, at least during the first years of invasion, P. clarkii spreading involves lowland or downstream altered sites. We suggest the need for management strategies maximizing connectivity among native populations, to avoid isolation, and promoting the separation of native populations from those of P. clarkii.
