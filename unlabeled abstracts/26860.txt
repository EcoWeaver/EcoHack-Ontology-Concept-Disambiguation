WHY SHORT-TERM EXPERIMENTS MAY NOT ALLOW LONG-TERM PREDICTIONS ABOUT INTRAGUILD PREDATION
Equilibrium models are increasingly employed in applied ecology, but often because of experimental logistics, only short-term laboratory experiments are performed. Here, we use simple models to examine the management relevance of this disconnection between theory and experiments in communities with intraguild predation (IGP). Equilib-rium theory shows that IGP can promote coexistence of competitors on a shared resource. However, adding the intraguild predator can result in higher resource densities than in a system with the intraguild prey alone with its resource. This has important management implications when the shared resource is a pest species whose population is controlled by natural enemies. Our models demonstrate why short-term experiments and studies ignoring alternate resources may bear no relationship to a system at equilibrium. Short-term exper-iments quantifying only attack rates can predict a broad range of outcomes. By ignoring conversion efficiency, consumer longevity, and immigration, short-term studies may, for example, cause erroneous decisions about the introduction of natural enemies in biological control. Thus, attack rates, conversion efficiencies, and immigration rates must all be quan-tified for a thorough, long-term understanding of IGP in field systems.
