Suppression of Invasive Fish in the West: Synthesis and Suggestions for Improvement
Reservoirs are ubiquitous features on the landscape of the western United States. Although reservoirs provide numerous benefits (e.g., irrigation, flood control, hydropower, recreational use), these systems are often a concern from an ecological perspective. Reservoirs support fisheries primarily composed of nonindigenous sport fishes that may become invasive and negatively influence recipient ecosystems. Furthermore, reservoirs alter adjacent riverine habitats, further increasing the threat of invasive fishes to aquatic systems. As such, most western natural resource management agencies focus considerable effort on managing the threat of invasive fish species. Unfortunately, controlling invasive fish is expensive and rarely effective because of a lack of clear objectives, appropriate fishing mortality, and long-term commitment. In an effort to improve management of invasive fish in the western United States, we reviewed existing literature to identify the steps necessary to effectively suppress these species. Specifically, we provide guidance on defining achievable objectives, assessing feasibility, evaluating success, and improving the efficiency of invasive fish suppression. This iterative approach provides managers with a framework to effectively address the challenge of suppressing invasive fish in the western United States.
