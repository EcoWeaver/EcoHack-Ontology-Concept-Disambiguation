Mitigating the threat of invasive marine species to Fiordland: New Zealand's first pathway management plan
Multiple human-mediated pathways in the marine environment provide ample opportunities for new and potentially harmful species to spread into high-value natural areas. Often, these areas are remote and reactive measures to an invasion prove to be difficult, therefore a more precautionary and proactive approach is necessary. The Fiordland Marine Area (FMA) is largely unmodified and has a unique and productive underwater environment. Following an amendment in 2012 to the Biosecurity Act 1993 the Fiordland Marine Guardians and an inter-agency government group worked to develop and implement the Fiordland Marine Regional Pathway Management Plan (FMPP), whose overarching objective is to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive marine species to the FMA. The plan involves three key elements to manage invasive species vectors: (1) that vessel owners and operators hold a current Clean Vessel Pass for their vessel; (2) that the vessel meets clean vessel standards including hull biofouling, gear biofouling and residual seawater requirements; and (3) that owners and operators maintain and can present records on the steps taken to meet the clean vessel standards. The plan was made operative in 2017, and to date, uptake has generally been positive with only a small number of compliance issues. The adoption of this plan is largely due to an integrated iwi, community and agency management approach which has encouraged engagement and participation from the Fiordland stakeholders. The ongoing success of this programme will rely on the commitment from the partnering central and local government agencies to improve and refine the plan, and on a general elevation in the importance of marine biosecurity management nationwide. Ideally, the plan will significantly reduce the risk of further marine bioinvasions within the FMA.
