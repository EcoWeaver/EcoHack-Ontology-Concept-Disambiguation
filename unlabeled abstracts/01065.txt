Effects of deer on the photosynthetic performance of invasive and native forest herbs
Overabundant generalist herbivores can facilitate non-native plant invasions, presumably through direct and indirect modifications to the environment that affect plant performance. However, ecophysiological mechanisms behind ungulate-mediated plant invasions have not been well studied. At a long-term Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) exclusion site in a temperate deciduous forest, we quantified deer-mediated ecophysiological impacts on an invasive biennial Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and two palatable native herbaceous perennials, Maianthemum racemosum and Trillium grandiflorum. In mid-summer, we found that leaf-level light availability was higher in unfenced areas compared to areas fenced to exclude deer. Alliaria in unfenced areas exhibited 50% higher mean maximum photosynthetic rates compared to fenced areas. Further, specific leaf area decreased by 48% on average in unfenced areas, suggesting leaf structural responses to higher light levels. Similarly, Maianthemum had 42% higher mean photosynthetic rates and 33% decreased mean specific leaf area in unfenced areas, but these functional advantages were likely countered by high rates of deer herbivory. In contrast, Trillium exhibited significantly lower (26%) maximum photosynthetic rates in unfenced areas, but SLA did not differ. Deer-mediated differences in light saturated photosynthetic rates for all three species were only significant during months with overstory tree canopy cover, when light availability in the herb layer was significantly lower in fenced areas. Alliaria's enhanced photosynthetic rates implicate overabundant deer, a situation that is nearly ubiquitous across its invaded range. Collectively, our results provide empirical evidence that generalist herbivores can alter non-native plant physiology to facilitate invasion.
