Invasive species triggers a massive loss of ecosystem services through a trophic cascade
Significance Invasive species represent a largely unquantified threat to ecosystem services. Although investment in the prevention of species invasions may sustain ecosystem services, these effects of invasions are rarely measured in monetary terms useful to decision makers. We quantify the economic damages of the degradation of an important ecosystem service, water clarity, caused by invasion by the spiny water flea. We find that the costs of restoring this service, US$86.5 million-US$163 million, are comparable with the willingness to pay for the service itself: US$140 million. This finding highlights the severity of invasive species' impacts when their damages to ecosystem services are considered. Costs of invasive species' secondary spread aggregated across many invasive species and ecosystem services may be large.
