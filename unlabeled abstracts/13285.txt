Components, processes and consequences of biotic homogenization: A review
Among the major changes induced by human beings, biotic homogenization is gaining popularity at regional as well as global level. Biotic homogenization is a multifaceted process which results from species extinction, introduction and environmental modification often induced by human beings. This human mediated introduction of alien species and the extirpation of native species, either independently or in combine have caused loss of taxonomic regional distinctiveness among formerly disparate faunas and floras. Ample evidence reveals that extent of homogenization differed between various ecosystems and taxa, as well as in different regions. Although biotic homogenization leads to increase in species richness at local level but causes loss of diversity at global level (i.e., paradox of gaining species but loosing diversity). Potentially biotic homogenization could affect any of the many processes in communities that vary in space and time, such as spatial subsidies and food-web dynamics, and thereby have cascading effects elsewhere on the landscape. Biotic homogenization does have relevance to conservation as it has utility in reserve selection and management. Current knowledge pertaining to patterns, mechanisms and implications of biotic homogenization is highly variable across taxonomic groups, but in general is incomplete. This article is an attempt to review literature pertaining to patterns, mechanisms and implications of biotic homogenization.
