Role of Ecological History in Invasive Species Management and Conservation
Human perceptions of nonindigenous species will ulti-mately drive public policy, and given the large role thesespecies play in our conservation strategies, those per-ceptions should be taken seriously. Associated with theexperience of nonindigenous species are perceptions ofplaceandecologicalhistory.LodgeandShrader-Frechette(2003) clear up some recent confusion regarding inva-sive species, and they conclude that "Despite apparentdisagreements among scholars, little real disagreementexists about the occurrence, effects, or public-policy im-plications of nonindigenous species." Nevertheless, theiressayisneitherclearnorcriticalwithregardtononindige-nousspeciesandtheecologicalhistoryofNorthAmerica.This is not a moot point, but central to conservation andrestoration strategies.Lodge and Shrader-Frechette reaffirm that there is nowwidespread evidence implicating invasive species in thewholesale reduction of biodiversity (e.g., Groombridgeet al. 1992; Wilcove et al. 1998; Roemer et al. 2002). Ac-tion against invasive species is justified given the changesthey induce in ecosystem function, their link to biodiver-sity loss, and the high value placed on the uniqueness ofregional biota.
