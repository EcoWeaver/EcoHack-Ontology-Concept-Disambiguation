Morphological differences between native and non-native pumpkinseed in traits associated with locomotion
Adaptive strategies in morphology can significantly influence the successful invasion and establishment of non-native species. Since its introduction, the pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), a sunfish of North American origin, has spread throughout most of Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula. We hypothesized that 12 morphological traits, functionally significant for locomotion, would differ according to geographic origin (native/non-native) and habitat type (fluvial/lacustrine). Using flow-through raceways, we simultaneously reared F1 young-of-the-year pumpkinseed from two native and two non-native populations, produced from adults kept in a common environment. Morphometric measurements were recorded at the beginning and end of the 90-day rearing period. Median-fin size and placement differed significantly between native and non-native populations, whereas paired fin size differed between fluvial and lacustrine populations. Other functionally significant traits, such as body width, also differed between native and non-native populations. Spanish populations were considered to have acquired these adaptive external morphologies through successive generations, following the species' range expansion through the variable environments of the Iberian Peninsula.
