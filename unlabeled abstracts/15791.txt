PREDICTING THE SUITABLE HABITAT OF THE INVASIVE XANTHIUM STRUMARIUM L. IN SOUTHEASTERN ZIMBABWE
Biological invasions have negatively affected virtually all ecosystems on earth. Thus, reducing the spread of such invasive species is important. A few broad strategies are available on how to reduce the spread of invasive species. The aim of this study is to predict the suitable habitat of the invasive species Xanthium strumarium and to identify the factors associated with its spread in order to improve efforts against invasive species. Presence (53 plots) and absence (52 plots) data for building the prediction were collected from Gonarezhou National Park and the adjacent Malipati communal land, Zimbabwe in April 2013. Ten modelling techniques were employed namely; Generalized linear model, General additive model, Classification tree analysis, Surface range envelope, Multivariate adaptive regression splines, Random Forest, Gradient boosting machines, Maximum entropy, Artificial neural networks and an ensemble model. Environmental factors related to the establishment success of Xanthium strumarium were also identified. Results of this study indicate that machine learning based techniques performed better at predicting the occurrence of Xanthium strumarium, although the ensemble prediction outperformed all the individual models. Xanthium strumarium was predicted to occur in areas that receive direct radiation from the sun, thus, aspect was identified as a critical factor in habitat selection for Xanthium strumarium.
