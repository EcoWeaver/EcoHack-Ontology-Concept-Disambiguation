Risk assessment for the native anurans from an alien invasive species, American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus), in South Korea
AbstractThe invasive species are of global concern, and the Invasive American Bullfrog (IAB; Lithobates catesbeianus) is one of the worst invasive amphibian species worldwide. Like other countries, South Korea is also facing challenges from IAB. Although many studies indicated impacts of IAB on native anurans in Korea, the actual risk at the specific level is yet to evaluate. Considering the putative invasiveness of IAB, it is hypothesized that any species with the possibility of physical contact or habitat sharing with them, will have a potential risk. Thus, we estimated and observed their home range, preferred habitats, morphology, behavior, and ecology. Then, comparing with existing knowledge, we assessed risks to the native anurans. We found a home range of 3474.2 +- 5872.5 m2 and identified three types of habitats for IAB. The analyses showed at least 84% of native anurans (frogs and toads) were at moderate to extreme risks, which included all frogs but only 33% of toads. Finally, we recommended immediate actions to conserve the native anurans based on our results. As this study is the first initiative to assess the specific risk level from the invasiveness of L. catesbeianus, it will help the managers to set conservation priorities and strategies.
