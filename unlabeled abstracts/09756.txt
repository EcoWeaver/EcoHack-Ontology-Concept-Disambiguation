Trends in body condition of smallmouth bass and northern pike (1982-2013) following multiple ecological perturbations in the St. Lawrence River
Body condition indices can be used to investigate fish response to biological or environmental change. We used quantile regression to analyze a 32-year weight-length data set (1982-2013) for smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and northern pike (Esox lucius) from the St. Lawrence River to examine changes in condition (weight-at-length) during three ecologically distinct time periods. Condition of both species varied among time periods, with smallmouth bass experiencing greater proportional changes than northern pike. Smallmouth bass weight-at-length was greatest during 2005-2013 and lowest during 1982-1992. Northern pike weight-at-length was greatest during 2005-2013 for quantiles >=0.5, similar between the 1982-1992 and 2005-2013 time periods for lower quantiles, and lowest during 1993-2004. The most likely weight-length model for smallmouth bass included terms for length, presence of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), presence of dreissenid mussels, and an interaction between length and dreissenid mussels (wi = 0.93). The most likely model for northern pike included terms for length, presence of round goby, presence of dreissenid mussels, water temperature, conspecific abundance, and sex (wi = 0.56). Invasive species and environmental change related to invasive species have altered the condition of smallmouth bass and northern pike in the St. Lawrence River.
