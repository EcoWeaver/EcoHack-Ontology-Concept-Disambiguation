Occurrence of potentially invasive species box elder (Acer negundo L.) in the south of the Russian Far East
Results of investigations on the occurrence of the North American plant species, the box elder, in Primorye in greenery and disturbed natural phytocenoses are presented. At present, occurrence of this species varies from low to mass in different localities. On the studied territory, the box elder is absent from forest biocenoses and present in anthropogenic landscapes: wastelands, kitchen gardens, free places on streets, roadsides, highway roadsides, etc. By the degree of naturalization, the box elder is an epekophyte. Considering increasing economic development of the region, mass dispersal of this species is possible. It can become the dominant species on disturbed lands.
