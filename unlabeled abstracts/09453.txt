Biocontrol opportunities to study microevolution in invasive populations.
Invasive populations have been actively used to test eco-logical and evolutionary hypotheses about colonization success in recent years. This is often complicated by the fact that many confounding factors, such as genetics, demographics, and environmental variables, influence the success of colonizing populations (e.g., see [1]). In a recent paper, Rius and Darling [2] reflect on this challenge in the context of the role of admixture in invading popula-tions and conclude that one of the largest gaps in the field is the lack of statistically robust experimentation in invading populations. We argue that biological control systems offer an under-explored opportunity for experimentation with coloniza-tion success of insects and microbes. Factors determining colonization success are equally important in invasion biology and biological control systems. Apart from the fact that these systems share similar processes (Figure 1), both also have large ecological impacts and involve substantial financial investments. However, biological control systems allow for more precise documentation of relevant informa-tion throughout the whole colonization process. They also offer the opportunity to manipulate variables (e.g., genetics and demographics) that is often confounded in invading populations ([3] and papers discussed in the associated journal issue). The colonization history of invasive species is required for defining and testing hypotheses concerning establish-ment successes. Given incomplete historical data, the Letter
