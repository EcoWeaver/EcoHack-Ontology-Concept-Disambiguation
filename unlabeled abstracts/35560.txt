Decline of Native Unionid Bivalves in Lake St. Clair After Infestation by the Zebra Mussel, Dreissena polymorpha
To determine impacts of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, on bivalves in Lake St. Clair, densities of Unionidae in 1990 and 1992 (after D. polymorpha invasion) were compared with densities in 1986 (before D. polymorpha). Declines in density occurred mainly at sites in the southeastern portion of the lake where unionids were highly infested with D. polymorpha. Unionid densities at highly infested sites declined from 2.4/m2 in 1986, to 1.8/m2 in 1990, and to 0/m2 in 1992. Unionid species with light-weight shells that brood larvae over an extended period declined more between 1986 and 1990 than heavy-shelled, short-term brooders. Unionid densities at lightly infested sites located mainly in the northwestern portion of the lake did not decline: mean densities were 1.4/m2 in 1986, 1.6/m2 in 1990, and 1.4/m2 in 1992. While the mean number of D. polymorpha per unionid was <1 at these lightly infested sites in 1990, it increased to 35 by 1992. Given this relatively slow increase in D. polymorpha per unionid in this portion of the lake, continued monitoring of populations should provide a better understanding of the relationship between the extent of infestations and unionid mortality.
