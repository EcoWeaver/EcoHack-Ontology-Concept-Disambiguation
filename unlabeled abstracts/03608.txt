The homogenous genetic structure and inferred unique history of range shifts during the Pleistocene climatic oscillations of Arcterica nana (Maxim.) Makino (Ericaceae).
Previous phylogeographic studies of alpine plants in Japan have inferred that populations in central Honshu persisted during the Pleistocene climatic oscillations and suggested interglacial survival in high mountains. However, Arcterica nana (Maxim.) Makino (Ericaceae) exhibits a homogenous genetic structure throughout Japan and may therefore have a unique phylogeographic history. This inconsistency could have resulted from insufficient resolution of previously analyzed chloroplast DNA sequences. Therefore, we conducted a phylogeographic investigation based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms. Using 176 individuals from 21 populations, the relationships among individuals and populations were determined by principal coordinate analysis and a neighbor-joining tree, respectively. In addition, genetic differentiation was estimated using analysis of molecular variance and spatial autocorrelation analysis. These analyses demonstrate a homogenous structure throughout the entire Japanese range, supporting the previous cpDNA phylogeography. Although this genetic structure is inconsistent with those of other alpine plants, it is difficult to postulate that pre-existing genetic differentiation was swamped exclusively within A. nana. Therefore, this homogenous genetic structure may have been caused by the distinct history of populations of A. nana. Specifically, the southern-ward migration and the subsequent continuous populations enabled gene flow throughout the Japanese archipelago during the last glacial period. Thus, our data suggest that alpine plants in the Japanese archipelago did not always experience a shared distribution change following climatic oscillations.
