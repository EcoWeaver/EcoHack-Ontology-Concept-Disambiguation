Research for Requiems: the Need for More Collaborative Action in Eradication of Invasive Species
We believe that an explicit collaboration between conservation researchers and conservation practitioners is needed that (1) quantifies and publicizes the efficacy of eradication of invasive species from islands (e.g., Veitch & Clout 2002), (2) critically evaluates existing tools for invasive-species eradication (e.g., Nogales et al., 2004), (3) develops new eradication tools (e.g., Courchamp & Cornell 2000), and (4) exploits eradication programs as large-scale ecological experiments (e.g., Donlan et al. 2002).
