Invasion of Argentine ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in South Australia: Impacts on community composition and abundance of invertebrates in urban parklands
Abstract The Argentine ant (Linepithema humile Mayr) is a worldwide invasive pest species that has been associated with losses of native ant and non-ant invertebrates in its introduced range. To date, few studies have investigated the effects of Argentine ants on native invertebrates in Australia. This study assessed the effects of Argentine ants on community composition of invertebrates, with particular focus on resident ant communities and functional groups. In this study, the author compared the composition and abundances of invertebrates between invaded and uninvaded locations at four paired sites in Adelaide, South Australia. The results showed that there were significantly fewer non-Argentine ants at invaded sites than at uninvaded sites. In particular, ants from the two common and widespread genera Iridomyrmex and Camponotus showed decreased abundances at the invaded sites. Multidimensional scaling analyses revealed differences in the composition of ant communities at the invaded and uninvaded sites, with uninvaded sites characterized by a similar native ant species composition, while communities at the invaded sites displayed much greater variability in species composition. These results suggest that the presence of Argentine ants may have a negative effect on particular ant genera and functional groups, with likely disruptions to ecosystem processes.
