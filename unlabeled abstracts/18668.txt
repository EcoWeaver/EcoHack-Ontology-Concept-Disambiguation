Regional climate-matching to estimate current and future sources of biosecurity threats
Managing the threats posed by invasive alien species currently may involve a mixture of species-specific and pathway-specific policy and operational measures aimed at achieving a socially acceptable level of protection. In order to decide how to allocate scarce biosecurity resources in a manner that avoids erecting technical barriers to trade, it is necessary to undertake risk assessments for individual pests or commodity pathways. Whilst there are popular climatic niche tools available to project future pest risk in terms of a species' potential distribution, the international legal frameworks as yet have no explicit means of including future risk considerations arising from projected climate changes. Nor are there any tested and accepted tools for projecting shifts in geographic pest risk, or systematically identifying future pest risks. I use New Zealand as a case study to demonstrate a method for identifying generic geographic pest risk to a jurisdiction under historical and future climate scenar
