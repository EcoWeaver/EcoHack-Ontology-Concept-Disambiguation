Genetic variability of the invasive cyanobacteria Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii from Bir M'cherga reservoir (Tunisia).
Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is an invasive freshwater cyanobacteria of tropical origin, also found in temperate regions. Due to its known ability to produce potent toxins, such as cylindrospermopsin and the paralytic shellfish poisoning, this species is of major concern from a water quality perspective. This study presents a genetic characterization of four C. raciborskii strains isolated from the Bir M'cherga Tunisian reservoir. The toxicity assessment was investigated via molecular biology tools, which suggested that all the isolated strains were not producing cylindrospermopsin, saxitoxin, or microcystin. This result was further confirmed by HPLC and MALDI-TOF analyses. However, we report for the first time in C. raciborskii the presence of mcyA and mcyE, two segments of the microcystin synthetase mcy cluster. All the strains were identified taxonomically based on the 16S rRNA sequences, and their phylogenetic relationships were assessed using the rpoC1 region. Tunisian strains formed a distinct clade separated from the other African strains.
