Mapping actual distribution of invasive species siam weed and its abundance across biogeographical zones in Benin (West Africa)
Background: Invasive weeds pose a serious threat to agricultural systems worldwide and the management of such species requires information on their distribution. Objective: This research work aimed at assessing the evolution in the distribution of Siaw weed across biogeographical zones in Benin as first step toward the development of management policy and to give insight into the threat it poses to agriculture and biodiversity. Methods: Field and roadside surveys were carried out to record the presence of the species. Geographical coordinates were collected and incorporated in GIS software to map the distribution of the plant. Abundance data were submitted to analysis of variance to compare infestation level across biogeographical zones, and correlation of the species distribution with environmental factors was examined. Results: The extent of occurrence of the species has increased and fell within latitudes 6deg30' and just beyond 10deg North and range from about 0 m to 438 m in elevation, covering the entire area from south to center, and in part the north of the country. This weed is significantly more abundant in sudano-guinean zone (7.28 +- 0.18) than guinean zone (4.72 +- 0.20) and sudanian zone (3.5 +- 0.5). The species distribution is significantly correlated to the major climate variables and soil pH. Conclusion: The distribution of Siam weed mapped here shows progress in its occurrence points. Further studies are needed to better investigate the importance of soil and climate variables in its distribution and the vulnerability of the center zone ecosystems.
