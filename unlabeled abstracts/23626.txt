Influence of coastal plain yellowtops (Flaveria bidentis) residues on growth of cotton seedlings and soil fertility
Flaveria bidentis (L.) Kuntze is an alien species that is highly invasive in Hebei Province. An assessment of the influence of F. bidentis leaf residues on the growth of cotton (Gossypium herbaceum L.) seedlings and on soil fertility was carried out under controlled environmental conditions. Also, the concentrations of phenolics were determined in both F. bidentis residues and residue-amended soil. The results showed that the residues could significantly reduce height, root length and weight of cotton seedlings. The inhibitory effects increased gradually with increases in residue concentration. Peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, as well as the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA), also increased. POD and SOD activity were not significantly increased by 10 g kg of residues, but the differences were significant at 20 g kg of residues. Available K increased with increasing concentration of residues, whereas available P decreased, but the concentration of hydrolyzed N did not change in the soil. The concentration of phenolics also increased with increases in the residue concentration. It is concluded that F. bidentis residues adversely affect the early growth of cotton and have an impact on soil fertility by releasing water-soluble allelochemicals into the soil.
