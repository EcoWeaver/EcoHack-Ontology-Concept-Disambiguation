The effect of high-pressure spraying for tunicate control on byssal thread characteristics in the cultured blue mussel (Mytilus edulis Linnaeus, 1758)
Editor's note: This paper is a contribution to the proceedings of the 3rd International Invasive Sea Squirt Conference held in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA, on 26-28 April 2010. The conference provided a venue for the exchange of information on the biogeography, ecology, genetics, impacts, risk assessment and management of invasive tunicates worldwide. Abstract Mussel growers in Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada, currently use high-pressure water spraying (~700 psi) to mortally injure or dislodge invasive tunicates from mussel product and gear. An added benefit of this process may be the stimulation of byssal thread production, leading to improved mussel attachment. This study measured byssal thread abundance and thickness in cultured blue mussel Mytilus edulis exposed to high-pressure spraying either once, five times (every three weeks), or not at all (control). No significant differences were observed in number or width of byssal threads between treatments indicating routine high-pressure spraying does not affect mussel attachment strength.
