The occurence of an invasive alien mussel Mytilopsis adamsi Morrison, 1946 (Bivalvia: Dreissenidae) in estuaries and lagoons of the lower south of the Gulf of Thailand with comments on their establishment
The invasive false mussel, Mytilopsis adamsi Morrison, 1946 (Bivalvia: Dreissenidae), is a brackish water bivalve, native to tropical West Pacific coast of central America. The species has now become established in East Asian, South Asian and Southeast Asian countries. Species spread has been especially rapid with its distribution now including the lower part of the Gulf of Thailand. This is the first report of the establishment of this species in the lower part of the Gulf of Thailand, in Haad-kaew Lagoon and Thale Sap Songkhla, in Songkhla province, and the Pak Phanang Estuary in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, south Thailand. Descriptions of its morphology are consistent with previous descriptions from other areas as M. adamsi. Based on the available evidence, it is postulated that the species was transported to the areas between the year 1990 and 2000 via international commercial cargo ships. These findings indicate that the spread of M. adamsi is still in progress and that this invasive mussel continues to colonize the Songkhla Lagoon System.
