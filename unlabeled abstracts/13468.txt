The genetic consequences of the anthropogenic movement of social bees
Invasive species often play a significant role in ecosystem decline and the loss of biodiversity. Nonetheless, a number of social bee species (Apidae) have been, and are still being, transported outside their native ranges for use as pollinators and honey producers. Many authors have emphasized the ecological consequences of introduced social bees. Less appreciated is that hybridization between local and introduced bees can lead to genomic extinction of indigenous bee taxa and to a loss in overall biodiversity. More directly, mating interference between introduced and native bees may result in reduced reproductive success of the indigenous taxa. It is therefore important that the benefits of introducing exotic bee species be carefully weighed against the possible costs to indigenous populations.
