Microsatellite markers for study of the invasive species Rumex alpinus (Polygonaceae).
Premise of the study: Polymorphic microsatellite markers were developed to study genetic diversity, population structure, and dispersal strategies of the highly invasive species Rumex alpinus (Polygonaceae). Methods and results: Fifteen polymorphic microsatellite loci were developed using a 454 sequencing approach and used to genotype 72 individuals from six populations in Austria and France. All markers were polymorphic in at least one investigated population, and the number of alleles ranged from one to four alleles per locus. Observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.06 to 1.0 and from 0.18 to 0.72, respectively. Conclusions: These 15 markers will be useful for characterizing dispersal strategies and gene flow assessment between R. alpinus populations and other, often weedy Rumex species.
