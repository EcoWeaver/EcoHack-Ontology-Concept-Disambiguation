Valorization of an invasive woody species,Acacia dealbata, by means of Ionic liquid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis
BACKGROUND The availability of efficient pretreatments is a priority for the development of lignocellulose biorefineries. In this context, the utilization of widespread invasive raw materials and green solvents shows potential advantages. This study provides an experimental assessment on the pretreatment of Acacia dealbata with the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EMIMAc). RESULTSUnder the selected operational conditions (150 degC for 30 min), EMIMAc pretreatment led to favorable percentages of cellulose and xylan recoveries (88% and 66%, respectively), and resulted in about a 13-fold increase in cellulose conversion and a 20-fold increase in xylan with respect to the untreated raw material. CONCLUSION The valorization of Acacia dealbata by EMIMAc pretreatments followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the resulting solids led to high fermentable glucose yields suitable as carbon sources for the biotechnological production of chemicals and biofuels.
