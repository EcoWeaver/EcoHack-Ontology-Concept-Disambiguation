Invasive frogs in Sao Paulo display a substantial invasion lag
The first report of the invasion of the Robber frog Eleutherodactylus johnstonei Barbour, 1914 in the municipality of Sao Paulo was made in 2014. However, we report here that sound records of this species in the same area of Sao Paulo, and deposited in a Brazilian sound archive, date back to 1995. Therefore, we expand the timeframe of the presence of this invasive population in the city, and provide information on its pathway of introduction, which is not accidental as previously suggested, but intentional. These data improve the knowledge on this invasion and indicate the urgent actions to avoid the expansion of this invasive species to other sites where its impact could be higher.
