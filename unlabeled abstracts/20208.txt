A systematic approach for prioritizing multiple management actions for invasive species
The successful management and eradication of invasive species is often constrained by insufficient or inconsistent funding. Consequently, managers are usually forced to select a subset of infested areas to manage. Further, managers may be unaware of the most effective methods for identifying priority areas and so are unable to maximize the effectiveness of their limited resources. To address these issues, we present a spatially explicit decision method that can be used to identify actions to manage invasive species while minimizing costs and the likelihood of reinvasion. We apply the method to a real-world management scenario, aimed at managing an invasive aquatic macrophyte, olive hymenachne (Hymenachne amplexicaulis), which is one of the most threatening invasives in tropical Australia, affecting water quality, freshwater biodiversity, and fisheries.
