Background: The type and distribution of IAS in eastern part of Ethiopia become a very serious issue and infested with in a very high speed. The main aim of this assessment is in order to assess the type, current infestation rate, and to estimate the general abundance of IAS in the eastern part of Ethiopia and used to take or plan appropriate measurement methods as well as in the long run it is important for policy makers to take over an immediate action. Methods: Data collection was performed though interview, filed survey, group discussion, and from different formerly published prepares. Result: From this data we can understand that the infestation stage of IAS, its impact, majorly dominate spices and future projection of those IAS is clearly identified.
