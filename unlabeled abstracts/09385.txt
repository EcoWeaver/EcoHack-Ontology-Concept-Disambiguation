Integrating ecology and genetics to address Acari invasions.
Because of their small size and tolerance to many of the control procedures used for a wide variety of commodities, Acari species have become one of the fastest, unwanted pest travelers since the beginning of this century. This special issue includes eleven studies on adventive and invasive Acari species affecting major crops and livestock around the world. The nucleus for this special issue is formed by the presentations in the symposium on invasive mites and ticks organized at the International Congress of Acarology in Recife, Brazil (ICA-13), in the summer of 2010. This special issue illustrates the increased concerns about domestic and international invasive mites and ticks worldwide.
