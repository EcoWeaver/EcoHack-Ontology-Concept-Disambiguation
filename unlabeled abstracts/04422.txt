Intensifying postfire weather and biological invasion drive species loss in a Mediterranean-type biodiversity hotspot
Significance Changing interactions between climate and fire are impacting biodiversity. We examined the longest vegetation survey record in the Fynbos, South Africa, a fire-prone Mediterranean-type ecosystem and Global Biodiversity Hotspot, finding significant impacts of prolonged hot and dry postfire weather and invasive plants on species diversity. Graminoids, herbs, and species that sprout after fire declined in diversity, whereas the climatic niches of species unique to each survey showed a 0.5 degC increase in maximum temperature. The consequences of these changes for the structure and function of this ecosystem are largely unknown. This interaction between fire and changing climate is cause for concern in fire-prone ecosystems subject to severe summer droughts and temperature extremes, such as southern Australia, California, and South Africa.
