Isolation and characterization of 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci from Neosalanx taihuensis, a rapidly invasive and adaptative species
Neosalanx taihuensis can very rapidly adapt to new environmental conditions and quickly becomes the dominant species when introduced to lakes and reservoirs. To better understand the genetic mechanism responsible for this remarkable ability to invade and adapt to diverse ecosystems, 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated from the genomic DNA of N. taihuensis. These microsatellite loci were identified from 24 individuals from an invasive population sampled in Fuxian Lake, Yunnan Plateau, Southwest China. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 14. Observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.0417 to 0.8636 and from 0.3112 to 0.9202, respectively. The polymorphism information content (PIC) varied from 0.2583 to 0.8928. These microsatellite loci will be essential in performing molecular analyses of genetic diversity and genetic structure in the future. This will ultimately facilitate better understanding of the genetic mechanisms that allow N. taihuensis to successfully invade and adapt to new ecosystems.
