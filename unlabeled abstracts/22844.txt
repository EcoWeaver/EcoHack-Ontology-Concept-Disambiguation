On the origin of Echinodorus grandiflorus (Alismataceae) in Florida ("E. floridanus"), and its estimated potential as an invasive species
A large semi-aquatic plant, Echinodorus floridanus, was described and considered as a rare Floridian endemic only 10years ago. Recent phylogenetic studies revealed that the new species actually belongs into a South American species, E. grandiflorus. This species has been cultivated in Florida as an ornamental aquarium plant at least since the 1980s. This only known wild population in Florida most likely originated by escaping from cultivation, or it was intentionally planted. A maximum entropy niche model suggests a potential range expansion in the southern USA, although the suitability of this area is predicted to be relatively low for the species. Apparently low risk of invasion is also demonstrated by the non-invasive history of this only known wild population. The species may, however, threaten the local flora via hybridization with native Echinodorus species, and hence eradication of the species should be considered.
