Distribution pattern of white snakeroot as an invasive alien plant and restoration strategy to inhibit its expansion in Seoripool park, Seoul
White snakeroot (Ageratina altissima (L.) R. King & H. Robinson) as an invasive alien plant appeared more abundantly at lower elevations where frequent artificial interferences prevailed than at higher elevations where such impacts were less. They appeared abundantly in introduced forests such as black locust plantation but they did not appear or were rare in natural forests such as oak forest. But an exceptional phenomenon where white snakeroot did not appear was found in a Korean pine stand with dense cover afforested recently. Appearance status of white snakeroot in each section of trampling path depended on breadth of the path and relative light intensity. Growth of white snakeroot measured as the number of ramet per genet, height, and biomass was better near the trampling path and was reduced toward the forest interior. The growth was proportionate to the relative light intensity measured according to distance from the trampling path. Such results support the fact generally known in relation to invasion and expansion of the invasive alien plants. From this viewpoint, we suggest a management plan that applies ecological restoration principles to address ecosystems infected with white snakeroot by restoring the integral feature of the degraded nature and more thoroughly conserving the remaining nature.
