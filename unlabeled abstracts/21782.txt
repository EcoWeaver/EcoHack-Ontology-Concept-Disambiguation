Isolation and characterization of polymorphic microsatellite loci from the invasive plant Lantana camara L
Lantana camara is a highly invasive plant that has established itself in at least 60 different countries across the world. Here, we report development of ten microsatellite markers for this species. These microsatellite loci have 2-15 alleles per locus; with observed and expected heterozygosity of 0.022-0.833 and 0.336-0.848, respectively. These markers will be useful in addressing a variety of questions about Lantana camara, including those concerning breeding system, pollination and dispersal, genetic variation and population structure.
