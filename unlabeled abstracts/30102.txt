Ecosystem Impacts of Exotic Plants Can Feed Back to Increase Invasion in Western US Rangelands
Invasive plants in western US rangelands not only greatly decrease native diversity and cover, but also compromise many ecosystem services, resulting in millions of dollars lost each year due to diminished productivity, water quantity, water quality, erosion control, and other key services. These invader-induced changes to the ecosystem can also benefit the invasive species at the expense of natives, making invasive plant control even more intractable. In cases in which invasive species cause positive feedbacks, simply eradicating invaders will only lead to reinvasion. Thus, management needs to go beyond basic invader control by reversing the changes invaders make to ecosystem properties, with a particular emphasis on soils. There is considerable variation in effects of invasive species across sites and time and our understanding of feedbacks and their management is still developing. Yet there are some underexploited tools that show promise in disrupting plant-soil feedbacks and collaborations between managers and researchers can accelerate our understanding and control of these feedbacks.
