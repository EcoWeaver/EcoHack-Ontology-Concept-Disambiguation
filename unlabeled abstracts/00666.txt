Ecology of cryptic invasions: latitudinal segregation among Watersipora (Bryozoa) species
AbstractWatersipora is an invasive genus of bryozoans, easily dispersed by fouled vessels. We examined Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I haplotypes from introduced populations on the US Pacific coastline to investigate geographic segregation of species and/or haplotypes. In California, the W. subtorquata group fell into three major sub-groups: W. subtorquata clades A and B and W. "new sp.". W. subtorquata clades A and B were common in southern California south of Point Conception, a recognized biogeographic boundary, whereas further north, W. subtorquata clade A and W. n. sp. were frequent. The southern California region also had colonies of a morphologically distinct species, W. arcuata, also found in southern Australia and Hawaii; COI variation indicates a common ancestral source(s) in these introductions. The distribution of Watersipora-complex lineages on different coastlines is shown to be temperature correlated. Accordingly, pre-exisitng temperature-based adaptations may play a key role in determining invasion patterns.
