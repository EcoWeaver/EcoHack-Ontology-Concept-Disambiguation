Reply to Proenca et al.: Sown biodiverse pastures are not a universal solution to invasion risk.
Proenca et al. (1) highlight that sown biodiverse pastures (SBP) can provide local solutions that increase production while limiting the risk of new pasture taxa invading natural areas. We agree that in Portugal SBP is an innovative approach for reducing the weed risk. However, SBP does not offer a universal solution to the problems we identify in our assessment of the risks of new pasture taxa (2). We see three issues that limit the potential of SBP as a global solution to invasion risk from pastures.
