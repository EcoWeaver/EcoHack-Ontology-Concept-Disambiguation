The reproductive biology of the invasive ferns Lygodium microphyllum and L. japonicum (Schizaeaceae): implications for invasive potential
The effect of culture system and population source on sexual expression and sporophyte production was examined for two invasive fern species in Florida, USA, Lygodium microphyllum and L. japonicum (Schizaeaceae). Both species are currently spreading through Florida. Long-distance dispersal of ferns is thought to rely on successful intragametophytic selfing. Given the rate of spread observed in both Lygodium species, we hypothesized that both species are capable of intragametophytic selfing. To test this hypothesis, gametophytes of both species were grown in vitro as isolates, pairs, and groups. Both species were capable of intragametophytic selfing; 78% of L. microphyllum isolates produced sporophytes and over 90% of the L. japonicum isolates produced sporophytes. Lygodium microphyllum also displayed the ability to reproduce via intergametophytic crossing, facilitated by an antheridiogen pheromone. Sporophyte production was rapid across mating systems for both species, an advantage in Florida's wet and dry seasonal cycles. The high intragametophytic selfing rate achieved by both species has likely facilitated their ability to colonize and spread through Florida. The mixed mating system observed in L. microphyllum appears to give this species the ability to invade distant habitats and then adapt to local conditions.
