Molecular identification of the invasive strain of Spodoptera frugiperda (JE smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Swaziland
The Fall Armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) has emerged as a new cereal pest in Africa. In 2016, infestations have broken out suddenly in West Africa and spread rapidly to include many countries in central, eastern and southern Africa. This species has two morphologically similar strains and the strain that invaded southern Africa is not known. To determine the armyworm strain composition in the maize, a survey covering all regions of Swaziland was conducted during February to March 2017. Using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene sequencing, the fall army worm strain in Swaziland was identified as the rice strain. This is the first DNA-based characterization of S. frugiperda in southern Africa and a report of the rice strain from Swaziland. The dataset generated are valuable additions to the currently available fall armyworm taxonomy resources. The findings will help in rapid detection of fall armyworm invasion and decision making while considering chemical control, host plant resistant and biological control programs in the country and the rest of the continent.
