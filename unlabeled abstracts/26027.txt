Invasion ecology of quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis): a review of evolutionary and phylogenetic impacts
Two invasive freshwater mussels, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (quagga mussel) and D.polymorpha (zebra mussel), reveal differences in patterns and timing of their invasions in Europe. They belong to different clades in Dreissena phylogenetics: D.rostriformis bugensis genetically is coupled with the brackish water, lacustrine D.r.distincta and the two are believed to represent a single species. As such, the guaqqa mussel has environmental requirements that differ from the congeneric D.polymorpha. D.rostriformis bugensis invasions were confined to reservoirs of the Dnieper, Don and Dniester Rivers of the Black Sea basin. We recorded D.r.bugensis outside the Black Sea basin for the first time between 1992 and 2001, along the Volga River reservoir cascade including the Northern Caspian Sea shallows. This represents a 40-year invasion time lag since an invasion corridor through the Volgo-Don Waterway was established in 1952 (a corridor used extensively by many invertebrate species from the Black Sea region). We attribute the postponed invasion of Europe by D.r.bugensis, including peculiarities in establishment and its absence in fossil records, to its phylogenetically close relationship with D.r.distincta and its recent evolutionary origin. The relatively rapid range expansion of D.r.bugensis in eastern Europe during the past several decades was facilitated by human-mediated ecosystem transformation, notably impoundment of large eastern European rivers, that have allowed this species to utilize newly transformed ecosystems.
