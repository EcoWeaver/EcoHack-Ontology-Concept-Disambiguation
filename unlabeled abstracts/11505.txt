Plant Species Lost in an Isolated Conservation Area in Metropolitan Boston from 1894 to 1993
A recensus was undertaken of the Middlesex Fells (West), a 400-ha woodland park in Metropolitan Boston, to determine how species composition changed between 1894 (the time of first census) and 1993. This park is isolated by an 0.5-km-wide barrier of roads and development from the eastern half of the Fells preserve, is at least 5 km from other protected areas, and is strongly affected by human activity. Out of 422 original plant species, 155 species were no longer present in 1993. Sixty-four new species were recorded on the site in 1993, the majority of them exotic species. The proportion of native species in the flora went from 83% in 1894 to 74% in 1993. Overall, the number of native species is declining at a rate of O.36% per year, whereas the exotic species are increasing at a rate of 0.18% per year. Many of the native species lost were attractive and well-known components of the native flora, such as orchids and lobeliads. Many remaining native plant species have been reduced to one or a few small populations. Species of moist woods were disproportionately lost from the Fells. The loss of species has coincided with an increase in human activity, including ground fires, a greater number of trails and roads, thinning of the forest, and trampling of the vegetation, all of which may have contributed to species loss. A policy to stop and reverse this progressive loss of species might include preventing new trails from being developed, closing off some existing trails, excluding people from sensitive areas, and reintroducing some of the lost species.
