Tropical Trametes lactinea is widely distributed in the eastern USA
Trametes lactinea is reported from the USA for the first time. This large and conspicuous polypore, known until now only from tropical regions, was collected in many different localities in eastern USA. ITS region of six collected specimens and four others from public and private herbaria was sequenced and compared with the sequences in the GenBank. Important macro- and micro-characteristics that discriminate between T. lactinea and its similar species T. elegans are pointed out and discussed.
