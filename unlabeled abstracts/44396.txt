The lime leafminer Phyllonorycter issikii in Western Siberia: Some ecological characteristics of the population of the recent invader
The detection of the lime leafminer Phyllonorycter issikii in Novosibirsk in 2008-2009 is reported. Mines of this pest have been found on the small-leaved lime Tilia cordata and the Siberian lime T. sibirica, but not on the Amur lime T. amurensis (common host plant of moth). Leaves of T. cordata carried 2-3 times more mines than T. sibirica. On both host plants, the parasitism of mature larvae and pupae did not exceed 7%. Lack of control by local parasitoids can give the pest an opportunity to increase population density and spread further in Western Siberia.
