New Distributional Records of Three Alien Species of Megachilidae (Hymenoptera) from Connecticut and Nearby States
New distributional records are presented for three non-native megachilid bees--Anthidium manicatum (Linnaeus), Anthidium oblongatum (Illiger), and Megachile sculpturalis Smith. These bees inhabited every county in Connecticut and several others in nearby northeastern states. My records of A. manicatum from Massachusetts and Rhode Island and of A. oblongatum from Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont represent the first published state records. The multiple, largely exotic, floral hosts reported with the distributional records provide more evidence that A. manicatum and A. oblongatum are polylectic. The current distributional range and the potential impact of these adventive species are discussed briefly.
