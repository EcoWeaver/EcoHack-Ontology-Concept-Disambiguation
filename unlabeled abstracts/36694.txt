Invasive species: Fish and fisheries Workshop overview, then and now
This short paper provides an overview of the "Invasive species: fish and fisheries Workshop" held in Wellington, New Zealand, 2003, with a retrospective comparison to a similar workshop held in 1989. The "then and now" comparison provides some insights into progress (or lack of it) on invasive fish issues over that 14-year period. The workshop also highlighted the degree of commonality on this issue between Australia and New Zealand.
