Predation pressure of introduced mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki Girard), on the native zooplankton community. A case-study from representative habitats in the lower Mondego river Valley (Portugal)
Mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, was introduced into the Iberian Peninsula in 192 1, becoming widely distributed in fresh- water systems associated to rural and urban areas. However, the impact of its introduction on natural aquatic communities in such areas has never been properly assessed. In this paper, we evaluate the influence of G holbrooki on the zooplankton com- munity of the river Mondego valley (Central Portugal). Spatial and temporal diet shifts were examined in two representative habitats of central Portugal, a typical rice field and a semi-natural protected wetland. Mosquitofish feed mainly on zooplank- ton (Copepoda, Cladocera, Rotifera and Ostracoda), although surface insects, such as aphids, collembolans, adult (imago) chi- ronomids and other dipterans may constitute aditional food. Although Gambusia's ingestion rates are low, high population den- sities may cause a considerable predation pressure on zooplankton. Garnbusia was found to exert a stronger predation pres- sure on zooplankton in the rice field, where zooplankton presented scarcer populations, than in the semi-natural protected wet- land. Consumption rates of Gambusia changed as a function of body size and reproductive period. Gambusia holbrooki exert- ed significant predation pressure on native zooplankton populations and certainly competed with other coexisting fish species.
