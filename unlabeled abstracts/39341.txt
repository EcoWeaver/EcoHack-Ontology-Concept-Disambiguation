Short- and long-range dispersal of the Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni and its relevance to invasive potential, sterile insect technique and surveillance trapping
Dispersal of immature and sexually mature Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) from releases made at a single point was assessed from recapture rates obtained by using arrays of traps. The recapture data (pertaining to distances up to 480 m) fitted both logarithmic and Cauchy models although the fits for the releases of immature flies were inferior because of high variability in catches at certain distances. When combined with data previously published for longer distances, a Cauchy model fitted data for releases of immature flies well and indicated that the median distance dispersed after emerging from the puparium was ~120 m and that 90% of flies would displace less than 800 m despite the fact that a consistent trend in declining catch rates can be obtained up to at least 85 km. This is consistent with the tail of the Cauchy distribution having a slope congruent with a negative power curve and thus being scale invariant for longer distances. The distribution of recaptured flies that wer
