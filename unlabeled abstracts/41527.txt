Establishment of an invasive grass in closed-canopy deciduous forests across local and regional environmental gradients
Establishment of Microstegium vimineum, an invasive exotic grass, in closed-canopy U.S. eastern forests was evaluated across a local (roadside to forest interior) and regional (across two geographic provinces) environmental gradient in West Virginia. The two geographic provinces were the Allegheny Plateau (more mesic) and the Ridge and Valley Province (more xeric). Biotic, abiotic, and disturbance variables were measured in (1) systematically located plots, starting from the roadside and extending 50m into the forests, and (2) randomly selected, forest interior plots, with equal numbers of plots containing or not containing M. vimineum. Associations between the variables and the presence of M. vimineum at both scales were evaluated using generalized linear models. Relative importance of the variables related to M. vimineum establishment in the forest interior plots at the regional scale was determined using logistic regression. Results confirmed Microstegium vimineum's reduced reproductive capacity in the forest interior compared to the roadside. Patches of M. vimineum in the forest interiors across the regional gradient were best defined by high native plant richness and diversity. Greater canopy opening, more moss, and shallower litter depths were also positively and significantly associated with M. vimineum presence, but only during the driest sample year.
