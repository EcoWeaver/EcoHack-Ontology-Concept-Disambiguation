Knowledge on exotic mosquitoes in Germany, and public acceptance and effectiveness of Bti and two self-prepared insecticides against Aedes japonicus japonicus
AbstractMosquito-borne diseases are a continuous challenge to public health. To prevent transmission, Integrated Vector Management (IVM) applies preventive, control, and communicational strategies that should be feasible, environmentally benign, and sustainable. IVM shows higher efficiency when being supported by local communities. Accordingly, we applied a social-ecological approach to identify the public acceptance of control measures and effectiveness of Eurocent coins containing copper, clove essential oil (EO) and Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti). We performed field and laboratory experiments to demonstrate the toxicity of alternative substances against Aedes japonicus japonicus. In expert interviews, we asked for (1) knowledge on exotic mosquitoes in Germany, (2) potential chances of alternative substances in future mosquito control, and (3) their needs for further clarification before application. We assessed potential users' (4) awareness of exotic mosquitoes and (5) willingness to apply the substances. Self-prepared copper coins and EO were clearly preferred by potential users over Bti. However, 100% mortality of the sensitive first stage could not be reached with the number of ten 5-Eurocent coins showing limited toxicity. Clove EO was shown to work as oviposition deterrent and larvicide with a LC50 of 17 mg l-1 (95% CI: 15-19 mg l-1). This study shows the importance of potential users' perspectives in IVM and the need for authorised insecticides.
