Generalized receptor law governs phototaxis in the phytoplankton Euglena gracilis
Significance Many phytoplankton species sense light and move toward or away from it. Such directed movement, called phototaxis, has major ecological implications because it contributes to the largest biomass migration on Earth, diel vertical migration of organisms responsible for roughly one-half of the global photosynthesis. We experimentally studied phototaxis for the flagellate alga Euglena gracilis by tracking algal populations over time in accurately controlled light fields. Observations coupled with formal model comparison lead us to propose a generalized receptor law governing phototaxis of phytoplankton. Such a model accurately reproduces experimental patterns resulting from accumulation and dispersion dynamics. Direct applications concern phytoplankton migrations and vertical distribution, bioreactor optimization, and the experimental study of biological invasions in heterogeneous environments.
