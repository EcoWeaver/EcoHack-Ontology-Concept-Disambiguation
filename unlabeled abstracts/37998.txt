First Record of Exotic Fish Canthidermis maculata (Bloch, 1786) (Pisces: Balistidae) in the Canary Islands (Central-East Atlantic)
The distribution of the Rough triggerfish, Canthidermis maculata, has been established in the East Atlantic for the west coast of subtropical central Africa, from Cape Verde Islands to Gabon, but with some records also toward Angola. The capture of a single specimen (TL: 289.6 mm) by tuna vessels in the Canary Islands, expand the distribution range of this species northward.
