Ecology. Galapagos takes aim at alien invaders.
ECOLOGYScientists are waging a two-pronged assault on the goats, rats, weeds, and other exotic species that threaten the fabled archipelago's flora and fauna. In one of the most ambitious attempts ever to combat invasive species, biologists and staff of the Charles Darwin Research Station and the GalAipagos National Park Service will use a combination of brute force, high-tech gadgetry, and cutting-edge science to wipe out some alien species, make a dent in other populations, and bolster controls to keep other exotics out. The scientists believe that eradicating the most troublesome species all at once is the only way to stop the destruction of the GalAipagos.
