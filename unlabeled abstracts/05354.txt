Genomes, free radicals and plant cell invasion: recent developments in plant pathogenic fungi
This review describes current advances in our understanding of fungal-plant interactions. The widespread application of whole genome sequencing to a diverse range of fungal species has allowed new insight into the evolution of fungal pathogenesis and the definition of the gene inventories associated with important plant pathogens. This has also led to functional genomic approaches to carry out large-scale gene functional analysis. There has also been significant progress in understanding appressorium-mediated plant infection by fungi and its underlying genetic basis. The nature of biotrophic proliferation of fungal pathogens in host tissue has recently revealed new potential mechanisms for cell-to-cell movement by invading pathogens.
