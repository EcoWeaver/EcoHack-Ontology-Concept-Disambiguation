Nematodes associated with the invasive quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) in the Colorado River Aqueduct reservoirs, southern California, USA
The nematode community inhabiting the mantle cavity of quagga mussels, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, in Copper Basin Reservoir and Lake Skinner was quantified and compared for the first time with the nematode community from the periphyton surrounding the mussels. Nematode species inhabiting the mantle cavity were also found in the periphyton, while the periphyton community always contained more species than the mantle cavity. Chromadorina bioculata was the dominant species in the mantle cavity and periphyton community in Lake Skinner and Copper Basin Reservoir. Our results suggest that nematodes found inside the mantle cavity of the mollusc do not have obligate symbiotic relationship with quagga mussels, but that they are free-living, entering from the periphyton community into the mantle cavity of the mussel, exhibiting neutralism.
