Sphaeralcea bonariensis (Malvaceae): A newly recorded introduced species in the flora of the United Arab Emirate
This article reports the presence of the alien species Sphaeralcea bonariensis (Cav.) Griseb. for the first time in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Voucher specimens are deposited in the Herbarium of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew and in the herbarium of the Sharjah Seed Bank and Herbarium (SSBH) laboratory, UAE. This report emphasizes the importance of monitoring and regular reporting of emerging threats of introduced species, to avoid any possible negative impacts on native biodiversity in the future. The Arabian Gulf flora, including that of the UAE, has yet to be comprehensively investigated, and the chance of introductions of exotic plants is high, due to the large proportion of agricultural materials being imported from other countries.
