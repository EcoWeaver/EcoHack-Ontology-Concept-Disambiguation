Expansion of the Range of the Introduced Toad Bufo marinus in Australia from 1935 to 1974
The marine toad, Bufo marinus, was introduced to Australia from Hawaii in 1935. From the initial introduction site (Gordonvale, Queensland), the species was deliberately introduced to Mossman, Babinda, Ingham, Bamaroo, Giru, Ayr, Mackay, Bundaberg and Isis in the coastal Queensland sugar cane districts by 1937. B. marinus dispersed from these areas with the population undergoing an exponential increase in geographical range during the 40 year period from 1935 to 1974. The mode of dispersal was primarily natural or short distance movements aided by humans. The species is now found in 584,000 km2 or 33.8% of Queensland. The geographical growth rate has been 8.1% per year and expansion continues at all margins of the current range.
