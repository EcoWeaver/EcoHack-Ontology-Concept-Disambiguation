Isolation and characterization of short tandem repeats in an invasive swimbladder nematode, parasitic in Atlantic freshwater eels, Anguillicola crassus
We describe the isolation and characterization of seven polymorphic short tandem repeats (STR) for the eel parasite Anguillicola crassus. This invasive swimbladder nematode endemic in East Asia was recently introduced into Europe. The number of alleles for each STR ranged from 13 to 39 per locus with observed heterozygosities between 0.49 and 0.98. The Taiwanese population displayed higher genetic diversity compared to the Irish sample, an observation consistent with the Asian biogeographical origin of the nematode. Availability of the reported STR will facilitate the investigation of the population genetic structure with regard to multiple invasions.
