Spore Establishment Probability and the Persistence of the Fugitive Invading Moss, Orthodontium Lineare: A Spatial Simulation Model
A simulation model was used to establish how many spores need to give rise to new colonies for a bryophyte species to persist in a system of temporary habitat patches. The model was applied to an invading moss species, Orthodontium lineare, in Skane (southern Sweden), which invades a system of sparse substrate patches (rotting wood). Analysis of sensitivity showed that principal processes influencing the ability to invade and persist are spore transport and establishment; disturbance rate, competition, and colony growth have less importance. Stochastic variation in establishment probability greatly increased the ability of species to invade and persist at lower average establishment probability values. The range of values under which the occupation of patches is limited by dispersal and establishment is generally narrow, which means that systems with this type of limitation are probably rare in the field.
