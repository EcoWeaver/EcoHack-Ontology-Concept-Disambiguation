Self-pollination in island and mainland populations of the introduced hummingbird-pollinated plant, Nicotiana glauca (Solanaceae).
Traits associated with self-pollination are common in island plants. This pattern could simply reflect the vestige of selection during colonization. Alternatively (or in addition), the ability to self-pollinate may provide a reproductive assurance benefit in established island plant populations due to inferior island pollinator service. To test these alternatives I studied an introduced plant (Nicotiana glauca; Solanaceae) on the California mainland and on two Channel Islands colonized at different times (approximately 30 and 100 yr ago). I compared these populations in terms of (1) capacity for self-pollination (self-compatibility, autogamy, stigma-anther distance, and incidence of a crumpled floral morph) and (2) current selection for the ability to self-pollinate (pollinator service by hummingbirds and the effect of emasculation on reproductive success). In general, island plants exhibited a higher capacity for self-pollination than mainland plants, especially on the most recently colonized island. However, island plants were not visited less frequently or more variably, nor did I detect current selection for selfing on islands. This supports the hypothesis that selfing traits in island plants are the product of a filter to successful establishment during colonization and not of selection for selfing in established island populations.
