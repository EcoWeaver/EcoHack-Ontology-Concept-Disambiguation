Assessment of the Influence of the Invasive Species Pistia stratiotes (Araceae) on Some Species of Submerged Macrophytes of Natural Water Bodies of Ukraine
The influence of the invasive species Pistia stratiotes L. on submerged macrophytes was investigated. It has been found that the development of Vallisneria spiralis and Ceratophyllum demersum was inhibited, whereas that of Elodea canadensis was stimulated by P. stratiotes at its plant cover of 50%. As a consequence, the content of photosynthetic pigments in V. spiralis decreased by a factor of 2, whereas that in C. demersum - by a factor of 3. P. stratiotes is capable of inhibiting the development of plant species sensitive to light conditions, oxygen content, and pH.
