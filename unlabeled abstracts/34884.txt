Challenges to IPM Advancement: Pesticides, Biocontrol, Genetic Engineering, and Invasive Species
Integrated pest management (IPM) is widely promoted as the most sensible method of sustainable control of important agricultural pests. However, IPM is not widely practiced in commercial crops where this technology could be utilized. In crops where IPM is used, the sophistication of programmes with respect to the numbers of species, types of pests, and variety of control tactics simultaneously implemented are often simplistic and continued development of existing programmes for greater sophistication and management of multiple pest complexes is extremely challenging thus making progress slow. This situation for IPM may become more difficult to resolve in New Zealand, and elsewhere, as difficult and controversial pest management issues related to pesticide use, importation and utilization of exotic natural enemies, deployment of transgenic crops, invasive species, and a diminishing base of scientific talent and research funding become increasingly apparent and demanding of attention and resolution.
