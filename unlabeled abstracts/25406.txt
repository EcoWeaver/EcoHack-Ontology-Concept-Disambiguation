Furtive foes: algal viruses as potential invaders
AbstractLawrence, J. E. 2008. Furtive foes: algal viruses as potential invaders. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 716-722. Viruses are abundant in the world's oceans, existing through parasitic relationships with their various hosts. Algal viruses infect representatives of all major algal taxa, influencing phytoplankton population dynamics, marine foodweb interactions, and global biogeochemical cycling. Although the transportation, spread, and persistence of specific viruses remain to be explored fully, the potential for algal virus introductions and invasions is clearly evident. An estimated 3 x 1022 viruses are transported globally in ballast water alone, destined for ports where few physiological or physical barriers inhibit their invasive success. This fact, coupled with recent findings that viruses are not homogeneously distributed throughout the world's oceans, suggests that virus invasions pose a potential threat to marine ecosystems.
