New records from Lithuania of fungi alien to Europe
First records from Lithuania of the ascomycete Ophiostoma novo-ulmi and basidiomycetes Clathrus archeri, Leucocoprinus cepistipes, and Stropharia rugosoannulata are presented. All four species are alien to Europe and two, C. archeri and S. rugosoannulata, have never been recorded in the eastern part of the Baltic Sea region before. Also, a reassessment of the status in Lithuania of the alien pathogen Hymenoscyphus fraxineus and its close relative, the non-pathogenic H. albidus indigenous to Europe, indicates that only H. fraxineus occurs in Lithuania. Descriptions of the examined fungi are presented, and remarks on their habitats and distribution are provided.
