What we must do - An exotic invasive species in paradise
The soft coral Chromonephthea brazilensis was first recorded at Arraial do Cabo, on the southeastern Brazilian coast. Following studies showed that the presence of C. braziliensis may be a real threat to regional biodiversity, especially to endemic coral species. This study provides a new record of this exotic invasive species in the region. Taking into account the environmental damage caused by this species, its known distribution and dispersal potential, the study presents recommendations for the eradication and monitoring of C. braziliensis in the region, before its control becomes unfeasible.
