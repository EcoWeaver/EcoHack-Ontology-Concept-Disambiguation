Using realistic nitrogen deposition levels to test the impact of deposition relative to other interacting factors on the germination and establishment of grasses in the California oak savanna
Nitrogen (N) deposition is a spatially and temporally heterogeneous process. Thus, the response to N deposition by plant communities can also be expected to vary in space and time. The total amount of deposition received by a plant community may vary regionally due to proximity to emission sources and locally due to vegetation structure. Temporal variation such as a seasonal peak in N deposition may coincide with specific life stages of the plant and drive community response to N deposition. Using the California oak savanna as a model ecosystem, a greenhouse experiment simulating realistic levels of N deposition received across the region was conducted to test the relative effects of N fertilization, soil type, light, and community mixture on the germination and seedling establishment of grasses. Seedling mixtures were composed of 3 common grass species--Stipa pulchra, Hordeum murinum, and Elymus caput-medusae--grown in monoculture and in 2- and 3-species combinations. Nitrogen fertilization alone had no effect on germination or seedling establishment, with one exception that high N increased seedling establishment of E. caput-medusae when that species was grown in monoculture. This limited effect of N deposition in a complex and realistic experimental setting indicated that deposition levels in oak savannas are not affecting most plants during early growth. Rather, early growth stages are species-specific and respond most strongly to neighbor identity.
