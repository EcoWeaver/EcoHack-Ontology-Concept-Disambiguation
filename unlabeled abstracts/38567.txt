Dynamics of Ludwigia hexapetala Invasion at three Spatial Scales in a Regulated River
Management of riverine ecosystems often requires mitigation of alien plant invasions. Understanding how environmental variation within watersheds influences distribution and spread of invasive plants is essential for restoration of impacted ecological functions. Ludwigia hexapetala, an emergent macrophyte from South America, has aggressively invaded wetlands in many regulated rivers. Its clonal fragments disperse by hydrochory, but factors associated with population expansion are unknown. In a four-year study, we measured the distribution and abundance of L. hexapetala and associated environmental variables at three spatial scales in the Russian River, California. Results suggest individual population patches expanded where available light and aqueous phosphorus were somewhat elevated relative to uninvaded areas. Invaded patches did not expand unabated; greatest expansion occurred in the middle river (up to 37%) and lower river (up to 88%). In contrast, up to 20% contraction of invasive patches occurred locally above seasonal instream impoundments. At reach and watershed region scales, increasing variability in hydrologic variables correlated with patch structure and spatial dynamics of the invasion. L. hexapetala was most abundant in areas with high relative variation in flow. These findings provide the foundation for development of spatially-prioritized integrated hydrologic and invasive plant management strategies that could improve ecological restoration outcomes.
