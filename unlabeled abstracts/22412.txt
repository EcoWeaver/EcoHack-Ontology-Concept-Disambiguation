Isolation and characterization of microsatellite loci from the invasive delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata), with cross-amplification in other Australian Eugongylus group species
The delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata), native to eastern Australia, is one of the most successful invasive reptiles in the Pacific region, with established populations in New Zealand, the Hawaiian Islands, and Lord Howe Island. Here we isolate and characterize 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci for L. delicata. Genetic variation was assessed in individuals from Sydney and also from the eastern Victoria and Tasmanian region. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 23, with high levels of heterozygosity. All microsatellite loci successfully amplified in individuals from the three invasive populations. Cross-amplification of these loci was assessed in 14 species from other Eugongylus group skink genera. These microsatellite markers will be used to investigate the invasion dynamics of L. delicata.
