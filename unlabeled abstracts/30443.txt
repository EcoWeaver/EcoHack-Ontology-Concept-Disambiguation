Alien brown trout invasion of the Italian peninsula: the role of geological, climate and anthropogenic factors
Environmental, climate and historical factors are important to explain patterns of freshwater biodiversity and population dynamics in the Mediterranean area. This region is one of the most important areas for the maintenance of native lineages for brown trout. The aim of this study was the identification of the main drivers for the spread and the distribution of genetic introgression between alien brown trout and two native Mediterranean salmonids (brown and marble trout). Estimates of mitochondrial and nuclear introgression were from both the literature and original data and were used as dependent variables in a multivariate framework, correlating them to a suite of environmental and climate parameters. The last glacial maximum appeared as an important factor explaining the geographic pattern of alien brown trout genes throughout the Alps. Here, native populations of Mediterranean salmonids persisted in former refugia. Throughout the Italian Peninsula and major islands, geological setting of catchment and current climate conditions are key factors for securing the persistence of native trout populations. The reevaluation of genetic data regarding the spread of alien brown trout lineage into Mediterranean salmonids populations with a landscape approach allowed us to reveal the role of important factors implicated with the current pattern of distribution of remnant native populations of salmonids. This information provides new insights for improving conservation strategies and management of taxa threatened by the incipient global climate changes.
