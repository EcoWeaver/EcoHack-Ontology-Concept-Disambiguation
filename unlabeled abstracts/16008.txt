Waterbird-mediated passive dispersal is a viable process for crayfish (Procambarus clarkii)
Human transport and active dispersal of the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) contribute to its rapid spread. However, some small aquatic organisms can be transported by birds. We made two hypotheses related to waterbird-mediated passive dispersal of juvenile crayfish. The first is that, depending on water depth, recently hatched crayfish can attach to ducks, initiating passive external transport (i.e., ectozoochory). The second is that recently hatched crayfish can survive bird flight, being affected by crayfish features, flight distance, and environmental conditions. A first experiment tested the attachment of juvenile crayfish to ducks at different water depths by using a freshly dead duck and tanks with crayfish. Another set of three experiments tested crayfish survival during air transportation. To simulate bird flight, we first used a vehicle moving at bird flight speed, and we then used trained pigeons. Several flight distances, environmental conditions, and crayfish sizes were tested. Our results showed that juvenile crayfish were capable of clinging to duck feathers and were transported when ducks were removed from the water. Furthermore, some juveniles of P. clarkii were able to survive long-distance transport when suspended outside a moving vehicle or when transported by birds. The probability of success was affected by water depth, crayfish size, distance travelled, and relative humidity. Our results support the occurrence of passive transportation of this invader by means of attachment to birds. These findings indicate that waterbird-mediated passive dispersal should be taken into account to explain P. clarkii's rapid spread and should be considered when managing its invasions.
