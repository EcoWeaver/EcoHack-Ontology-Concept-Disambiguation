Population genetics of Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera): comparison of native and introduced populations
Background: Invasive species can interfere in the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Better understanding of the evolution of such species will be useful when planning their management and eradication. Aims: We aimed to compare patterns of genetic variability in Impatiens glandulifera in native and introduced regions. Methods: We used native samples from India and Pakistan, and non-native samples from Canada, Finland and the UK. Genetic analyses included genotyping using 10microsatellite markers and sequencing of the nuclear ITS region. Results: Mean allele numbers from native and introduced samples were even, 8.8 and 8.5, respectively, while expected heterozygosities were higher in native samples (mean 0.738) than in non-native samples (mean 0.477). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium testing indicated significant heterozygote deficiencies at 70% of the loci. Inbreeding coefficients were high in both native and introduced regions (range 0.201-0.726). STRUCTURE analyses showed that native samples from India and Pakistan possessed similar clustering patterns while non-native samples from the UK and Canada resembled each other. One of the four Finnish populations had a similar pattern with the UK and Canadian populations, while the rest showed similarly unique genetic compositions. ITS sequencing indicated in Pakistani samples two polymorphic sites not found in Indian samples but present in some samples from Canada, Finland and the UK. Conclusions: Distinct population genetic patterns indicate that human-mediated dispersal is important in I. glandulifera.
