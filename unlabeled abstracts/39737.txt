First report of the invasion of Q2 subclade of Bemisia tabaci MED in South Korea as revealed by extensive field investigation
The genetic structure analysis of alien species may be associated with the introduction routes and potential mechanism of invasions. There were at least three introduced cryptic species of Bemisia tabaci (MEAM1, MED, and JpL) determined in South Korea. However, the invasion pathway and patterns of the alien B. tabaci in greenhouse in South Korea remain poorly known. In the present study, we analyzed the composition and distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes of B. tabaci MED collected from 7 provincial level administrative units in South Korea in 2018 based on the mtCOI. Our results revealed that three haplotypes (abbreviated as Hap1, Hap2, and Hap3) were present in B. tabaci MED in South Korea based on mtCOI fragment analysis. Among the haplotypes, Hap2 was dominant (98.98%), followed by Hap3 (0.68%) and Hap1 (0.34%). Our result suggests that there were at least three introductions of B. tabaci MED into South Korea, which may come from the eastern Mediterranean and western Mediterranean regions. This is the first report of B. tabaci MED of eastern Mediterranean origin being introduced into South Korea, indicating that the introduction has been recent. The potential mechanisms contributing to the dominance of the Hap2 of B. tabaci MED in South Korea are discussed. The genetic structure analysis will be helpful to reveal the cryptic invasion of alien whitefly in South Korea.
