Alien species of Ponto-Caspian amphipods (Crustacea, Amphipoda) in the Dnieper river basin (Belarus)
The results of the studies on modern distribution, abundance, and structure of the communities of alien Ponto-Caspian amphipods and their specific role in macrozoobenthos in different sites of the Dnieper and Pripyat rivers in the territory of Belarus are presented. The most widespread species in the Dnieper basin are Dikerogammarus vilosus and D. haemobaphes, which are found at all river stations under study. The maximum abundance of the species compared to other amphipods is recorded in river ports. The comparative analysis of the amphipod community demonstrates that D. haemobaphes dominates in both the Dnieper and Pripyat rivers and is the most successful invader. The portion of Ponto-Caspian amphipods in the total abundance of macrozoobenthos at different stations can reach 15-20%.
