New records of the invasive mollusk Melanoides tuberculata (M&uuml;ller, 1774) (Gastropoda, Thiaridae) in the Brazilian Northeast
Melanoides tuberculata (Muller, 1774) was recorded during field surveys of the malacofauna of Territorio Vale do Guaribas in Piaui state, northeastern Brazil. Individuals were observed every month (June 2017-September 2018) in both lotic and lentic habitats. Considering that M. tuberculata has high reproductive and adaptative capacities besides being an intermediate host of digenetic trematodes, this invasive species is expected to be a threat to native biodiversity. Furthermore, it may become a serious environmental problem considering the multiple uses of the water bodies where it lives.
