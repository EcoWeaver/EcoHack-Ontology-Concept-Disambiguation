The role of patch area and habitat diversity in explaining native plant species richness in disturbed suburban forest patches in northern Belgium. BIODIVERSITY RESEARCH
Relatively easy measurable patch overwhelming importance of patch area relative to habitat variables in determining species richness. This characteristics (especially habitat diversity measures) suggests (1) the occurrence of density-dependent species have proven to be valuable indicators of forest plant extinction processes in small forest patches; or (2) the species richness in forest fragments of relatively existence of external deterministic factors which put a undisturbed areas. Urban and suburban forest patches, major constraint on species richness in small patches. however, are characterized by a specific landscape We tend to support the latter hypothesis and propose ecological context implying that specific processes may forest disturbance and associated black cherry (Prunus influence ecosystem functioning and hence that other serotina Ehrh.) invasion as such a possible external abiotic indicators for plant diversity are more factor. Small forest patches may be more sensitive to appropriate. We studied the relation between functional disturbance and biological invasion due to various ecological plant species groups and suburban forest reasons. Hence large forest patches are to be preferred patch characteristics such as patch area, habitat for plant conservation in the suburban area. diversity and isolation. Some components of species richness were related to the isolation of the patches. In Key words.
