Antioxidant response and caulerpenyne production of the alien Caulerpa taxifolia (Vahl) epiphytized by the invasive algae Lophocladia lallemandii (Montagne)
Invasive algae alter the structure and function of ecosystems. The red algae Lophocladia lallemandii grows in the West Mediterranean epiphyting the green algae Caulerpa taxifolia, another invasive alga. Our aim was to determine whether the invasive algae Lophocladia, recently introduced in the West Mediterranean, induces oxidative stress and an antioxidant response in Caulerpa taxifolia. We measured the caulerpenyne production, the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the levels of markers of lipid peroxidation in Caulerpa taxifolia. Caulerpenyne concentration was significantly higher in Caulerpa taxifolia epiphytized by Lophocladia. End-products of lipid peroxidation -malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxinonenal (4-HNE)- were significantly increased in Caulerpa taxifolia samples from the station with Lophocladia. Antioxidant enzyme activities -catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD)-, as well as H2O2 production significantly increased in the Lophocladia station compared to the control station. The activities of catalase and SOD determined in Lophocladia lallemandii showed no significant differences between Lophocladia living alone and Lophocladia epiphytating Caulerpa taxifolia. Caulerpa taxifolia epiphytized by Lophocladia lallemandii responded by increasing the caulerpenyne and H2O2 production and the antioxidant enzymes activities as a defensive mechanism against the new invasive algae.
