Impacts of invasive species on the sustainable use of native exploited species
In recent years, the important challenging issues are biological invasions to biodiversity, overexploitation and extinction of several species. Invasive species often alter the workings of ecosystems around the globe. In the present research, our aim is to study the possible impacts of invasive species on the sustainable use of native exploited species. To address this issue, cleaning operation is introduced to protect biodiversity and recover stocks. It is found that presence of invasive species reduces the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of native species. In case of prey-predator system, prey harvesting at MSY level causes the extinction of predator species, but extinction effort increases with the cleaning effort. It is also observed that when independent efforts are applied on both the prey and predator species, global maximum sustainable total yield (MSTY) exists and it increases as the cleaning effort increases. In all the cases it is found that appropriate cleaning effort may reduce the impacts of biological invasions on the sustainable use of resources.
