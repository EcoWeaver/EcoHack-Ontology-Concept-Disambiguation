The role of avian frugivores on germination and potential seed dispersal of the Brazilian Pepper Schinus terebinthifolius
Frugivorous birds play a key role in seed dispersal and establishment of a range of plant species, including invasive weeds, such as the Brazilian Pepper Schinus terebinthifolius. The potential of seed dispersal of Schinus by birds with varied feeding behaviours was studied through seed-viability tests and germination experiments using seeds obtained from birds in the field and birds kept in captivity. It was found that seeds collected after gut passage in five bird species in the field had higher proportion of germination as well as higher germination rates compared to the control seeds. Viability of seeds ingested by the Blue-and-yellow Tanager Thraupis bonariensis, which mandibulates seeds before ingesting, was significantly lower than control seeds, while reduction in viability of seeds ingested by the Creamy-bellied Thrush Turdus amaurochalinus was nonsignificant. Seeds ingested by birds in captivity germinated earlier than the control seeds, within 1-2 weeks, and had proportion and germination rates higher than controls. Probably both mechanical and chemical effects play a role in enhancing germination of seeds. In Brazil where both Schinus and avian frugivores had evolved together, the dependence of Schinus on generalist frugivores had been demonstrated in this study, similar to other countries where the invasive Schinus is dependent on native or introduced avian species for its spreading. This finding has important implications for the restoration of human-altered areas in South America, were Schinus is a native pioneer species, as well as for the management and restoration of areas invaded by Schinus elsewhere.
