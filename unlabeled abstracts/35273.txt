Nativeness is not binary - a graduated terminology for native and non-native species in the Anthropocene
With novel ecosystems becoming the norm, it is increasingly necessary to re-evaluate what is meant by "restoration". An important aspect of this concept is what we define to be native and, by extension, alien. In order to better prioritize restoration projects, we have here devised a classification system of ten, graduated terms that describe intermediate states of nativeness which can be applied to different organisms based on their histories, origins and impacts.
