First results on the diet of the invasive Pterois miles (Actinopterygii: Scorpaeniformes: Scorpaenidae) in the Hellenic waters
The diet composition of devil lionfish, Pterois miles (Bennet, 1828), from the Aegean Sea was investigated. The stomach contents of 42 samples (10 of which were empty) collected between May 2016 and November 2017 from Rhodes Island, Greece, were studied. The diet was composed predominantly of bony fish (78.5% in number, approximately 94.7% in biomass) belonging to a large variety of families, and invertebrates (15.4% in number, 5.1% in biomass), thus indicating an opportunistic feeding behaviour of the species in the study area. The length-length and length-weight relations were also determined.
