Invasion of ecosystem engineer--the European beaver (Castor fiber)--in the Tadenka River basin (Prioksko-Terrasnyi Nature Reserve)
The results of analysis of the European beaver (Castor fiber) population dynamics in the Prioksko-Terrasnyi Nature Reserve and its settlements in the Tadenka River basin during 1948-2009 are described. It is shown that, 50 years after beaver reintroduction in the Tadenka River basin, the number of settlements stabilized in the range 9-12. It is found that a slow increase in the number of settlements is mainly associated with the initially adverse environmental conditions on the Tadenka River and subsequent increase in the capacity of habitats as a result of construction activities and use of distant forage resources. The preformed integrated analysis of the settlement distribution, sizes of the occupied areas, number of dams in settlements, specific foraging features, and food resources, as well as mathematical processing of time series data and construction of a model, suggests that the beaver population of the Tadenka River has reached the climax of its development. The further development of this population will mainly depend on functional factors (geomorphologic characteristics of the terrain, the rate of food restoration in abandoned habitats, and the scale and rate of development of the black alder (Alnus glutinosa) communities in the abandoned beaver settlements) influencing the dynamics of the beaver population in the reserve.
