Control of introduced species using Trojan sex chromosomes
To control introduced exotic species that have predominantly genetic, but environmentally reversible, sex determination (e.g. many species of fish), Gutierrez and Teem recently modeled the use of carriers of Trojan Y chromosomes--individuals who are phenotypically sex reversed from their genotype. Repeated introduction of YY females into wild populations should produce extreme male-biased sex ratios and eventual elimination of XX females, thus leading to population extinction. Analogous dynamics are expected in systems in which sex determination is influenced by one or a few major genes on autosomes.
