Three non-indigenous species ofAoroides(Crustacea: Amphipoda: Aoridae) from the French Atlantic coast
The amphipod genusAoroidesis reported for the first time in European marine waters. Specimens ofAoroides semicurvatusandAoroides curvipeswere collected in oyster reefs in Arcachon Bay between 2009 and 2014 and in Hossegor Lake in 2014 (SW France). Specimens ofAoroides longimeruswere collected in 2013 and 2014 in subtidal slipper limpet beds andZostera marinameadows in Arcachon Bay and in 2014 on floating pontoons in the Bay of Brest (W France). These species, native to Asia, may have been accidentally introduced in Arcachon Bay and Hossegor Lake with oyster transfers and in the Bay of Brest through both oyster transfers and shipping.
