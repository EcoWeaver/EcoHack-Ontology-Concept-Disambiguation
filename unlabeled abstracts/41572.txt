Detecting an invasive shrub in a deciduous forest understory using late-fall Landsat sensor imagery
Landsat TM and ETM + imagery was used to distinguish areas of high vs. low cover of Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), taking advantage of the late leaf retention of this invasive shrub. L. maackii cover was measured in eight stands and compared to 15 Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM + images from spring and autumn dates from 1999 to 2006. Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance calculations showed potential separability between high vs. low/zero cover classes of L. maackii on some late fall images. The Soil Adjusted Atmospheric Resistant Vegetation Index (SARVI2) revealed higher levels of green biomass in high L. maackii cover plots than low/zero cover plots for November images only. These findings justify further investigation of the effectiveness of late fall images to map the historical spread of L. maackii and other forest understory invasives with similar phenology.
