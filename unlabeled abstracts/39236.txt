Length-weight relationships of six native and one introduced species in small perennial watercourses of the Choco region of Ecuador
This study estimated the length-weight relationship (LWR) of seven species (six native species and one introduced species) in two small perennial watercourses of the Choco region of Ecuador. Specimens were collected bimonthly with two different fishing methods between August 2016 and July 2017 (Seine net: 46 x 21.20 m, 3 mm mesh size and casting net: 2.10 m radius, 10 mm mesh size). This is the first report of the LWR and a new report on maximum length for two endemic species (Eretmobrycon ecuadorensis and Andinoacara blombergi). The intercept (a) of the LWR ranged from 0.0124 to 0.0316 and the slope (b) ranged from 3.03 and 3.16. The LWRs are useful and, in connection with the collection of other key data on fish biology and the environment they can contribute to management and conservation of the local inland fisheries.
