Life history influences the vulnerability of New Zealand galaxiids to invasive salmonids
Invasion biology often focuses on the life-history traits and the physiological tolerance of introduced species, and on assessing the suitability of receiving habitats. Few studies have examined how trait variation in recipient communities affects the responses of native fauna to pressures from invasive species.This study examines how previously identified life-history differences in a species-complex of native New Zealand galaxiid fish influence their spatial interactions with invasive salmonids (mainly Salmo trutta, but also Oncorhynchus mykiss, O. tshawytscha and Salvelinus fontinalis).A combination of a long-term, broad-scale, presence-absence dataset and a more intensive electrofishing survey was used to examine the extent to which galaxiid species distributions overlap with those of salmonids, and to assess demographic effects associated with salmonid presence. A generalised linear modelling approach was used to test the effect of life history on galaxiid-salmonid interactions while taking into account the possible confounding effects of habitat differences between species distributions.Galaxiid species with 'fast' life-history traits (e.g. high fecundity, small eggs) regularly co-occurred with salmonids over extensive areas, sometimes over long periods, occasionally where salmonid densities were high. In contrast, galaxiid species with 'slow' life-history traits (e.g. low fecundity, large eggs) were almost never found co-occurring with salmonids, and evidence suggested they were most often excluded even where salmonid densities were low. The model outputs indicated that, although habitat played an important role, galaxiid life histories were a dominant factor determining whether species co-occurred with or were excluded by salmonids.The strong influence of interspecific life-history variation on how these closely related galaxiid species interact with salmonids demonstrates the importance of detailed life-history information in predicting how native biota are likely to respond to pressures from invasive species.
