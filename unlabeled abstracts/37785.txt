Risk assessment and management scenarios for ballast water mediated species introductions into the Baltic Sea
This risk assessment study follows the environmental match of donor and recipient regions of ballast water and the voyage duration as risk quantifiers. The ports considered were Gothenburg (Sweden), Copenhagen (Denmark), Kiel (Germany), Klaipeda (Lithuania), Kemi, Tornio and Raahe as one port region (Finland), and Skoldvik/Kilpilahti (Finland). All selected Baltic ports have at least one donor port in the highest risk category, all extreme and high risk donor ports are located in Europe, but mostly outside the Baltic Sea. The most frequently reported high-risk donor ports are Rotterdam (6 times), Bremerhaven (5), Amsterdam (4) and Antwerp (3), and most high-risk donor ports are the major hub ports in Europe. The paper concludes with ballast water management scenarios for intra-Baltic shipping and for vessels engaged on voyages outside the Baltic.
