RiparianSalix alba: Scrubs of the Po lowland (N-Italy) from an European perspective
This paper deals with riverine Salix alba - scrubs of the Po plain (northern Italy). They were compared with analogous formations of many other European countries to study similarities and differences. Demographic concentration and intense human activities (agriculture, industry) in the basin of the Po River are among the highest in Europe, with the remarkable consequence that all hygrophilous woods and bushes contain a high number of alien species. The units dominated by Salix alba were analyzed. Their originality in comparison with the similar associations of Mediterranean, central- and SE-Europe was emphasized.
