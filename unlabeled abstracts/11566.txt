THE EXOTIC DRYWOOD TERMITE CRYPTOTERMES BREVIS (WALKER) (ISOPTERA: KALOTERMITIDAE) AND ENDEMIC AUSTRALIAN DRYWOOD TERMITES IN QUEENSLAND
The important exotic drywood termite Cryptotermes brevis (Walker) was found in 1966 to have become established in Maryborough, Queensland. Survey and eradication work has been complicated by the widespread occurrence of the endemic drywood termite, Cryptotermes primus Hill. Findings made on C. brevis during survey work are discussed, together with relevant data on the distribution and biology of three endemic species.
