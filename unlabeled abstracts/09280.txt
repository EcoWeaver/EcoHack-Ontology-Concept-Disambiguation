Grazing and Substrate Interact to Affect Native vs. Exotic Diversity in Roadside Grasslands
We compared the native and exotic species composition of ungrazed roadside verges with that of adjacent grazed interiors in the grasslands of California's inner northern coast range (Napa and Lake Counties). We sampled 72 pairs of verge and interior quadrats at five sites representative of the region's grasslands, on both fertile (loam) and infertile (serpentine) soils, avoiding all obvious forms of roadside physical disturbance. We found that, on serpentine soils, ungrazed verges had a higher proportion of exotic species than grazed interiors; on nonserpentine soils, the reverse was true. Within serpentine soils, native species were more prevalent in quadrats with lower biomass; within nonserpentine, natives were more prevalent in quadrats receiving less radiation. Overall, the total species diversity was higher in grazed interiors than on ungrazed verges, regardless of the fertility of the substrate. Our results indicate that the ecological role of roadside verges depends on the interactive effects of community composition and history, environmental gradients, and land use practices that characterize a region.
