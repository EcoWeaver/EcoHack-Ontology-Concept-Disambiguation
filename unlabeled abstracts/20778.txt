American Shad of the Pacific Coast: A Harmful Invasive Species or Benign Introduction?
Research on the ecological effects of aquatic invasive species in North America has largely focused on the Laurentian Great Lakes, with less attention directed to their influence in coastal ecosystems. American shad (Alosa sapidissima) were introduced to the Pacific coast in the late 1800s, rapidly established, dispersed, and became prolific. Despite constituting a remarkable biological invasion, shad in their introduced range have not been the subject of much scientific investigation. The species persists in relative obscurity in the Pacific Northwest and remains ecological overlooked and evolutionarily underappreciated. In this second of two complementary articles, we consider the potential ecological effects of invasive American shad on Pacific coastal ecosystems and the possible consequences for the persistence of native salmonids. We also reflect on the intrinsic value that this invasion provides to studies of ecology and evolution and highlight several areas of research that require immediate investigation if we are to determine whether nonindigenous shad constitute a harmful invasive species or a benign introduction.
