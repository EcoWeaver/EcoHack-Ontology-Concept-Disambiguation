Invasive Plant Species as Inhibitors of Restorative Successions
Communities of alien species-transformers able to slow down regenerative successions have been studied. The succession inhibition process was researched through the example of Solidago canadensis L. and Acer negundo L. Fallow and waste lands featuring edaphotopes with nonextreme moisture, pH, and nitrogen richness levels are typical habitats of communities of alien species-transformers. The overwhelming majority of identified phytocoenoses with the predominance of alien transformers are associated with old anthropogenic landscapes.
