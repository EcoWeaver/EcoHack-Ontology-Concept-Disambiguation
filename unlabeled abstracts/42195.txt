Molnar, Cs., Csatho, A. I., Molnar, A. P. & Pifko, D. (2019): Amendments to the alien flora of the Republic of Moldova.- Studia bot. hung. 50(1): 225-240. Abstract: In this paper, eleven alien plant species are presented, two of them are reported for the first time in the Republic of Moldova (Euphorbia maculata, Gaillardia pulchella), one of them has so far been reported only from a botanical garden (Oenothera glazioviana), and eight species were previously known from a few localities in Moldova (Amaranthus powelii, Centaurea diffusa, Grindelia squarrosa, Gypsophila perfoliata, Ruta graveolens, Silphium perfoliatum, Sorghum halepense and Tragus racemosus). We also present an indigenous species which behaves as invasive (Rumex thyrsiflorus). We collected plants primarily on roadsides, along railway lines and in settlements, less oft en in natural habitats. Our goal is to report scattered data here. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Hungarian Natural History Museum, Botanical Department, Herbarium Generale (BP).
