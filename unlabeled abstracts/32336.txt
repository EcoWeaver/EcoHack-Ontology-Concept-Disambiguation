Effect of Shoot Cutting on Trace Metal Concentration in Leaves and Capitula of Potential Phytoaccumulator, Invasive Erigeron annuus (Asteraceae)
AbstractThe effect of shoot cutting was tested on cadmium, lead and zinc concentration in leaves and capitula of Erigeron annuus, an invasive species, which is considered as a potential phytoremediator. Plant material and soil were collected in the city center of Krakow, southern Poland, considered as one of the most contaminated cities in Europe. We proved that the concentration of zinc in leaves and capitula was higher after regrowth, concentration of cadmium was lower in capitula than in leaves, and the average value of bio-concentration factor for zinc and cadmium was less than 1, whereas for lead it was greater than 1 in both plant organs. Our results suggested that E. annuus can be potentially used for phytoremediation of lead and cutting the shoots can promote effectiveness of zinc removal from the contaminated soil.
