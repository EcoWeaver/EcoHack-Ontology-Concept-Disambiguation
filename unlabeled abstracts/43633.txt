Invasion and upstream migration by glass-eels of Anguilla australis australis Richardson and A. reinhardtii Steindachner in Tasmanian Freshwater Streams
The recruitment of glass-eels into fresh water was investigated by hand-netting and electrofishing at the lowest permanent freshwater riffle on several streams in eastern Tasmania. Measurements of the forward extent of the dorsal fin distinguished the short-finned eel, A. a. australis, from the long-finned eel, A. reinhardtii; this separation was verified by vertebral counts and A. a, australis glass-eels were found to be larger than A. reinhardtii. A. a. australis glass-eels were collected at the first riffle during all seasons of the year except mid-summer. Numbers in the catch declined during mid-winter, probably as a result of an effective seaward movement of the freshwater-estuarine interface during periods of high river flow; A. a. australis glass-eels were still found to be abundant near estuary mouths at such times. A. reinhardtii glass-eels exhibited a more restricted movement into fresh water during late summer and autumn with no collections recorded after mid-winter. For both species, the stage of pigmentation was found to advance as the season progressed, and length, weight and condition factor declined with advancing pigmentation. The otoliths of invading glass-eels of both species appeared similar with a single summer ring, suggesting a larval life of 1-1 1/2 years. The restricted invasion period of A. reinhardtii and the similar size throughout the species range suggests a short and precise larval life. The length of larval life of A. a. australis is probably quite variable, resulting in a more substantial and prolonged influx of glass-eels into Tasmanian waters.
