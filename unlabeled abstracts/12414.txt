Evaluation of Chemical Defense and Chemical Diversity in the Exotic Bryozoan Amathia verticillata
The present investigation tests the effects against feeding by fishes of crude extracts obtained from eleven distinct populations of the bryozoan Amathia verticillata, an invasive species found globally in tropical to warm-temperate waters. Investigation of extracts from 11 populations of A. verticillata led to the identification and quantification of the known indole alkaloid 2,5,6-tribromo-N-methylgramine and isolation and identification of the new indole alkaloid, 2,6-dibromo-N-methylgramine. One extract of A. verticillata from Brazil significantly deterred feeding, while other extracts of A. verticillata from Florida significantly stimulated feeding by fishes, in field assays performed in Brazil. The same extracts of Florida samples showed variable effects on feeding, ranging from attraction to deterrence, in assays carried out in Florida. The absence of broad chemical defenses against feeding by fish suggests that the establishment of A. verticillata as an invasive species into new areas may be due to reasons other than defensive chemistry.
