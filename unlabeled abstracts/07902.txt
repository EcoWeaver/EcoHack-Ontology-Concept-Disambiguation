Biology and ecology of Appendiseta robiniae (Hemiptera: Aphidoidea) -- an alien species in Europe
Abstract Elements of the biology and ecology of A. robiniae were studied in Poland during the period of 2008-2009. The term of spring hatching, number of generations per season, developmental time of particular generations, lifespan of specimens and fecundity of particular generations were all defined. The dynamics of the species' occurrence on its host plant were also determined. The two-year study showed a maximum of 11 aphid generations can develop on Robinia pseudoacacia. Females of the second and third generations were found to be the most fertile. These findings indicate that the species has adapted well in Poland and its biological predispositions have enabled it to rapidly increase in population.
