Tradescantia fluminensis, an exotic weed affecting native forest regeneration in New Zealand: Ecological surveys, safety tests and releases of four biocontrol agents from Brazil
biocontrol agents. Their larvae cause potentially complementary damage to leaves, shoot-tips and mature stems, respectively. Several pathogens, including a rust, were rejected before we selected the Kordyana species. Host range testing of all four agents showed sufficient host-specificity for consideration for release in NZ. Neolema ogloblini and L. basicostata were field-released in NZ in 2011 and 2012, with the field-release of N. abbreviata due late 2012. An application to release Kordyana sp. in NZ has been made.
