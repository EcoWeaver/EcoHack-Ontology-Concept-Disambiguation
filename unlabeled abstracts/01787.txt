Histological and ultrastructural characteristics of the testis of the invasive suckermouth sailfin catfish Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus (Siluriformes: loricariidae) from Marikina River, Philippines
The histological and ultrastructural features of the testis of the invasive suckermouth sailfin catfish Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus rapidly proliferating in Marikina River, Philippines were characterized during the fish's 2010-2011 reproductive season. The germinal compartment of the testes was composed of anastomosing tubules with cysts undergoing synchronous development. Spermatogenic cells were along the length of the testes indicate it to be of the unrestricted spermatogonial type. The spermatozoon is classified as type 1 ect aquasperm devoid of acrosome, has rounded nucleus, and a long flagellum--characteristics necessary for external fertilization. Male P. disjunctivus was reproductively active during half of the year-long study with peak spawning during the most rainy months (June to August) and prolonged recrudescence during the dry months (February to May). Results from this study form a histological baseline to describe the gonad dynamics and reproduction of this invasive fish species as well as provide possible means of mechanical control to curb the population of the fish in this river.
