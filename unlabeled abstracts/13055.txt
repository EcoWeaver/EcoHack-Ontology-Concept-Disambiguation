Is metabarcoding suitable for estuarine plankton monitoring? A comparative study with microscopy
Metabarcoding is becoming an increasingly valuable alternative approach to biodiversity assessment, due to the combination of extreme sensitivity and potential for the highest taxonomic resolution in a cost- and time-effective methodology. To evaluate the capacity of metabarcoding for estuarine plankton monitoring, a comparison between the results obtained with this approach were compared with those based on traditional taxonomic analysis (microscopy). Database incompleteness, one of the main limitations of metabarcoding, was somewhat overcome by the addition of DNA sequences for local species, which increased the taxonomic assignment success from 23.7 to 50.5 %. When the communities were studied along with environmental variables, similar spatial and temporal trends of taxonomic diversity were observed for metabarcoding and microscopic studies of zooplankton, but not for phytoplankton. This is most likely attributable to the lack of representative sequences for phytoplankton species in current databases. In addition, there was high correspondence in community composition when comparing abundances estimated from metabarcoding and microscopy, suggesting semiquantitative potential for metabarcoding. Furthermore, metabarcoding allowed the detection and identification of two non-indigenous species (NIS) found in the study area at abundances hardly detectable by microscopy. Overall, our results indicate that metabarcoding is a powerful approach with excellent possibilities for use in plankton monitoring, early detection of NIS and plankton biodiversity shifts.
