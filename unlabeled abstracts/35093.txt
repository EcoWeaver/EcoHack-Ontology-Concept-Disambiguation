A new piece in the puzzle for the riverine slugs of the Acochlidiidae (Gastropoda: Panpulmonata: Acochlidimorpha) helps tracing steps of their freshwater invasion
AbstractGastropods (slugs and snails) are prominent and species-rich faunal elements in marine and terrestrial habitats of the tropics. While several clades of snails inhabit freshwater systems, slugs are extremely rare in freshwater: only the centimeter-sized Acochlidiidae, with currently three genera, contain more than one species and live in the lower reaches of island streams in an area comprising Eastern Indonesia, Fiji, and Palau. Where known, the species of this unique group are specialized predators of other amphidromous snails' egg capsules (Neritidae) and their reproductive biology and adaptations to life in freshwater are complex. Acochlidiidae are thus of special interest for evolutionary biology and ecology. We here describe a new genus of unusually bluish-green acochlidiid to date known only from a single locality on the island of Ambon, Indonesia. Previous molecular data found this charismatic species to link slender Strubellia slugs with broad and flattened Acochlidium and Palliohedyle. We establish Wallacellia siputbiru n. gen. n. sp., the "blue slug" in Bahasa Indonesia, by using scanning electron microscopy of cuticular elements, light microscopy of serial semithin histological sections of the soft body, and 3D reconstruction of all organ systems based on these sections. Special structures of this seemingly rare endemic species include the enlarged kidney and the huge copulatory organ. Our data now clarify that, in the invasion of freshwater habitats in Acochlidiidae, sexual selection (the anterior three-part copulatory organ) preceded ecological selection (posterior flattened habitus with branched or multiplied internal organs).
