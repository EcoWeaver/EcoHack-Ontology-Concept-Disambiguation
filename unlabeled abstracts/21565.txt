Species diversity and drivers of spread of alien fungi (sensu lato) in Europe with a particular focus on France
A first comprehensive inventory of alien fungi and fungal-like organisms (in Stramenopila) recorded in France since 1800 was established, comprising 227 species, with 64.7% plant pathogens, 29.5% saprotrophic species, 3.5% ectomycorrhizal fungi, 1.3% animal parasites and 0.9% mycopathogenic fungi. Using this and a previously built European dataset, correlates of invasion success in fungi (sensu lato) were investigated, especially for pathogenic species occurring in wild environments (mostly forest tree pathogens). Several common features were demonstrated at the two spatial scales. Some taxonomic/phylogenetic orders were shown to be over-represented in alien fungi and Stramenopila pseudo-fungi, e.g. Peronosporales and to have faster spread, e.g. Erysiphales. Residence time and economic variables, especially imports, were important explaining variables of the levels of invasion. The influence of climatic factors was also suggested.
