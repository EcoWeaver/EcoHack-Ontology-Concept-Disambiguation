ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR FOR RADIALLY SYMMETRIC SOLUTIONS OF A LOGISTIC EQUATION WITH A FREE BOUNDARY
In this paper we investigate a logistic equation with a new free boundary condition appearing in ecology, we aim to describe the spreading of a new or invasive species by studying the asymptotic behavior of the radially symmetric solutions of the problem. We will obtain a trichotomy result: spreading (the solution converges to a stationary solution defined on the half-line), transition (the solution converges to a stationary solution with compact support) and vanishing (the solution converges to 0 within a finite time). Besides we can also obtain a dichotomy result (either spreading or vanishing happens). Moreover, in the spreading case, we give the sharp estimate of the asymptotic spreading speed of the free boundary.
