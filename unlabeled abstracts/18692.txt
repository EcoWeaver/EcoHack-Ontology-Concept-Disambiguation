Recruitment of the invasive kelp Undaria pinnatifida does not always benefit from disturbance to native algal communities in low-intertidal habitats
Disturbance can play an important role in accelerating the spread of invasive species in coastal habitats by increasing the availability of resources. Thus, reductions in native canopy cover often facilitate the establishment of invasive macroalgae. In this study, the invasion process of the kelp Undaria pinnatifida in disturbed patches on a rocky low-intertidal shore in central New Zealand was investigated. The study site was initially uninvaded, but adjacent to (~150 m) intertidal areas with established U. pinnatifida populations. Experimental plots (0.25 m2) were established that were either partially (50%) or totally (100%) cleared of native algal cover at two different times of year (summer: December 2008 and winter: June 2009). U. pinnatifida recruitment was monitored for 3, 6, 9 and 12 months for the summer run, and for 3 and 6 months for the winter run. Although the timing of first appearance varied across the two runs, we were unable to detect an effect of clearing native algae on U. pinnatifida recruitment. By the end of the experiment, U. pinnatifida had recruited into all plot treatment types at low densities (on average 1.4 plants 0.25 m-2). The fact that U. pinnatifida recruited into the uncleared control plots indicated that invasion of this kelp into new areas does not require disturbance of the native algal community. These results suggest that if light and space are not limiting resources, as is likely the case in this low-intertidal habitat, then disturbance may not facilitate U. pinnatifida recruitment.
