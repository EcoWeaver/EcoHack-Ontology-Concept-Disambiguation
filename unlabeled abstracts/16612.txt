Report of Xiphophorus hellerii in the arid Metztitlan Canyon Biosphere Reserve in Mexico
Biosphere reserves have been established around the world as a means to protect sensitive or threatened ecoregions and the biodiversity within them. As such, the organisms occurring within these reserves are important from a conservation perspective as they often represent endemic species or remnant populations. Here we provide genetic evidence of widespread occurrence of Xiphophorus helleri within the Metztitlan Canyon Biosphere Reserve in Hidalgo, Mexico. One nuclear and two mitochondrial genes were sequenced from four populations within the canyon and confirmed that the specimens collected were X. hellerii. When compared to published sequences of X. hellerii from multiple localities within the documented natural range of the species, the specimens from Metztitlan were found to exhibit between 0 and 1.6 % sequence divergence. Possible scenarios for colonization of the canyon and conservation implications are discussed.
