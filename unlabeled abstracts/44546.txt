Dietary plasticity in an invasive species and implications for management: the case of the monk parakeet in a Mediterranean city
Behavioural flexibility may play a relevant role during invasion of a new habitat. A typical example of behavioural flexibility favouring invasion success refers to changes in foraging behaviour. Here we provide data on changes in the foraging strategies of monk parakeets Myiopsitta monachus over a period of 17 years (2001-2017) in Barcelona city. During this time, consumption of food on the ground increased by more than 25 % and the consumption of anthropogenic food increased by 8 %. Detailed information about the food consumed is provided. Feeding on the ground and consumption of low plants allow parakeets to reach not only anthropogenic food but also crops, thereby increasing the risk of crop damage as the invasion evolves. Early detection of damage to crops is crucial in order to prevent further harm, and makes the precautionary principle highly relevant.
