Additional records of Bregmaceros atlanticus in the eastern Mediterranean--an invasion through the Suez Canal or in ballast water?
The recent findings of several specimens of the antenna codlet, Bregmaceros atlanticus, in shallow waters off the Israeli and Turkish coasts raise the question of their origin. It is considered unlikely that these records indicate the existence of a small native population in the Mediterranean. Though unrecorded from the Red Sea, it may be yet another Erythrean alien, or it may have entered the Mediterranean in ballast water.
