Understanding the role of species dynamics in abundance-occupancy relationships
1. The positive interspecific abundance-occupancy relationship (AOR) is a ubiquitous, but highly variable ecological pattern. Understanding this variation is a key challenge for community ecologists and little progress has been made using ecological trait data to predict variation in abundance and occupancy. 2. We used a data set from vascular plants in New Zealand South Island tussock grasslands measured at a landscape scale over 25 years to analyse AORs within a single habitat type. 3. We firstly modelled the interspecific relationship between abundance and occupancy across species. We then measured the deviations in the slopes of the abundance-occupancy relationship for individual species from this overall interspecific relationship and related these slope deviations to data on species' life-history and ecological traits. 4. Highly invasive species that increased their ranges and abundances during the 25-year study period had significantly steeper slopes in abundance-occupancy space than the interspecific relationship although species with increased dispersal ability did not. Those species that were clonal showed significantly shallower slopes suggesting that clonality causes species to respond more slowly in occupancy than abundance to changes in their environment. 5. Synthesis. These results show that considering the population dynamics of individual species allows us to relate species' traits to their trajectory over time in abundance-occupancy space and thus can lead to a better understanding of the variation and scatter around the interspecific abundance-occupancy pattern.
