Interactive effects of calcium decline and predation risk on the potential for a continuing northward range expansion of the rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus)
Over the last three decades, the rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus (Girard, 1852)) has been expanding its range northward via human-mediated dispersal. If this species is to continue expanding its range northward, it will move onto the Canadian Shield, where calcium (Ca) availability is low and is predicted to decline further in the future. Dissolved Ca is a vital functional component of mollusc and crustacean physiology, important for exoskeletal condition and strength, as well as metabolic activity. However, some organisms are able to compensate for reduced structural integrity by modifying their behaviour. In this study, we asked if the invasive O. rusticus can survive low levels of ambient Ca and, if it can, whether it exhibits modified antipredator behavior in response to the physiological limitations imposed by low [Ca]. We found that, under reduced Ca levels, O. rusticus reduced the frequency of standard activities (such as grooming and foraging) and was more likely to engage in vigilance and (or) escape behavior. We also found that some individuals, in extremely low [Ca], died while molting. This study suggests that Ca limitation on the Shield, especially where predators are present, may limit the northward expansion of O. rusticus beyond their current range limit.
