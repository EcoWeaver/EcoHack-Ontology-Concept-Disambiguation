Forest edges enhance mate-finding in the invasive European gypsy moth,Lymantria dispar
Habitat type, fragmentation, and edge effects can play important roles in the mate-finding abilities of many species. These effects can be particularly pronounced in low-density populations, which are often found at the margins of species' ranges or at the leading edge of an invasion. The European gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is a non-native insect defoliator in the USA and Canada, where flightless females attract male moths through pheromone production and local extirpation of low-density populations can be due to mate-finding failure. To assess the effects of habitat edges on the ability of gypsy moths to find mates, we conducted a release experiment with male gypsy moths using female-baited trap arrays in fields, at forest edges, and in the forest interior. Reduced mate-finding was expected in fields and near forest edges based on geographic variation in invasion rates, male flight behavior, and pheromone plume dynamics. However, we found that mate-finding was highest at forest edges, reduced in fields, and lowest within the forest interior. Within an array, traps closest to the forest edge also had the highest mate-finding, suggesting that habitat characteristics can influence male flight direction in addition to pheromone cues. These results suggest that a moderate level of forest fragmentation enhances mate-finding ability in the gypsy moth. Understanding the relationship between habitat heterogeneity and mate-finding success in invasive species can inform predictions of future spread and assist with management plans that target mating disruption.
