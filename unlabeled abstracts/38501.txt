Ecological correlates of invasion by Arundo donax in three southern California riparian habitats
Arundo donax L. (Poaceae) is an aggressive invader in California's riparian habitats. Field experiments were conducted to examine invader and site attributes important in early invasion. One hundred A.donax rhizomes were planted along five transects into each of three southern California riparian habitats. Pre-planting rhizome weight was recorded, along with site variables including percent bare ground, litter depth, PAR, soil moisture, soil temperature, incidence of herbivory, native canopy cover, and plant community richness and diversity. A.donax shoot emergence, survival time, and shoot height were recorded for approximately 10months. The experiment was repeated over three years in different locations within each site. When years and sites were pooled to reveal large-scale patterns, A.donax performance was explained by rhizome weight, soil moisture, bare ground, soil temperature, and herbivory. When each site was considered singly, A.donax was positively correlated with different variables in each location. Species richness was correlated with A.donax performance in only one site. Our results indicate that A.donax establishment in riparian habitats is promoted by both vegetative reproduction and favorable abiotic environmental factors and relatively unaffected by the composition of the native community. The positive response of A.donax to disturbance (bare ground) and high resource availability (soil moisture), combined with a competitive perennial habit suggest that this species takes advantage of a competitive-ruderal life history. The ability of A.donax to respond to different conditions in each site combined with low genetic and phenotypic variation seen in other studies also suggests that a high degree of environmental tolerance contributes to invasion success.
