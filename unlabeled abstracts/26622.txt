Mass occurrence of an introduced crustacean (Caprella cf. mutica) in the south-eastern North Sea
The caprellid amphipod Caprella mutica is indigenous to coastal waters of north-east Asia and was first recorded in European waters in 1995. We now detected mass occurrences of > 3000 individuals per m2 in harbours of the two islands of Sylt and Helgoland in the German Bight, North Sea. Currently, Caprella mutica seems to be restricted to artificial hard substrata but we expect it to become a new species in natural hard bottom assemblages of that region as well.
