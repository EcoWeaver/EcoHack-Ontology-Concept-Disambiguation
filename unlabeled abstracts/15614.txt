Population and reproductive characteristics of a non-native western tubenose goby (Proterorhinus semilunaris) population unaffected by gobiid competitors
The western tubenose goby (Proterorhinus semilunaris) is one of several Ponto-Caspian gobiid species currently extending their distribution range over Europe. As part of an ongoing study, we examined the annual dynamics of an established tubenose goby population from the River Dyje (Czech Republic, Danube basin), 13 years after its first occurrence. Monthly monitoring (February 2011-January 2012) confirmed that the species dominates the local fish assemblage (more than two thirds of fish caught) and is the only species captured every month. The population is female-dominated from March-August and displays a 1:1 sex-ratio from September on. Tubenose gobies in the Dyje are characterised by rapid reproduction and early maturation, with all 0+ fish ready to spawn at the start of the next spawning season. Females display significantly higher GSI but lower body condition and a shorter life-span than males. Female life-span was almost strictly annual, while males were more likely to survive to a second spawning season. This study is unique in presenting results for a tubenose goby population with long-term absence of other potentially competing gobiid species. These results provide new baseline data for future tubenose goby studies in areas both with and without competitors.
