Establishment success of plant immigrants in a new water reservoir
The set of 25 aquatic and shoreline species which immigrated to the new reservoir Rozkos during the 21 years after its creation were analyzed with respect to their time of immigration, distance of nearest source localities, life form, seed size, and reproductive system. The reservoir consists of two parts, one with fluctuating and the other with stabilized water level. The immigrating species originated from various distances, from nearby to more than 100 km away. A distance of tens of kilometers can be overcome by many shoreline species, provided that suitable (low competition) habitats are available. The survival time was correlated with the reproductive system: species with autogamic or vegetative reproduction survived longer. Establishment was more successful under a fluctuating water level, which decreased the competitive exclusion of immigrated species by helophytes.
