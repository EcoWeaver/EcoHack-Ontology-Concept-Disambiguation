Invasion of New Aquatic Habitats by Male Freshwater Turtles
Long-term field research often reveals how organisms respond to stochastic environmental events such as droughts (Gibbons et al., 1983) or changes in population structure or species composition over time (Tinkle, 1979; Parker, 1984; Pechmann et al., 199 1). Studies on aquat-ic turtle populations have been conducted for more than 25 years on the US Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS) near Aiken in the Upper Coastal Plain of west central South Carolina (Gibbons et al., 1982; Gibbons, 1990a; Frazer et al., 199 1). One conclusion from these studies is that adult males residing in small, iso-lated wetlands are more likely than females to move overland and to move greater distances (Morreale et al., 1984). Factors reported to stimulate overland move-ments by freshwater turtles include travel to and from hibernacula (Bennett, 1972; Gibbons, 1986), pond drying/filling (Cagle, 1944; Sex-ton, 1959; Gibbons et al., 1983), nesting activity of females (Ernst et al., 1994), and mate-search-ing by males (Parker, 1984; Gibbons, 1986). Although male and female conspecifics proba-bly exhibit similar terrestrial activity in some situations, differences in reproductive strategies should produce distinct terrestrial activity pat-terns. Previous studies have suggested that fe-males sometimes travel long distances on land to nest but that males may also travel long dis-tances overland seeking aquatic habitats con-taining females to inseminate (Morreale et al., 1984; Gibbons, 1986; Brown and Brooks, 1993). If these predictions are correct, males should be more likely than females to encounter new aquatic habitats, including those without con-specific populations. Therefore, colonizing or invading nonresident species should have male-biased sex ratios relative to established resident species. Here we report on captures of 10 spe-cies of aquatic turtles and compare sex ratios of six established resident species to those of Kin-osternon baurii and Chrysemys picta. Materials and methods.-Observations described here are based on data collected from 1967-1993 at Ellenton Bay, a freshwater wetland lo-cated on the SRS. Ellenton Bay is a 10-ha Car-olina bay with a maximum water depth of ap-proximately 2 m. Although the bay contains water year-round during most years, surface area and water depth vary seasonally and annually (Gibbons and Semlitsch, 199 1). Turtles were captured using a variety of tech-niques including aquatic traps, pitfall traps along drift fences, and hand captures. All captured turtles were brought to a laboratory facility, where they were identified to species, mea-sured, sexed, and given individual marks (Gib-bons, 1990b). Each turtle was then released at the point of capture. Depending on the species, sexual maturity in males was determined by the presence of enlarged tails or elongated fore-claws. The identification of individuals not readily distinguishable as K. baurii or K. subru-brum was confirmed by performing the calcu-lations presented by Lamb (1983). Results.-Ten species of aquatic turtles were captured at the Ellenton Bay drift fence be-tween 1967 and 1993: Trachemys scripta, K. sub-rubrum, PseudemysJEoridana, Sternotherus odora-tus, Chelydra serpentina, Deirochelys reticularia, Pseudemys concinna, Clemmys guttata, Chrysemys picta, and K. baurii. The first six species are known to nest at Ellenton Bay, based on the capture of hatchlings, and have been captured in most years since 1967. These species are con-sidered resident populations. Only mature in-dividuals have been verified for K. baurii (n = 30), C. picta (n = 5), C. guttata (n = 5), and P. concinna (n = 1). Hence, these species are con-sidered nonresidents. Individuals of C , guttata, C. picta, and K. baurii were first captured at Ellenton Bay in 1980, 1980, and 1987, respectively. Prior to 1980, 1663 adults of the six resident turtle species had been captured. An additional 1045 adults of these species were captured at Ellenton Bay af-ter 1980. Of the 2708 mature animals of these six species captured from 1967-1993,45-64% were males, depending on the species (Table 1). All K. baurii and C. picta captured through 1993 at Ellenton Bay have been males (Table 1). One of five C. guttata and the one P. concinna were females. The residency times for individ-uals ranged from 14-32 days for C. guttata, 2 1-89 days for C. picta and 10-577 days for K. baurii. The single P. concinna has apparently remained in Ellenton Bay since 1980 based on recaptures over several years.
