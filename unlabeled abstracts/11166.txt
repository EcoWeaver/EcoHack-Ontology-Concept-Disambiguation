Percnon gibbesi (H. Milne Edwards, 1853) and Callinectes sapidus (Rathbun, 1896) in the Ligurian Sea: two additional invasive species detections made in collaboration with local fishermen
The non-indigenous crabs Percnon gibbesi (H. Milne Edwards, 1853) and Callinectes sapidus (Rathbun, 1896) (Crustacea, Decapoda, Portunidae) are reported from Genoa and La Spezia, respectively, in the Ligurian Sea at the northern rim of the Mediterranean Sea. Both specimens were collected by fishermen who then brought them to the attention of professional scientists. This illustrates the importance of engaging local communities in detecting non-indigenous species and monitoring their spread.
