Additions to the Fish Fauna of Oklahoma with a Summary of Introduced Species
Report of the collection and distribution in Oklahoma of six fishes not previously recorded from the state (Salmo trutta, Hiodon tergisus, Ictalurus nebulosus, Typhlichthys subterraneus, Fundulus catenatus, Roccus saxatilis) brings the total number of species known from Oklahoma to 167. Three of the six represent introduced forms. A list of all exotic fishes known to be introduced into Oklahoma waters, with the available history of introduction, is included. Of the 14 known or postulated to be introduced, 5 are utilized as bait species and 9 were introduced as additional food for game fishes. Eight have had varying degrees of reproductive success; 5 of the game fishes were not expected to provide reproducing populations, and their success is dependent on continual restocking. Only the introduction of the tench, Tinca tinca, can be considered unsuccessful.
