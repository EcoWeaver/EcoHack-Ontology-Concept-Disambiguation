Impacts of tree plantations in the Ethiopian highland on soil fertility, shoot and root growth, nutrient utilisation and mycorrhizal colonisation
In order to elucidate ecological effects of plantation establishment in Ethiopia, soil physical and chemical characteristics, above-ground herbaceous biomass and nutrient content, fine root biomass and productivity and mycorrhizal colonisation were studied in a natural montane forest and in adjacent 28-40 year old plantations of the exotic species Cupressus lusitanica and Eucalyptus globulus and the indigenous Juniperus procera. The field studies were combined with bioassays of growth and nutrient uptake of Acacia abyssinica, Chloris virgata and Eragrostis tef in soils derived from each site.
