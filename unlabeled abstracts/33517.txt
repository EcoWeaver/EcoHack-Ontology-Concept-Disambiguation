Alterations of stool metabolome, phenome, and microbiome of the marine fish, red sea bream, Pagrus major, following exposure to phenanthrene: A non-invasive approach for exposure assessment
The present study aimed to assess the impact of phenanthrene (Phe) on fish health by addressing the alteration of fecal characteristics, in lieu of collecting biomarkers that often involves injurious or even fatal sampling of organisms. The marine fish red sea bream, Pagrus major, was exposed to Phe at a concentration of 18 mg/L for 16 days followed by depuration for 13 days. We collected feces from Phe-exposed or control (Phe-free) fish and then analyzed the fecal metabolite profile (metabolome), carbon utilization of microbiota (phenome), and bacterial 16s rRNA gene sequence (microbiome). Along with the increase in physiological stress markers (SOD and EROD) in serum and liver, we noted the possible role of intestine as a Phe reservoir. Furthermore, abnormal fecal appearance (green coloration) and remarkable changes in fecal characteristics were observed. These changes include alterations of cholesterol and putrescine metabolism and the enhanced utilization of putrescine as a carbon source. Phe also altered the microbial community, with an increase in Phe-degrading bacteria such as Pseudomonas. Interestingly, these enteric impairments were ameliorated by depuration. Taken together, our findings suggest that these alterations in feces were associated with adaptive responses to environmentally relevant Phe exposure scenarios, and that stool samples are potential candidates for exposure assessment in fish.
