Invasive species based efficient green technology for phytoremediation of fly ash deposits
The present investigation was focused to examine the phytoremediation potential of naturally grown Ipomoea carnea on fly ash (FA) deposits. I. carnea is an invasive species and mostly neglected by people but it has unusual characteristics which deals to phytoremediation. The metal accumulation of Cd, Pb, Cu, Cr, Mn and Ni ranged from 5.3 to 39.7, 7.4 to 30.6, 19.9 to 32.5, 9.5 to 20.6, 19.0 to 90.1, and 13.7 to 68.2 mg g- 1, respectively, in all the parts of I. carnea grown on barren FA deposits during two periods (pre- and post-monsoon). The bioconcentration factor (BCF) values of Cd, Pb, Mn, and Ni in root and stem were greater than 1 during both periods which indicates the metal accumulation potential of I. carnea. There is a dearth of study recommending the safe and effective green technology for the phytoremediation of FA dumps. In this regards, I. carnea was identified as an effective plant for phytoremediation in harsh environmental conditions of abandoned FA deposits.
