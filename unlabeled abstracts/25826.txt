Guidelines for improved management of riparian zones invaded by alien plants in South Africa
This paper reviews the results of recent research on riparian vegetation recovery following the clearance of invasive alien plants. In Fynbos, Grassland and Savanna Biomes, riparian ecosystems were found to have relatively-high ecological resilience to invasion by alien plants, except in some situations of closed alien stands (75-100% aerial cover). Where alien invasion is the primary disturbance at a site, and invasion intensity is low (
