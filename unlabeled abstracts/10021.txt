A modular approach to biomass allocation in an invasive annual (Microstegium vimineum; Poaceae).
The invasive grass Microstegium vimineum grows in low light beneath the canopy of eastern forests in North America by reiteration of modules (phytomers) along a tiller. Basal phytomers are vegetative; terminal phytomers produce a raceme of chasmogamous (CH) spikelets plus an axillary raceme of cleistogamous (CL) spikelets. Additional subterminal phytomers with CL racemes mature basipetally. Allocation to culms, leaves, and CH and CL within phytomers was examined in relation to light conditions for a population in New Jersey, USA. Plants were reared in a greenhouse from seed families of parents in deep shade (2-8% full sun) or sunny, edge habitats. Primary tillers were subdivided into phytomers, dried, and weighed. Tillers from field habitats were similarly treated. For vegetative and subterminal phytomers, allocation to leaves and CH was greatest for the shady habitat. CL allocation decreased from terminal to reproductively immature subterminal phytomers. CH and CL mass was positively correlated with leaf mass, suggesting that reproduction is determined by available photosynthate. CH mass showed a genetic correlation with leaf mass. Developmental plasticity in modular allocation allows Microstegium to maximize fitness when conditions are favorable (e.g., high light along forest edges) by continual maturation of CL caryopses on axillary racemes.
