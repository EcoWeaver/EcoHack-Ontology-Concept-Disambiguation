Complete mitochondrial DNA sequences of two haplotypes of the smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu, collected from nonindigenous populations in Japan
We determined the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of two haplotypes of the smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu; individuals used in the analysis were collected from nonindigenous populations in Japan. Both genomes comprised 16,488bp, with genome contents and gene orders being identical to those of other teleost fishes. A previous study revealed that the Japanese smallmouth bass had only two haplotypes, and the present study revealed that the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of the haplotypes differed in only one nucleotide difference. The low genetic diversity in the mtDNA of the smallmouth bass individuals in our study and the results of the mtDNA sequence comparison between the Japanese and the North American individuals suggested that the fish had been transplanted from a fish farm with a low-diversity stock.
