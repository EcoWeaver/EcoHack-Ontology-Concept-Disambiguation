Patterns in spatial segregation between the endemic Nicobar Bulbul (Ixos nicobariensis) and the introduced Red-whiskered Bulbul (Pycnonotus jocosus) on two islands of central Nicobar
Introduced and invasive species are emerging as a significant threat to biodiversity, especially to endemic species, worldwide. One of the ways in which introduced species might impact native species is through competition for space, mediated through interspecific interactions. The Red-whiskered Bulbul (Pycnonotus jocosus) is one such species that was introduced to the central Nicobar from mainland India in the late 1800s. Several bird studies from the region postulate that it may pose a serious threat to the endemic Nicobar Bulbul (Ixos nicobariensis). In this study we explored broad patterns in habitat-use intensity of these 2 bulbuls using point counts. Further, we conducted playback trials to assess the nature of their interspecific interactions. Our results show that these 2 species show segregation in habitat use. The Nicobar Bulbul is a forest-dwelling species showing preference for primary forests, while the Red-whiskered Bulbul occurs in the secondary habitats around human habitation. Further, the playback experiments failed to yield any interspecific response indicating a lack of interspecific aggression. We believe that both species, being evolutionarily distinct, naturally segregate themselves on the currently available habitats on these islands. However, destruction of primary forest for plantations and infrastructure development might be a more immediate threat to the endemic Nicobar Bulbul.
