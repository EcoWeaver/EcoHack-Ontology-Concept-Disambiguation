Enhanced inulinase production by Fusarium solani JALPK from invasive weed using response surface methodology
The present study is the first report of utilizing Tithonia rotundifolia weed as a substrate for inulinase production from Fusarium solani JALPK. It also deals with the statistical optimization of culture conditions to enhance the enzyme yield. Amongst the 11 variables screened by Plackett- Burman design, Inulin in combination with Agave sisalana extract, Tithonia rotundifolia extract and NaNO3 had a significant influence on inulinase production and their concentrations were further optimized employing Box Behnken design. An enhancement of inulinase production from 970EU/mL to 3261.011EU/mL was gained after media optimization. Amongst the screened carbon sources Tithonia rotundifolia was found to be very effective in stimulating elevated inulinase synthesis. The Tithonia rotundifolia weed extract was treated with inulinase from Fusarium solani JALPK to form fructose which was estimated spectrophotometrically. This liberated fructose was also confirmed by osazone formation test and FTIR. HPTLC analysis of product revealed the exoinulinase nature of the enzyme produced by Fusarium solani JALPK since fructose was the only end product after hydrolysis of inulin rich weed in fermented broth. Thus the elevated extracellular inulinase yielding novel property of Fusarium solani JALPK (KY914560) contributes in considering it as a potential candidate with food, pharmaceutical and bioremediation applications
