Problem-analytical database of Invasive species: structure, functions and perspectives of application
Alongside global climatic and anthropogenic changes of the second half of the XX century, problems of expanding habitats and the negative impact of invasive species on natural ecosystems have become more acute. Biological invasions are caused by a number of natural and anthropogenic factors: invasions associated with outbreaks of the population and the expansion of the habitat; introduction for practical purposes and cultivation in botanical gardens, nurseries; accidental spreading by transport network, by import of agricultural products, etc. Strategies for mitigating the effects of invasive species on the environment consist of objective assessments and reliable forecasts based on various potential scenarios of climate change and extent of environmental degradation. The database "Invasive species" was developed as the main component of the regional monitoring network of the resettlement control of invasive and potentially invasive plant species. It is based on the accumulation, generalization and multivariate analysis data analysis and the possibility of predicting further invasions under different scenarios of environmental changes. The obtained results will be the basis for the development of a new integrated technology for risks assessment of invasion and the widest usage of effective methods of biocontrol in agriculture and forestry, health care and biodiversity conservation, monitoring of the invasive process, forecasting environmental situations, organizing measures to control invasive species and, ultimately, to ensure environmental and economic security. Information product in the form of a database provides access to the network resource and technologies is a subject of interest to a number of ministries and departments, a wide range of state and commercial structures working in various fields, and also serve as a social advertisement for improving environmental education.
