Understanding the co-evolutionary relationships between Indigenous cultures and non-native species can inform more effective approaches to conservation: the example of pigs (pua'a;
Indigenous resource management (IRM) is dynamic and ever evolving, in part because it is based on co-evolutionary relationships between Indigenous cultures and the biodiversity around them. Forms of conservation imposed on Indigenous people and places by settler-colonialism tend to idealise pre-human and human-excluded environments, leading to conflicts between settler-coloniser conservationists and Indigenous communities detrimental to conservation goals. Conservation efforts that align with IRM and acknowledge the co-evolutionary relationships at the foundation of Indigenous culture can lead to more effective conservation efforts. In Hawai'i, the evolving relationship between Kanaka (Hawaiians) and pua'a (pigs; Sus scrofa) has been the flash point of conflicts between settler-coloniser conservationists and Hawaiian communities. This paper examines the co-evolving relationships between Hawaiians and pigs in an effort to better balance the conservation efforts aimed at controlling invasive species with the State of Hawai'i's obligation to support Indigenous practices and public hunting. We conducted this research by investigating archival Hawaiian language resources, which allowed us to resurrect knowledge lost to time and pinpoint key historical changes over the past 250 years. Our results elucidate this co-evolutionary relationship that shifted from an animal-husbandry relationship to a hunter-prey relationship in the first half of the 19th century. This change in the trajectory of the co-evolutionary relationship was a result of various shifts throughout Hawaiian socio-ecological systems, and therefore necessitates adaptive governance relating to management of and access to pigs. We conclude that Indigenous perspectives offer opportunities to transform conservation biology through multi-objective approaches that address both hunting and conservation goals.
