Plectosporium tabacinum, a Pathogen of the Invasive Aquatic Weed Hydrilla verticillata in Florida
Plectosporium tabacinum, the anamorph of Plectosphaerella cucumerina, was isolated in 1996 from Hydrilla verticillata (hydrilla), an invasive aquatic weed in Florida. P. tabacinum, applied as a suspension of conidia, was pathogenic to hydrilla shoots maintained in aqueous solutions in test tubes. Koch's postulates were fulfilled in several repeated experiments. Infected shoots became slightly chlorotic within 24 h after inoculation. Infected leaves remained intact and were supported by water pressure but collapsed upon removal from water. Histological studies of leaves stained with malachite green and acid fuchsin revealed fungal hyphae within plant cells. The disease developed over a range of temperatures from 15 to 30degC. At 25degC, symptoms were most severe in 5% Hoagland's solution, followed by river water, deionized water, 0.5% Hoagland's, tap water, and spring water. Disease severity increased as inoculum concentration was increased from 105 to 107 conidia ml-1. This is the first report of P. tabacinum as a pathogen of hydrilla, a fully submerged aquatic plant species.
