Sleeping with the enemy: introgressive hybridization in two invasive centrarchids
Introgressive hybridization between Micropterus dolomieu and Micropterus salmoides was assessed in their invaded South African range using nine microsatellite markers and two mtDNA gene regions. Although M. dolomieu and M. salmoides are distantly related, indicated by the large uncorrected pairwise distances observed between the two species, mitochondrial introgression and unidirectional admixture was detected.
