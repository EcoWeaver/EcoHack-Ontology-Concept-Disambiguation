First occurrence of the mysid Hemimysis anomala in an inland lake in North America, Oneida Lake, NY
Hemimysis anomala (Crustacea, Mysidae) is a recent invader to North America that until now was reported only from the Laurentian Great Lakes and their immediate embayments, along with the St. Lawrence River. In August 2009, we identified Hemimysis in diets of white perch and yellow perch in Oneida Lake, NY. Night time vertical plankton net tows detected Hemimysis at four sites across the lake. Hemimysis in fish diets (5.5- 8.6 mm) were larger than in net tows (2.2-7.0 mm) and reproduction is occurring as some females had brood sacs. This is the first documented introduction of Hemimysis to an inland lake in North America, outside the Great Lakes. Oneida Lake is located 53 river km upstream from Lake Ontario, the nearest known source of Hemimysis. No genetic differences were found between Hemimysis in Oneida Lake and Lake Ontario, indicating this is likely the source of introduction. Several large rapids, locks, and dams separate the two lakes, and as a result the most likely vector of introduction to Oneida Lake is pleasure boat or light commercial traffic via the canal system or overland transport. The presence of Hemimysis in Oneida Lake 3 years after it was first found in Lake Ontario suggests this species may spread rapidly throughout the basin. Despite an intensive monitoring program on Oneida Lake directed at fish, Zooplankton, and limnology, Hemimysis was only detected in fish diets and night time Zooplankton tows, indicating it may go undetected in lakes for some time using traditional daytime net tows.
