Differential vulnerability of two sympatric tadpoles to an invasive crayfish predator
Many amphibian population declines have been associated with the introduction of alien aquatic predators. Here, we explore the vulnerability of tadpoles of two sympatric Japanese species [Pelophylax nigromaculatus (PN) and Rhacophorus schlegelii (RS)] to the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii. We first examined the behavioral responses of the tadpoles to the cues of caged, fed crayfish predator in a controlled laboratory experiment, and subsequently tested their survival when together in the presence of free-ranging predator in outdoor mesocosms that simulated natural ponds. Only PN reduced activity level to the cues of the predator, but this apparent behavioral defense recorded in the laboratory did not result into higher survival in outdoor mesocosms. In mesocosms, PN exhibited higher biomass increment but experienced higher mortality in predator environments. The mechanism mediating mortality remains unclear though. These results indicate that sympatric prey may differentially respond and be disproportionally vulnerable to novel predators. Our study illustrates the possible contribution of a life-history trait influencing risk of predation in newly invaded systems.
