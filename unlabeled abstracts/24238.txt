Long-term management of the invasive Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana, 1852) in a small mountain stream
Pacifastacus leniusculus (an invasive species in European water bodies) was detected for the first time in the Andalusia Region (S. Spain) in the year 2000. Since 2005, a continuous control management programme has been carried out by the Environmental Regional Government. Management efforts aimed to reduce the population size, to contain the dispersal and reduce the probability of deliberate translocation into other rivers caused by illegal captures. A combination of techniques was used, including crayfish traps, manual removal from artificial refuges and electrofishing. In the 2005-2009 period, 31 374 specimens were captured. The mean catch rate per worker and day declined from 30.4 +- 3.2 specimens in the first year to 9.8 +- 1.7 in the fourth year, therefore suggesting a sharp decrease in population size. Summer was the period of mating and maximum yields, whereas minimum yields were obtained in Winter, coinciding with egg incubation in burrows. The results obtained and the experience gained will provide essential baseline information for the future management of non-native crayfish in the region.
