Behavioral defense strategies of the stingless bee, Austroplebeia australis, against the small hive beetle, Aethina tumida
Small hive beetle, Aethina tumida Murray, is a parasite of social bee colonies and has become an invasive species, raising concern of the potential threat to native pollinators in its new ranges. Here, we report the defensive behavior strategies used by workers of the Australian stingless bee, Austroplebeia australis Friese, against the small hive beetle. A non-destructive method was used to observe in-hive behavior and interactions between bees and different life stages of small hive beetle (egg, larva, and adult). A number of different individual and group defensive behaviors were recorded. Up to 97% of small hive beetle eggs were destroyed within 90min of introduction, with a significant increase in temporal rate of destruction between the first and subsequent introductions. A similar result was recorded for 3-day-old small hive beetle larvae, with an increased removal rate from 62.5 to 92.5% between the first and second introductions. Of 32 adult beetles introduced directly into the 4 colonies, 59% were ejected, with the remainder being entombed alive in hives within 6h. Efficiency of ejection also significantly increased between the first and third introductions. Our observations suggest that A. australis colonies, despite no previous exposure to this exotic parasite, have well developed hive defences that are likely to minimize entry and survival of small hive beetles.
