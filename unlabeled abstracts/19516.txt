Key factors for biodiversity of surface waters in climate proof cities
Climate change is predicted to cause more extreme rain fall in Europe. In case of insufficient retention capacity of sewers, urban storm water needs to be disconnected from the sewer systems to avoid sewage overflows. Moreover, the storage and discharge capacity of surface water systems in urban areas must be increased to manage larger volumes of storm water and to prevent flooding. Proofing cities for climate change by reconstruction of water systems not only helps to avoid 'wet feet', but also offers promising possibilities to create aquatic habitats, to improve water quality and to optimize biodiversity values of urban areas. For that purpose knowledge is needed on key factors determining the ecological status of urban drainage systems.
