Indigenous strains of Beauveria and Metharizium as potential biological control agents against the invasive hornet Vespa velutina
Alien species often miss parasites in their invaded area, and this is the case in Vespa velutina. This invasive hornet predator of bees was accidentally introduced in Europe from East China in 2004. The control of this species is still problematic, because too costly or dangerous for the applicator. Studying the potential interest of biological control methods may help propose alternatives in V. velutina control. We present here bioassays in which we assessed the potential control efficiency of different French strains of entomopathogenic fungi that we inoculated to adults of V. velutina by different ways being directly, by walking on a contaminated surface, in the food, or by inter-individual transfers. We tested differences between the strains and the application methods using two parameters being lethality and aggressiveness. The direct inoculation method was the most efficient modality, then the contact, transfer and food. Considering all contamination methods, there was no differences in the aggressiveness or lethality between the different strains. Still the aggressiveness was quite short in all strains (average 5.8 +-0.44d), and their efficiency is quite high: we conclude that there is high potential in using such entomopathogens as biological control agent against V. velutina, first at least to replace currently occurring direct chemical treatments, and then potentially to be integrated in futureTrojan horse strategies .
