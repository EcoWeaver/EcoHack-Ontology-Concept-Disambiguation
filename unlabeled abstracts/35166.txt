Biological invasion of the lime leafminer Lithocolletis issikii Kumata (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae): Interaction of the moth with the host plant
Interrelations between the lime leafminer, Lithocolletis issikii Kumata (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae) and the small-leaved linden Tilia cordata Mill. were studied. A significant positive correlation between the number of mines per leaf and the surface areas of individual mines was found. The interaction in the linden-lime leafminer system was found to be active: an increase in the pest density is followed by a significant increase in an individual mine surface area.
