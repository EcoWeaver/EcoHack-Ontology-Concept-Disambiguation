Qualitative study of Mollusca communities in the Serbian Danube stretch (river km 1260-863.4)
First detailed limnological study was performed from April 2003 to June 2008 in a 396.6 km long section of the Serbian Danube (divided in three parts; from 1260 r-km to 863.4 r-km) to examine community composition and spatial distribution of Mollusca with special attention to the expansion of Ponto-Caspian species, propagation of invasive and introduced species and occurrence of endemic species. Mollusca samples were collected at 15 sites in April, June, September and November. We investigated the spatial distributions and calculated the faunistic similarity of localities with respect to the community composition using the Sorensen Quotient of Similarity. Site variation in analyzed qualitative traits was examined using correspondence analysis. Additionally, the obtained Complete Linkage City-block (Manhattan) distances among sites/parts were subjected to UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages) cluster analysis. The class Gastropoda was represented by 18 species from two subclasses (Prosobranchia - six families and Pulmonata - three families).The class Bivalvia was represented by 15 species from four families of order Eulamellibranchiata. Mollusca were represented by 33 species belonging to 17 genera and 13 families. Out of five recorded Ponto-Caspian species in the studied Danube stretch, Lithoglyphus naticoides (Pfeiffer, 1828) and Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771) are assumed to be invasive species with the highest occurrence frequency (F = 1, each). Four new species in invertebrate fauna for the Danube, denoted as the introduced species - Neozoa, were identified: Theodoxus fluviatilis (L., 1758), Corbicula fluminalis (Muller, 1774), C. fluminea (Muller, 1774), and Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834). The only endemic species of Gastropoda found in the Danube was Viviparus acerosus Bourguignat, 1862.
