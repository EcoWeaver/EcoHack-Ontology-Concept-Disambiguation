Effect of Scotch broom, Cytisus scoparius, pod size and patch density on Exapion fuscirostre (Coleoptera, Apionidae) seed weevil oviposition
Cytisus scoparius (L) Link (Fabaceae) is a broom species of European origin introduced both acciden-tally and as an ornamental plant to Australia, New Zealand and America, where it is classified as a noxious invasive species. One of its main seed predators is Exapion (Exapion) fuscirostre (Fabricius), a weevil with a Palearctic distribution and which has been introduced to United States and New Zealand as a biological control agent. Factors influencing the insect's choice of oviposition location are crucial for the plant's reproductive success. We examined E. fuscirostre oviposition on the host plant, C. sco-parius, in the European Mediterranean region. We analysed the effect of pod size, seed abortion rate and host plant patch density on seed infestation rate. Oviposition was greater in patches with low-medium plant densities. Oviposition was also negatively related with seed abortion rate per pod and the rate of infestation by other seed-eating insects. Pod dimensions, particularly width, were positively related with E. fuscirostre oviposition.
