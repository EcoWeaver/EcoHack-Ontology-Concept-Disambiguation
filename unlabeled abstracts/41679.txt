Heavy metals and arsenic phytoremediation potential of invasive alien wetland plants Phragmites karka and Arundo donax: Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) Nexus linked sustainability implications
Heavy metals and arsenic (As) are hazardous to the environment and human health. In concert with the problem of metallic contaminants, certain macrophytes in wetlands are harmful invasive alien plants (IAP). Nevertheless, there exists a knowledge gap, that whether all IAP are nuisance or possess certain beneficial role as bioresource in environmental amelioration. Present study conducted microcosm experiments to investigate the heavy metals and As phytoremediation potential of IAP (Phragmites karka (Retz.) Trin. ex Steud. and Arundo donax L.). The results revealed the significant but differential heavy metals remediation (31.0 to 73.3%; p <= 0.01) and anti-oxidative defence potential (in terms of enzymatic activity) of IAP. Highest translocation factor (TF-0.89) was noted in case of P. karaka for Zn. Rhizofiltration (TF < 1) was observed as main phytoremediation mechanism. In the present experimental design, P. karka was noted as better phytoremediation tool than A. donax. In future studies, phytoremediation potential of these IAP can be tested at field scale, in conjunction with 'Water-energy food (W-E-F) nexus' and 'biorefinery' co-benefits.
