DOES A LARGER CARRYING CAPACITY FOR AN EXOTIC SPECIES ALLOW ENVIRONMENT INVASION? -- SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON THE COMPETITION OF RED AND GREY SQUIRRELS
The conjecture is explored, whether the main reason for an invader to replace antagonistic indigenous populations can be ascribed to the larger carrying capacity of the former. The final outcome of the analysis highlights that this may not always be the case, but anyway to fight an invasion repelling the alien species is a difficult task. Measures aimed at decreasing the grey squirrel reproductive rate might be a viable route, but to find their suitable implementation at affordable costs is far from easy.
