Invertebrate community turnover following control of an invasive weed
Non-native invasive plants are a significant threat to native biodiversity as they change community structure and ecosystem processes and it is becoming imperative that these invasive plants are controlled. We investigated the response of wetland invertebrates to glyphosate chemical control of an introduced tree, grey willow (Salix cinerea), in a before-after-control-impact (BACI) experiment within a New Zealand wetland. Our findings suggest that control of grey willow resulted in significant increases in the abundance of invertebrates within 2 years after herbicide application. Analysis of beetle communities revealed that the abundance and species richness of herbivorous and predacious beetles, the abundance of introduced species, and the species richness of native and introduced species were all significantly higher in the herbicide-treated plots than in the unsprayed plots. The composition of the beetle community separated into two clear groups--plots before spray/no spray and plots 1 and 2 years after herbicide application. We suggest that the beetle compositional changes were driven by complex changes in vegetation associated with the canopy collapse of grey willow trees and the initial influx of introduced plant species, predominantly weedy annuals and perennials, after willow control. Restoration via invasive plant control can promote the reestablishment of invertebrate communities typical of native wetlands, but their long-term sustainability is contingent on prevention of grey willow reinvasion and reestablishment of the native plant habitat.
