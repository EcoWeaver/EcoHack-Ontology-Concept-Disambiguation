Effect of Invasive Weed Biochar Mixed with Inorganic Fertilizer on Soil Physical and Chemical Properties in Semi-arid Region of India
The application of different forms of organic material is a traditional strategy used to sustain soil fertility by replenishing soil organic matter (SOM) and enhancing nutrient profile for crops. This study focuses on the comparative efficacy of biochar prepared from locally available invasive weed biomass (Parthenium hysterophorus L. and Lantana camara L.) with or without inorganic fertilization on soil properties and nutrient availability in post harvested soils. Results revealed that soil bulk density (BD) was significantly decreased with application of biochar @ 5 t ha-1 and 10 t ha-1 along with 75% RDF (Recommended dose of fertilizers) as compared to control while water holding capacity (WHC) significantly increased in the range of 18.40-32.78% as compared to RDF by the application of Parthenium hysterophorus L. and Lantana camara L. biochar @ 2.5 t ha-1, 5.0 t ha-1 and 10.0 t ha-1 along with 75% RDF. It was also observed that Parthenium hysterophorus L. and Lantana camara L. biochar along with 75% RDF addition to soil increased SOC (5.17 g kg-1 to 7.99 g kg-1) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) by 3.36-37.14% as compared with control, depending on the quantity of biochar application. Similar trends were also reported in case of available macro and micro nutrients in the post harvest soil. Therefore, application of invasive weed biochar with inorganic fertilization is considered as promising strategy for improve physical and chemical properties of soils and soil health in semi-arid ecosystem.
