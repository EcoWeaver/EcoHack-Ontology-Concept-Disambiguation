Invasive Tree Species Robinia pseudoacacia: A Potential Biomass Resource in Nagano Prefecture, Japan
The introduced tree species, Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust), has spread extensively in many countries. Because of its active regeneration and rapid initial growth, R. pseudoacacia has not been successfully eradicated despite many efforts. To manage this species, developing information on the growth of R. pseudoacacia as a biomass resource is desirable, and this will motivate logging and could contribute to the extermination or sustainable use of this species. In the present study, the stand volume and growth of R. pseudoacacia forests in riverbeds along the Chikumagawa River in Nagano Prefecture in Japan were examined by tree ring and stem analyses. Seven plots were established in R. pseudoacacia riparian forests of varying ages, and 611 measurements of diameter at breast height and 386 measurements of tree height were made. Stand volumes, which were estimated using equations of stem volume curve based on the results of stem analysis of 47 sample trees, were almost the same as or higher than those of native broadleaf forests in Japan. Stand volumes continued to increase for more than 20 years. Current annual increments of four plots (aged 13-22 years) indicated that it could take R. pseudoacacia forests to reach a maximum level. Growth of R. pseudoacacia was comparable to or faster than native broadleaved species in Japan, showing the possibility of short rotation harvesting.
