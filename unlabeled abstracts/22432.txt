Recent Records of Adalia bipunctata(L.), Coccinella transversoguttata richardsoniBrown, and Coccinella novemnotataHerbst (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) from South Dakota and Nebraska
Adalia bipunctata (L.), Coccinella transversoguttata richardsoni Brown, and C. novemnotata Herbst (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) were previously common throughout much of North America, but their numbers have declined drastically over the last few decades. This paper reports on recent findings of these species at nine sites in western South Dakota and western Nebraska in 2008. Nine A. bipunctata, 11 C. transversoguttata richardsoni, and 12 C. novemnotata were among 930 coccinellids sampled overall. An additional C. transversoguttata richardsoni was among coccinellids captured on a sticky trap in a wheat field during survey for cereal leaf beetle, Oulema melanopus (L.), in Butte, County, South Dakota in 2000. In several instances, adult C. transversoguttata richardsoni and C. novemnotata were observed on plants with other coccinellids, especially Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, a native species, and Coccinella septempunctata L., a non-native species. Coccinella septempunctata was observed feeding upon two native aphids, Aphis helianthi Monell and Uroleucon atripes (Gillette and Palmer), providing additional records of predation by this coccinellid on non-target, native prey. Results are discussed with respect to other recent discoveries of A. bipunctata, C. transversoguttata richardsoni, and C. novemnotata and in relation to future research and conservation efforts.
