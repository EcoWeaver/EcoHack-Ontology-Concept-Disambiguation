Invasion of a South AfricanAnguilla mossambica(Anguillidae) Population by the Alien Gill WormPseudodactylogyrus anguillae(Monogenea)
The parasitic gill monogenean Pseudodactylogyrus anguillae is alien to Africa. In an investigation of 227 longfin eel, Anguilla mossambica, and 26 mottled eel, Anguilla marmorata, sampled from four river systems in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, this parasite was only present on the gills of A. mossambica sampled from the Great Fish River system. In the Great Fish River, it infected 73.2% of the sampled population at a mean intensity of 63.8 +- 34.3 parasites per fish. High prevalence and intensity are indicative of a well-established alien invasive parasitic species. Results showing the absence of P. anguillae from the co-occurring but less abundant A. marmorata indicate that this species may be less susceptible to P. anguillae infection.
