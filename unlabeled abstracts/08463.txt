Mitochondrial genetic variations of an introduced freshwater fish, goldfish Carassius auratus at the frontier between Europe and Asia (western Anatolia, Turkey): proximity to Europe rather than East Asia?
Carassius auratus is one of the most significant ornamental and food fishes of the world that is globally distributed and well known. Although it is known to have existed at least for six decades and expanding its distribution range in Turkish waters, there is a dearth of information on genetic structure and variations of goldfish in Turkey. In this study, four mitochondrial genes (Cytochrome b, cytochrome oxidase II, 12S ribosomal RNA and 16S ribosomal RNA) were used to infer the genetic variations of goldfish populations sampled from western part of Anatolia, Turkey. Three populations were clustered under three haplotypes for each gene and all haplotypes were special. Cytochrome b was found to have more variable sites and higher genetic diversity than other genes. According to the haplotype networks, goldfish populations in Turkey showed high level of mutational processing and originated from the common haplotype known in native East Asian populations of the species. Extensive sampling scheme covering whole Anatolia should provide better understanding on the dispersal pattern of the species.
