Vegetation Management, Stock Type, and Scarification Effects on White Pine Weevil Incidence and Early Norway Spruce Growth in Quebec, Canada
In Canada, Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) is an exotic species mainly used as a fast-growing tree in intensive silviculture. However, this species is sensitive to attacks by white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi Peck [Coleoptera: Curculionidae]) (WPW), a pest that girdles and kills leader shoots, targeting open-growing individuals with fully sunlit terminals. We hypothesized that there is a compromise when releasing planted Norway spruce between growth interference by competing vegetation and avoiding creation of favorable conditions for attacks and growth reduction by WPW. We evaluated the effects of stock type, scarification, and vegetation management on WPW incidence and early Norway spruce growth in southeastern Quebec (Canada). Our study confirmed that after 11 growing seasons, the growth of Norway spruce seedlings was driven by the presence of competing species, a factor that can be managed through vegetation control. Although released seedlings were at a higher risk of WPW attack, the trees were ultimately taller than those growing in control conditions. Although significant in some treatment combinations, stock type effects were limited and marginal compared with vegetation effects. Scarification did not improve seedling establishment on this site characterized by a thin humus layer.
