Invasive Harlequin Ladybird Carries Biological Weapons Against Native Competitors
Surprise Attack Humans conduct the largest ecological experiment ever by continually moving species between continents. For example, the harlequin ladybird beetle, native to Asia, has become highly invasive in many regions after being introduced for biological control, but we do not understand why this species should so readily outcompete native ladybirds. Vilcinskas et al. (p. 862 ; see the Perspective by Reynolds ) show that harlequin beetles have parasitic microsporidia within their hemolymph, which are fatal to other ladybird beetles that prey on harlequin beetle eggs and larvae. Harlequin beetles thus have an innate advantage over species that are otherwise equivalent in their abilities, but this sort of competitive advantage can be hard to spot.
