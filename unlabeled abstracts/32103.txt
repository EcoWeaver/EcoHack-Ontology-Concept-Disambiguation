Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) on an Invasive Edge: Abundance, Spatial Distribution, and Habitat Usage of Larvae and Pupae Across Urban and Socioeconomic Environmental Gradients
The Asian tiger mosquito [Aedes albopictus (Skuse)] is an invasive species of public health importance that is currently expanding its range in the Northeast United States. Effective Ae. albopictus control depends on a thorough understanding of factors influencing their abundance, spatial distribution, and habitat preference. We conducted a series of container surveys for Ae. albopictus larvae/pupae over 2 yr across nine sites in neighborhoods along its invasive range in southern New York. Selected sites represented a gradient of percent impervious surface and median household income. Two hypotheses were tested: 1) Ae. albopictus larval/pupal abundance increases and spatial distribution becomes less clustered as site-level median income decreases and percent impervious surface increases because of increased larval habitat quality and availability; and 2) container-level characteristics are predictive of Ae. albopictus larval/pupal infestation across a range of sites. In 2016, neither median household income nor impervious surface predicted Ae. albopictus abundance. In 2017, sites with greater impervious surface were more heavily infested by some measures. In both years, Ae. albopictus larval/pupal spatial distribution as measured by K-function was more clustered in with greater median household income. Most container characteristics were either not predictive of Ae. albopictus or varied between years. Based on the variability of predictive container characteristics, we conclude that identification of key containers is not useful in this region. However, Ae. albopictus can be nonhomogenously distributed or abundant based on income level and impervious surface. Improved control of immatures should consider these regional predictors of Ae. albopictus populations.
