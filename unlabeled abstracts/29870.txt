Invasive Alien Plants in the Azorean Protected Areas: Invasion Status and Mitigation Actions
This chapter addresses plant invasions in the protected areas of the Azores (Northern Atlantic), whose flora encompasses a considerable proportion of alien species (about 70 %). The chapter includes (i) a general characterization of the Azores, with particular reference to their Island Natural Parks covering 24 % of the inland surface; (ii) an assessment of the plant invasion status of the Island Natural Parks (based on distribution data and expert evaluation of potential impacts and possibility of control of invasive alien plants); and (iii) a report about on-going and recent management initiatives embracing the control of invasive alien plants. The results show that the Island Natural Parks of Santa Maria Island is potentially the most threatened by invasive alien plants, followed in decreasing order by the Island Natural Parks of the islands of Graciosa, Sao Jorge, Corvo, Faial, Sao Miguel, Terceira, Flores and Pico. Some of the most threatening species are highlighted. Due to the innovative assessment methodology, the results do not fully corroborate previous studies, showing that just species listing may not provide a full understanding of the potential effects of invasive alien plants on native biodiversity, thus bringing new insights that may assist management initiatives. Several invasive alien plants management projects run by the Azorean Government and the Portuguese Society for the Study of Birds are described, with reference to those supported by the LIFE programme and PRECEFIAS (an Azorean project devoted to control of invasive alien plants in protected areas). Finally, a holistic discussion is provided stressing strengths and weaknesses of all topics covered in the chapter so that more effective invasive alien plant management strategies can be achieved in the future.
