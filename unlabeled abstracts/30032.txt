The prevalence and benefits of admixture during species invasions: a role for epistasis?
AbstractSpecies introductions often bring together genetically divergent source populations, resulting in genetic admixture. This geographic reshuffling of diversity has the potential to generate favorable new genetic combinations, facilitating the establishment and invasive spread of introduced populations. Observational support for the superior performance of admixed introductions has been mixed, however, and the broad importance of admixture to invasion questioned. Under most underlying mechanisms, admixture's benefits should be expected to increasewith greater divergence among and lower genetic diversity within source populations. We use a literature survey to quantify the prevalence of admixture and evaluate whether it occurrs under circumstances predicted to be mostbeneficial to introduced species. We find that 39% of species are reported to be admixed when introduced. Admixed introductions come from sources with a wide range of genetic variation, but are disproportionately absent where there is high genetic divergence among native populations. We discuss multiple potential explanations for these patterns, but note that negative epistatic interactions should be expected at high divergence amongpopulations (outbreeding depression). As a case study, we experimentally cross source populations differing in divergence in the invasive plantCentaurea solstitialis. We find many positive (heterotic) interactions, but fitness benefits decline and are ultimately negative at high source divergence, with patterns suggestingcyto-nuclear epistasis. We conclude that admixture is common in species introductions and often happens under conditions expected to be beneficial to invaders, but that these conditions may be constrained by predictable negativegenetic interactions, potentially explaining conflicting evidence for admixture's benefits to invasion.
