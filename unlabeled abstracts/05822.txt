The bionomics of an invasive speciesSitona lepidusduring its establishment in New Zealand
AbstractThe egg, larval, pupal and adult abundance of the clover root weevilSitona lepidusGyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was monitored at three sites for the first ten years following the discovery of this exotic pest in the Waikato region of New Zealand. The species went through an initial boom and bust cycle at two sites, with populations reaching up to 1800 larvae m-2. Thereafter, winter larval populations were relatively stable, ranging between 450-750 m-2. Unlike in the Northern Hemisphere,S. lepiduswas found to have two generations a year in the Waikato region of New Zealand. Pasture white clover content at the time of peak adult numbers was positively related to the subsequent peak larval populations for each generation. The factors contributing to the emergence ofS. lepidusas one of the most important pasture pests in New Zealand are discussed.
