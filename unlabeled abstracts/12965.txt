Spread and dispersal of emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae): estimating the spatial dynamics of a difficult-to-detect invasive forest pest
AbstractThe emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is a destructive invasive pest that threatens North American ash (Fraxinus (Oleaceae)) and inflicts substantial aesthetic, ecological, and economic damage in urban forests and rural woodlands. Understanding adult EAB dispersal and spread of infestations is critical to effectively manage and mitigate its potential impact in North America and elsewhere. Challenges of quantifying short-distance and long-distance movement of adult EAB in the field remain exceptionally difficult. Here we review our current understanding of EAB spread. Research to date suggests natural spread of EAB populations is variable and influenced by local environmental conditions, but limited to only a few km per year. In contrast, long-distance spread resulting from anthropogenic movement of infested ash material, such as nursery trees or firewood, can greatly increase local and regional rate of spread through the formation of satellite populations. Key areas in need of future research are highlighted.
