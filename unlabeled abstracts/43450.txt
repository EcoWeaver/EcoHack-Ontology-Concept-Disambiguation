Differentiation of European invasive clams of the genus Corbicula (Cyrenidae) using shell shape analysis
ABSTRACT Here, we investigate the shell shape variation of some closely related freshwater species of the bivalve genus Corbicula using descriptive (qualitative), geometric morphometric and traditional conchometric approaches. The combination of these different approaches allows for an effective discrimination between the species C. fluminalis, C. fluminea and C. leana, as well as an unidentified Corbicula sp. The roundness of the shell hinge is an important diagnostic feature, as are shell sculpture (ribs), symmetry of the apertural margin, and both position and extension of the umbo. We also identify possible hybrids between C. fluminalis and C. leana, with these showing features intermediate to those of the parent species. We examine variability of shell features of C. leana in selected areas in Europe and compare these results with material from the native range of Japan and Korea. For C. leana, we identify two geographic morphotypes from the native area; within Europe, there is a high morphological diversity of this species with several new forms arising, most probably as a result of hybridization.
