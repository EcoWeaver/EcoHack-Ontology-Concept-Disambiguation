A STUDY ON THREE MAJOR FOREST INVASIVE SPECIES COMMON ALONG THE SHIVALIK BELT OF HIMACHAL PRADESH KASHMIR, PUNJAB AND UTTARAKHAND, INDIA
Non-native/distant species that occur outside of their natural existence with good scattering ability are known as forest invasive species (FIS). Some alien species become invasive when they are introduced either purposely or accidentally, to a new environment where they exhibit an ability to conquer and dominatethe native species. There are ample literatures on such species in IHR (Indian Himalayan Region), when compared less is known in the Shivaliks. The present study is an attempt to review on three major FIS of the Shivalik belt of Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir, Punjab and Uttarakhand of North West India. Some of the plants that were intended to be beneficial have developed a notorious habit, as they are known for their adaptability, persistence, reproductive ability and exclusion of competition. It has drastically changed the composition of natural habitats, as well as the variety and dynamics of native flora. These species have become established outside of their native ranges and have learnt to thrive in this new ecological area. But with time, the situation has worsened as a result of a lack of knowledge, inadequate information about the species, its range and a large ecological amplitude.
