Effect of the invasive New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) on the littoral macroinvertebrate community in a temperate mesotrophic lake
The chief aim of the present study was to reveal changes in a littoral macroinvertebrate community induced by the invasion of the New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum). For that purpose, we compared relevant aspects of the lake littoral macroinvertebrate community in pre- and post-invasion periods and determined the trophic position of P. antipodarum in the lake food web by performing the stable isotope-ratio analysis. The analyses performed showed that P. antipodarum is a primary consumer that may utilise a wide range of primary food sources. Overall, our study showed the following effects of the P. antipodarum invasion on the macroinvertebrate community: A definite increase in the total macroinvertebrate biomass, a significant increase in the local macroinvertebrate family richness and diversity, a shift in the community composition from crustacean- to gastropod-dominated. However, P. antipodarum invasion was not found to affect the biomass of local macroinvertebrates, which remained unchanged.
