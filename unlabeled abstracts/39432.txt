Alien vascular flora of Marion and Prince Edward Islands: new species, present distribution and status
The presence and distribution of alien plant species on subantarctic Marion and Prince Edward Islands is reviewed and updated. This study documents the finding of a well established population of Cerastium fontanum on Prince Edward Island. An additional taxa, Senecio sp., is recorded in association with a recurrence of Plantago lanceolata on Marion Island. Propagules of both these taxa have recently been dispersed to the island in building material imported from South Africa. The distribution of Agrostis stolonifera and Sagina apetala on Marion Island has increased markedly between 1981 and 1989.
