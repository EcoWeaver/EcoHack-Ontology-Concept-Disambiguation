Holocene climate variability and environmental history at the Patagonian forest/steppe ecotone: Lago Mosquito (42deg29'37.89''S, 71deg24'14.57''W) and Laguna del Condor (42deg20'47.22''S, 71deg17'07.62''W)
Along the eastern Andes, a sharp ecotone separates steppe from North Patagonian forest dominated by Nothofagus spp. and Austrocedrus chilensis. The longitudinal position of the ecotone is largely determined by effective moisture, which in turn is partly governed by the strength and latitudinal position of the Southern Westerlies. As a result, changes in the ecotone provide an opportunity to examine past climate variations. Holocene environmental history at two sites in close proximity is inferred from pollen and high-resolution charcoal data. Prior to 9000 cal. yr BP, vegetation resembled a steppe, in accordance with widespread aridity. Fires were infrequent, likely as a consequence of fuel discontinuity associated with low vegetation cover. At 9000 cal. yr BP, forest taxa expanded into steppe and fires became frequent, indicating that summers were arid enough to support fires but winter moisture was sufficient for Nothofagus spp. to expand. A two-step increase in effective moisture is inferred for the middle Holocene. The first step occurred at 8500 cal. yr BP, as interpreted from the increase in A. chilensis in the region, probably as a consequence of an eastward migration from glacial refugia. The second step at 5500 cal. yr BP is based on a Nothofagus spp. expansion into the steppe. Steppe readvances into the forest between 5250 and 3000 cal. yr BP indicate decreased temperatures and/or effective moisture. The last 3000 years are characterized by expansions of A. chilensis and an eastward shift of the ecotone, suggesting more humid conditions. European settlement is reflected in the establishment of non-native species and disturbance-adapted taxa.
