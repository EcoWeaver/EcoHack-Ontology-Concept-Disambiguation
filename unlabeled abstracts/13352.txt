Sexual and asexual reproductive strategies of invasive Eurasian milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) in estuarine environments
The proliferation and domination of many of the world's ecosystems by invasive species is thought to have numerous deleterious impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. As a first step toward improving our understanding of factors controlling the reproductive potential of one such species, we report on the impacts of varying salinity on reproductive strategies of Eurasian milfoil, an invasive species of submerged vegetation that has persisted in Gulf of Mexico estuaries for decades. We present results from a series of experiments designed to determine relative incidences of sexual (flowering) and asexual (fragmentation) reproduction at salinities commonly encountered in these estuaries (0, 5, 15 psu). Because fragmentation is thought to be responsible for milfoil spread in freshwaters, we also investigate the effects of salinity on shoot breaking strength and fragment root production. Experimental results indicate that production of fragments and plant breaking strength are not significantly impacted by increased salinity. In contrast, flowering and fragment root production are decreased at elevated salinities. These results suggest that milfoil's invasiveness may be diminished in brackish water. As such, the removal of impediments to brackish water intrusion may aid in reducing milfoil's proliferation via disruption of physiological processes such flowering and fragment root generation.
