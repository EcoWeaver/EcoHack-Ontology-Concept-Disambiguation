Potential predators of an invasive frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui) in Hawaiian forests
In Hawaii, where there are no native reptiles or amphibians, 27 species of reptiles and amphibians have established (Kraus 2003); however, few have been studied to determine their ecological impacts. For example, little is known about the impacts of the Puerto Rican frog, Eleutherodactylus coqui Thomas, that recently invaded (late 1980s) (Kraus et al. 1999), and has established on all four main Hawaiian Islands (Kraus & Campbell 2002). However, there are likely to be consequences because E. coqui can attain high densities (20 570 frogs ha-1 on average in Puerto Rico) and consume large quantities of invertebrates (114 000 prey items ha-1 per night on average in Puerto Rico) (Stewart & Woolbright 1996).
