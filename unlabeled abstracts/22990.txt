Preliminary assessment of feral goldfish impacts on ponds, with particular reference to native crucian carp
Introductions of an Asian cyprinid, goldfish Carassius auratus, are known to pose a genetic threat to crucian carp Carassius carassius, which is native to northern parts of central and western Europe, including southeast England. However, there are no known studies in Europe of goldfish impacts on crucian carp growth and life-history traits, nor on the recipient ecosystems. The present study is the first such attempt, and compares the plants, invertebrates and fish biology (growth, condition, reproduction) in six ponds, two containing crucian carp only (allopatry), two containing goldfish only (allopatry), and two with both species (sympatry). Feral goldfish growth was greatest in sympatry with native crucian carp, whereas crucian carp growth was similar regardless of goldfish presence or absence. However, body condition (LK) and relative fecundity (per unit of body weight) of crucian carp was greatest in sympatry with feral goldfish. LK increased significantly with increasing water conductivity in goldfish but not in crucian carp, and LK was not related to pond invertebrate densities in either fish species. Differences in the plant and aquatic invertebrate communities observed in the study ponds could not be attributed to the introduction and establishment of goldfish, however non-native plant and invertebrate species were observed only in ponds containing goldfish. Differences in growth and condition between the two Carassius species does not appear to be due to differences in available food, so elevated somatic growth and reproductive output in crucian carp and faster growth in goldfish in sympatry may be due to non-dietary competitive interactions. The present preliminary study highlights the difficulties of assessing 'real world' impacts of non-native species on native species and ecosystems as well as the need for further study of feral goldfish impacts on European pond ecosystems in general and on native congener crucian carp in particular.
