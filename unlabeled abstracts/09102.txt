Effects of Posidonia oceanica canopy on Caulerpa taxifolia size in a north-western Mediterranean bay
Caulerpa taxifolia (Vahl) C. Agardh is a green tropical seaweed recently introduced in the Mediterranean. Since 1984, when for the first time it was recorded along the French Riviera, it has rapidly spread into a wide range of sublittoral habitats and has contributed to the decay and regression of the seagrasses Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Ascherson and Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile. Descriptive field studies have indicated a strong habitat effect on C. taxifolia performance and suggested a positive influence of seagrasses, particularly of P. oceanica, on both blade density and size of the alga.
