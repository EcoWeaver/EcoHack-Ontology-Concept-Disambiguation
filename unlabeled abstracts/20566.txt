Registration of a Hard Red Winter Wheat Genetic Stock Homozygous for for Facilitating Alien Introgression for Crop Improvement
Wild relatives of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are important sources of disease and pest resistance that can be exploited in wheat improvement. However, in wheat-alien species hybrids the pairing homeologous gene, Ph1, suppresses the pairing and recombination of wheat and alien chromosomes and no alien genetic transfer can occur. However, in plants nullisomic for the Ph1 gene, and in ph1b mutant stocks, having a large deletion at the Ph1 locus, homeologous wheat and alien chromosomes can pair and recombine. The original ph1b mutant stock is in Chinese Spring background, which has poor agronomic characteristics, and several backcrosses with adapted wheat cultivars are necessary before the agronomic performance of recombinants can be evaluated. The present report describes the transfer and characterization of the ph1b mutant allele into an adapted Kansas winter wheat, which was released as KS12WGGRC55 (TA5092) (Reg. No. GS-170, PI 663870), which will accelerate the evaluation and utilization of wheat alien recombinants in cultivar improvement.
