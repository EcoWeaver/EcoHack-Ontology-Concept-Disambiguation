Impacts of the emerald ash borer (EAB) eradication and tree mortality: potential for a secondary spread of invasive plant species
Since the discovery of the emerald ash borer in 2002, eradication efforts have been implemented in an attempt to eliminate or contain the spread of this invasive beetle. The eradication protocol called for the removal of every ash tree within a 0.8km radius around an infested tree. In 2005 this study was established to identify environmental changes attributed to the eradication program and measure subsequent shifts in forest community composition and structure. We conducted this study in Ohio and compared areas that received the eradication treatment (ash trees cut down), to areas that were left uncut, (ash still standing). The goal of this project was to identify how the plant community is responding in these two areas. The eradication protocol accelerated the formation and size of gaps within the forest and thus increased the duration and intensity of light penetrating through to the forest floor. In addition, the use of track vehicles for removal of cut trees resulted in significant soil compaction. The resultant plant community had greater species diversity (H'). When specific species composition differences were compared, an increase in the establishment of invasive plant species was detected in areas that received eradication efforts compared to those that did not. Invasive species accounted for 18.7% of the total herbaceous cover in this highly disturbed environment which included Cirsium arvense, Rhamnus cathartica and 2 species of Lonicera. In contrast, invasive species accounted for<1% of the total herbaceous cover in the undisturbed uncut areas.
