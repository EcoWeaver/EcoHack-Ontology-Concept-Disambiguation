Genetic structure and dispersal patterns of the invasive psocidLiposcelis decolor(Pearman) in Australian grain storage systems
AbstractMicrosatellite markers were used to investigate the genetic structure among invasiveL. decolorpopulations from Australia and a single international population from Kansas, USA to determine patterns of dispersal. Six variable microsatellites displayed an average of 2.5-4.2 alleles per locus per population. Observed (HO) heterozygosity ranged from 0.12-0.65 per locus within populations; but, in 13 of 36 tests, HOwas less than expected. Despite low levels of allelic diversity, genetic structure estimated as th was significant for all pairwise comparisons between populations (th=0.05-0.23). Due to suspected null alleles at four loci,ENA(excluding null alleles) correctedFSTestimates were calculated overall and for pairwise population comparisons. TheENA-correctedFSTvalues (0.02-0.10) revealed significant overall genetic structure, but none of the pairwise values were significantly different from zero. A Mantel test of isolation by distance indicated no relationship between genetic structure and geographic distance among all populations (r2=0.12,P=0.18) and for Australian populations only (r2=0.19,P=0.44), suggesting that IBD does not describe the pattern of gene flow among populations. This study supports a hypothesis of long distance dispersal byL. decolorat moderate to potentially high levels.
