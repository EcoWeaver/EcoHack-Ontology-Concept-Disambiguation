The invasive plant data landscape: a synthesis of spatial data and applications for research and management in the United States
Context An increase in the number and availability of datasets cataloging invasive plant distributions offers opportunities to expand our understanding, monitoring, and management of invasives across spatial scales. These datasets, created using on-the-ground observations and modeling techniques, are made both for and by researchers and managers. Objectives The large number and variety of data types and associated datasets can be difficult to navigate, require high levels of data literacy, and can overwhelm the intended end-users. By providing a synthesis of available data types and datasets, this work may facilitate data understanding and use among researchers and managers. Methods We synthesize types of invasive plant distribution data sources, highlighting publicly available datasets and their potential applications and limitations for research and management. Results Eight data types and their potential applications for research and management are described. We also describe gaps in current invasive species distribution data usability and outline a path forward for improving the use of invasive plant data in future research and management. Conclusions Accessible and usable invasive plant spatial data are needed for developing landscape scale analysis and management plans. By synthesizing the invasive plant data available, with examples and limitations for application, this work will serve as a guide to facilitate appropriate and efficient data choices in current and future research and management.
