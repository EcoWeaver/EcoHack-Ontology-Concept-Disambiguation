New Zealand grasslands revisited: identification ofCocksfoot mild mosaic virus
In the springs of 2003 and 2004, Bromus diandrus plants showing conspicuous mosaic symptoms were observed at Waitati, East Otago, New Zealand. Electron microscopic examination of sap samples in 2% phosphotungstate (pH 6.5) revealed large numbers of isometric particles 25 nm in diameter. The virus was mechanically transmitted to Setaria italica and Secale cereale cvv. Amilo and Rahu but not to Avena sativa, Chenopodium spp., Hordeum vulgare, Nicotiana benthamiana, Triticum aestivum or Zea spp. In Ouchterlony double diffusion tests, sap from infected plants and purified particles reacted strongly with antisera to Cocksfoot mild mosaic virus (CMMV and CMMV-Phleum mottle).Weaker reactions were observed with an antiserum to Panicum mosaic virus and there were no reactions with antisera to eight other sobemoviruses and ten other viruses known to infect the Poaceae. ELISA was used to test archived and fresh samples for CMMV and other viruses known to infect the Poaceae. CMMV was detected in B. diandrus and Ryegrass mosaic virus was detected in Holcus lanatus and Lolium perenne. However, Brome mosaic virus, Brome streak virus, Soilborne wheat mosaic virus, Wheat dwarf virus and Wheat streak mosaic virus were not detected in samples collected between 1995-2005 from Auckland and the South Island of New Zealand. This is the first report of CMMV in the Southern Hemisphere.
