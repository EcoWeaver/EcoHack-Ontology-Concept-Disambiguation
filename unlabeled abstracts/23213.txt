Round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) population structure, biomass, prey consumption and mortality from predation in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario
We compared round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) population structure and biomass, estimated the quantity of prey consumed by round goby and assessed predation on round goby in two areas of the Bay of Quinte (upper and lower bay) that were invaded by this species two years apart. A bioenergetics approach was used to estimate round goby consumption and to illustrate the influence of changes in the round goby biomass, from May to October in both areas of the bay. Mean round goby biomass was 5 tonnes/km2 for the upper bay and 11.2 tonnes/km2 for the lower bay. Round goby populations were dominated by age-0 to age-2 individuals; older individuals were rare although they constituted a greater portion of total biomass in the earlier invaded lower bay than the upper bay. Estimated round goby consumption was 78.4 tonnes/km2 for the upper bay and 127.1 tonnes/km2 for the lower bay; dreissenids were the most important prey followed by chironomids, Zooplankton and amphipods. Diet analysis showed that round gobies were consumed by all predator species analyzed, and constituted a high percentage of stomach content biomass in yellow perch (Perca flavescens), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and northern pike (Esox lucius). Age structure differences between the upper and lower bay are consistent with those expected between expanding and stable populations.
