Object-based classification of Worldview-2 imagery for mapping invasive common reed,Phragmites australis
Wetlands provide many environmental and societal benefits. Unfortunately, the importance of wetlands has only recently been acknowledged after centuries of drainage and conversion to other land uses. An emerging threat to North American wetlands is the introduction of invasive plant species such as Phragmites australis, a reed introduced from Europe. Previous high spatial resolution satellite imagery used for mapping Phragmites was limited spectrally to four bands (blue, green, red, and near-infrared). A recently launched satellite, Worldview-2, has four additional spectral bands that may allow for more accurate mapping of Phragmites. In this study, a single-date Worldview-2 image was used to map wetland vegetation at Walpole Island, Canada. Object-based and per-pixel maximum likelihood classifications were performed on a four-band subset simulating traditional multispectral imagery and the full eight-band set of Worldview-2. The overall classification accuracy of 94.0% achieved for the eight-band object-based method was the highest of the four classifications methods used. The accuracy achieved by the eight-band object-based classification shows that single-date Worldview-2 image is promising for distinguishing Phragmites from native wetland plant species late in the growing season in coastal Great Lakes wetlands.
