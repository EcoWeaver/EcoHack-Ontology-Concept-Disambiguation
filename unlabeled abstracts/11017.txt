Exotic Plant Species as Problems and Solutions in Ecological Restoration: A Synthesis
Exotic species have become increasingly significant management problems in parks and reserves and fre-quently complicate restoration projects. At the same time there may be circumstances in which their re-moval may have unforeseen negative consequences or their use in restoration is desirable. We review the types of effects exotic species may have that are im-portant during restoration and suggest research that could increase our ability to set realistic management goals. Their control and use may be controversial; therefore we advocate consideration of exotic species in the greater context of community structure and suc-cession and emphasize areas where ecological re-search could bring insight to management dilemmas surrounding exotic species and restoration. For exam-ple, an understanding of the potential transience of exotics in a site and the role particular exotics might play in changing processes that influence the course of succession is essential to setting removal priorities and realistic management goals. Likewise, a greater understanding of the ecological role of introduced species might help to reduce controversy surrounding their purposeful use in restoration. Here we link gen-eralizations emerging from the invasion ecology liter-ature with practical restoration concerns, including circumstances when it is practical to use exotic species in restoration.
