Multi-scale assessment of invasive plant species diversity using Pleiades 1A, RapidEye and Landsat-8 data
We used a full remote sensing-based approach to assess plant species diversity in large and inaccessible areas affected by Lantana camara L., a common invasive species within the deciduous forests of Western Himalayan region of India, using spectral heterogeneity information extracted from optical data. The spread of L. camara was precisely mapped by Pleiades 1A data, followed by comparing Pleiades 1A, RapidEye and Landsat-8 OLI - assessed plant species diversities in invaded areas. The single plant species analysis was improved by Pleiades 1A-based diversity analysis, and higher species diversity values were observed for mixed vegetation cover. Furthermore, lower Coefficient of Variation and Renyi diversity values were observed where L. camara was the only species, while higher variations were observed in areas with a mixed spectral reflectance. This study was concluded to add a crucial baseline to the previous studies on remote sensing-based solutions for rapid estimation of biodiversity attributes.
