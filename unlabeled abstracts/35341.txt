Evaluating methods to detect and monitor populations of a large invasive lizard: the Argentine giant tegu
The Argentine giant tegu, a large lizard native to South America, was first discovered as established in the USA in scrub habitats of west-central Florida in 2006. Invasive populations potentially could occupy an extensive range of habitats and in much of the southern United States and Mexico and threaten many native species. The Argentine giant tegu was recently deemed as having a "highest impact concern" among the invasive reptile species most threatening to Florida ecology. Among the most rewarding research directions identified for this species was "having a reliable and practical method to detect/monitor" them. We address this need by evaluating five methods for monitoring Argentine giant tegus on how well each method detected the species and whether the observations were sufficient to quantitatively assess population abundance using a widely applicable framework for indexing animal populations. Passive tracking plots were the most efficient and effective means for detecting tegus and calculating abundance indices but were best suited for late winter to spring before summer rains compacted tracking substrates. Gopher tortoise burrows are often used by tegus and camera traps on their entrances proved able to obtain data suitable for indexing populations but required more labor and expense than tracking plots. Trapping either at gopher tortoise burrows or along drift fences was ineffective at capturing tegus. Similarly, visual encounter transects were not effective for observing tegus.
