Genetic Evidence for Multiple Invasions of Coptotermes formosanus (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) in California
Abstract New infestations of the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), were discovered in southern California, namely in Rancho Santa Fe and La Mesa (San Diego County) and Highland Park (Los Angeles County) in 2021. We investigated whether these new infestations were related to the previous infestations in La Mesa (2018) and Canyon Lake, Riverside County (2020). We used two mitochondrial genes (COI and COII) and seven polymorphic microsatellite markers to infer the genetic relationship between southern California colonies and their breeding systems. The samples collected from seven localities belonged to five colonies (inter-colony distances ranged from ~160 m to 185 km, with an average of 97 km). Of these five colonies, two were simple families, and three were extended families. Structure analyses of microsatellite genotypes grouped the termite samples into three distinct genetic clusters, suggesting at least three independent introduction events in southern California.
