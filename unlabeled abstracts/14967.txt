Extinction and invasion do not add up in noisy dynamic ecological networks
Species extinction and invasion concurrently affect the composition and properties of ecological communities, yet their effects have largely been studied separately, and with more focus on species and ecological functional groups than the whole-community level. We adopted a dynamic ecological network approach to compare the effects of simultaneous single-species primary extinction and invasion on a set of ecosystem metrics to the effects of extinction and invasion in isolation. We also investigated the relationship between the impact and reversibility of extinction or invasion through reintroduction or eradication, respectively. We used Monte Carlo simulations of bioenergetic ecological network models that combined trophic and mutualistic interactions, contained either prey-dependent or ratio-dependent trophic functional responses, and incorporated either white or pink environmental stochasticity. As the separate extinction or invasion impact increased, the simultaneous extinction-invasion impact increased but was decreasingly additive of the two separate impacts, across all ecosystem metrics. Greater extinction or invasion impact was associated with lower reversibility for most model types and ecosystem metrics. There were also systematic differences between models with prey- and ratio-dependent functional responses. These results highlight the importance of considering the combined effects of extinction and invasion in ecological studies, management and restoration.
