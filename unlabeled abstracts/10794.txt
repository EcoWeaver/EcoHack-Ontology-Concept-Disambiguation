Chymomyza procnemoides Wheeler (Diptera: Drosophilidae): Will it Succeed as a Biological Invader?
A single male Chymomyza procnemoides, Wheeler, a drosophilid fly native to North America was captured in a forest near Budapest, Hungary in 1990 (Papp, 1992). It was among a group of four other Chymomyza Czerny species, including a second Nearctic Chymomyza species, C. amoena (Loew). Chymomyza amoena was first reported in Europe in 1975 and has spread rapidly. The ecology and behaviour of these two Nearctic species are compared to assess the probability that C. procnemoides will become established and expand its range in the Old World.
