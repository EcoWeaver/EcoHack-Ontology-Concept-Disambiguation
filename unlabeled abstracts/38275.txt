First incidence of the invasive fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith, 1797) attacking maize in Malaysia
The impact of invasive species attacking economically important crops is often unpredictable, which is why information needs to be provided at the earliest stage of the attack. This is an incidence report of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a new invasive species attacking maize in Malaysia. We found this devastating insect feeding on maize in Changlun, a district in the state of Kedah in northern Malaysia. Morphological examination on the collected specimens and plant damage symptoms due to larval feeding allowed us to confirm the presence of the pest. Hence, we confirm the presence of S. frugiperda in yet another country of South East Asia.
