Distribution and Abundance of the Invasive Plant Species Chromolaena odorata L. in the Zamboanga Peninsula, Philippines
The ecology of the highly invasive plant species C. odorata is poorly studied in the Philippines in spite of the fact that it is hard to eradicate, a nuisance in plantations, and known to harm domesticated animals and decimate native plant species. In order to determine the distribution of the species and local ecological factors, we estimated in 75 transect lines the percentage cover of C. odorata and other plant species growing around it, and concurrently determined soil parameters (soil type, pH, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, and % organic matter) in three Provinces of the Zamboanga Peninsula, Southern Philippines. Multivariate Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) revealed no significant relationship between soil parameters and the abundance of C. odorata suggesting eurytopy to edaphic conditions. Peak abundance of C. odorata was associated with reduced abundance of native plant species, but coconut, banana, mango and tree plantation environments appeared to promote growth and the competitive edge of C. odorata. This study demonstrates that through a multivariate approach we were able to discern that C. odorata is a highly adaptable species that pose a threat to native plant biodiversity, and that its distribution and spread seem to be supported by plant monoculture systems.
