Mediterranean Pines as Invasive Species in the Southern Hemisphere
This chapter reviews the increasing importance of Mediterranean pines as invasive non-native species outside the natural range of the genus, especially in temperate parts of the Southern Hemisphere where several species are important weeds. It first discusses human-mediated changes to the ranges of Mediterranean pines and their colonization and persistence ability within and immediately adjoining their natural ranges. Next, it reviews the history of plantings and emergence of invasions of these pines in the Southern Hemisphere. Aspects of the ecology of the most widespread invaders (P. halepensis and P. pinaster) are discussed by considering the factors that influence invasive success. The impacts of the invasive pines are discussed, and management approaches and challenges are reviewed.
