Geostatistical analysis of the distribution ofLeptosphaeriaspecies causing phoma stem canker on winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in England
In June/July 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2006, regional variation in distribution of the pathogens Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa that are causally associated with phoma stem canker was surveyed on winter oilseed rape crops in England. In 2001-2003, when isolates from basal cankers were visually identified as L. maculans or L. biglobosa based on cultural morphological characteristics, 70% were L. maculans and 30%L. biglobosa. In 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2006, when amounts of DNA of each species in basal cankers were determined by quantitative PCR, the abundance of L. maculans DNA was greater than that of L. biglobosa DNA in 77% of samples. When regional differences in amounts of L. maculans and L. biglobosa DNA were mapped geostatistically, quantities of L. maculans DNA were greater in cankers from southern England and those of L. biglobosa DNA were greater in northern England. A comparison with geostatistically mapped predictions made using a weather-based model describing stages in development of phoma stem canker epidemics suggested that these differences in Leptosphaeria populations may have been a consequence of differences in temperature after onset of leaf spotting between northern and southern England. Both PCR and morphological evidence suggested that the abundance of L. maculans in England has increased since the last surveys in the 1980s. Implications of these surveys for control of phoma stem canker are discussed.
