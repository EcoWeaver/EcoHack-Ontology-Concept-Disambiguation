Effects of nonnative invertebrates on two life stages of the native eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica
Since their recent introductions into Florida waters, three sessile invertebrates [Perna viridis (Asian green mussel), Mytella charruana (charru mussel) and Megabalanus coccopoma (pink titan acorn barnacle)] have expanded their range along the Atlantic coast in estuarine waters. Little research has been done to understand how these nonnative species interact with the ecologically and economically important eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. To assess the potential effects of P. viridis, M. charruana and M. coccopoma on C. virginica, the following questions were addressed in manipulative experiments. (1) Does the presence of nonnative species decrease oyster larval settlement? (2) Do oyster larvae avoid settling on nonnative species? (3) Do nonnative species decrease survival of juvenile oysters (spat)? (4) Do nonnative species hinder spat growth? We included two controls: absence of nonnative species and presence of the native mussel Geukensia demissa. The nonnative species influenced settlement, growth and survival of C. virginica in different ways. M. coccopoma and P. viridis negatively influenced larval settlement, whereas M. charruana had no influence on the total number of settled larvae. Oyster larvae avoided settling on all three nonnative species and the native G. demissa. Both nonnative mussels negatively affected survival of juvenile oysters but only M. charruana also reduced spat growth. The native mussel, G. demissa, had no negative impacts on total settlement, survival and growth of C. virginica; in fact, it increased larval settlement in some trials. These three nonnative species should be classified as invasive because all had negative effects on native C. virginica.
