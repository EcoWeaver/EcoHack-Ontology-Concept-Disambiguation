A potential native natural enemy of invasive aquatic weed - water hyacinth
A potential native natural enemy of invasive aquatic weed water hyacinth was found in Shanghai of China: Chironomus larva. The larva can dig into the bulbiform petiole of water hyacinth, the petiole will be broken and decomposed soon, and also, the canker of water hyacinth will fall off. So this larva will be a native natural enemy of water hyacinth for controlling its invasion. From other side, water hyacinth will be gradually naturalized to a component of native ecosystem, although it maybe needs a long time.
