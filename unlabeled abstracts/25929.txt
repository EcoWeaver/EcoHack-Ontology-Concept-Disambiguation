Prediction of stand quality characteristics in sweet chestnut forests in NW Spain by combining terrain attributes, spectral textural features and landscape metrics
Chestnut woods are outstanding elements of European cultural landscapes, and are also recognised as habitats of interest in the Natura 2000 European network of protected areas. Despite their importance, they are threatened by land abandonment and recent rural landscape changes. The loss of Castanea sativa cover and its dominance as a characteristic species may indicate forest degradation, which can occur as a result of natural succession dynamics or invasion by alien species. In this study we aimed to model the conservation status of chestnut stands in the NW Iberian peninsula in terms of their environmental and cultural value, formulated as a quality index that considers the maturity and purity of forest stands. We used features available at wide geographic scales as potential predictors, namely topographic parameters derived from Digital Elevation Models, land-cover heterogeneity determined by means of satellite image texture and landscape metrics. According to the results, altitude emerged as a major factor determining chestnut stand quality, marking a clear difference between highland and lowland environments. The combination of terrain, texture and patch shape refined the classification of each of these scenarios. We discuss the significance of these predictors as environmental controls and indicators of anthropogenic effects.
