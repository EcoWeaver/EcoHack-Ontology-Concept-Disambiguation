Invasion Ecology: An International Perspective Centered in the Holarctic
The Fourth International Symposium on "Alien Species in the Holarctic" was convened September 22-28, 2013, by the Russian Academy of Sciences at the I.D. Papanin Institute for the Biology of Inland Waters (IBIW) on the Volga River in Borok (~355 km north of Moscow). The Organizing Committee spanned five countries (France, People's Republic of China, Poland, Russian Federation, and the United States), with participants (n=150) across the breadth and depth of the Russian Federation, from countries in proximity to it (i.e., Armenia, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine, Siberia, and The Republic of China), and more globally from the United States to Tasmania and Norway to South Africa. This report provides a synopsis of invasive species issues that were discussed at the symposium and, as such, provides an international window for the evaluation of fisheries-related topics in this part of the globe.
