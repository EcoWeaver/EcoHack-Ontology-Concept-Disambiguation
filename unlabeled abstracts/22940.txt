What is in a name? That which we callCecropia peltataby any other name would be as invasive?+
The recent opinion piece by Sheil and Padmanaba (201133. Sheil , D and Padmanaba , M. 2011. Innocent invaders? A preliminary assessment of Cecropia, an American tree, in Java. Plant Ecology & Diversity, 4: 231-240. View all references) argues that greater attention is required for invasive species management procedures that are relevant to and realistic for developing countries. They use the example of the Neotropical tree Cecropia as an introduction to West Java to illustrate their point. In our invited response we contend that the assumptions and data on the dynamics of Cecropia in Java presented in their paper, as well as their review of global Cecropia introductions, are of reduced scientific value. Even so, we agree with the paper's opinion that the naturalised species of Cecropia in West Java represent a considerable invasion risk and that funding must be improved so that the capacity for invasion ecology research and management of invasive alien species in developing countries is more effective. Unlike Sheil and Padmanaba (201133. Sheil , D and Padmanaba , M. 2011. Innocent invaders? A preliminary assessment of Cecropia, an American tree, in Java. Plant Ecology & Diversity, 4: 231-240. View all references), however, we conclude that there is already enough evidence to be concerned by the threat of Cecropia to natural ecosystems, but that knowledge of the relevant taxa is currently insufficient to recommend the most appropriate control options not only for Java, but also for other Cecropia introductions elsewhere in the world.
