The Stefan problem for the Fisher-KPP equation
We study the Fisher-KPP equation with a free boundary governed by a one-phase Stefan condition. Such a problem arises in the modeling of the propagation of a new or invasive species, with the free boundary representing the propagation front. In one space dimension this problem was investigated in Du and Lin (2010) [11], and the radially symmetric case in higher space dimensions was studied in Du and Guo (2011) [10]. In both cases a spreading-vanishing dichotomy was established, namely the species either successfully spreads to all the new environment and stabilizes at a positive equilibrium state, or fails to establish and dies out in the long run; moreover, in the case of spreading, the asymptotic spreading speed was determined. In this paper, we consider the non-radially symmetric case. In such a situation, similar to the classical Stefan problem, smooth solutions need not exist even if the initial data are smooth. We thus introduce and study the "weak solution" for a class of free boundary problems that include the Fisher-KPP as a special case. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution, and through suitable comparison arguments, we extend some of the results obtained earlier in Du and Lin (2010) [11] and Du and Guo (2011) [10] to this general case. We also show that the classical Aronson-Weinberger result on the spreading speed obtained through the traveling wave solution approach is a limiting case of our free boundary problem here.
