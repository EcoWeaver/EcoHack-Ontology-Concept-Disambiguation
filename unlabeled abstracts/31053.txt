First record of the invasive red alga Heterosiphonia japonica (Ceramiales, Rhodophyta) in Canada
Four specimens of the invasive red alga Heterosiphonia japonica were collected from Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada, in August 2012. The identity of these specimens was confirmed using molecular and anatomical evidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of H. japonica in Canada - an invasive red alga that has been advancing along the northeastern coast of North America since its recent introduction to Rhode Island circa 2007.
