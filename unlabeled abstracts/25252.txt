High mitochondrial DNA diversity of an introduced alien carnivore: comparison of feral and ranch American mink Neovison vison in Poland
Aim Invasive alien species usually exhibit very high adaptation and rapid evolution in a new environment, but they often have low levels of genetic diversity (invasive species paradox). Genetic variation and population genetic structure of feral American mink, Neovison vison, in Poland was investigated to explain the invasion paradox and to assess current gene flow. Furthermore, the influence of mink farming on adaptation of the feral population was evaluated by comparing the genetic structure of feral and ranch mink.
