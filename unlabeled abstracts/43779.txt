Verbena brasiliensis Vell.: a new record of an invasive alien species in the flora of Turkey
Verbena brasiliensis, the Brazilian Vervain, is a flowering plant species from Verbenaceae family. It is native to parts of South America, but has spread its range in recent times. During floristic surveys in Bartin province in northern Turkey, a new alien species for the country (Verbena brasiliensis, Verbenaceae) was found. Only two Verbena species were previously known from Turkey. We present an identification key and description of morphological characters of the species, as well as notes regarding the habitat where it was found.
