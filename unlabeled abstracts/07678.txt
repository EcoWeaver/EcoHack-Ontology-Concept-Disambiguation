Exotic stock of Trypanosoma cruzi (Schizotrypanum) capable of development in and transmission by Triatoma protracta protracta from California: public health implications.
A stock of Trypanosoma cruzi was recovered from a Triatoma dimidiata from Tegucigalpa, Honduras. This stock was shown to be capable of development and transmission by native California Triatoma protracta protracta. Isozyme analysis indicated that this T. cruzi is closely related to the Tehuantepec strain and to a lesser extent the Miles' zymodeme 1 strain. The potential public health significance of development and transmission of exotic stocks of T. cruzi by native reduviids is discussed.
