Seasonal priority effects: Implications for invasion and restoration in California coastal sage scrub
AbstractCompetition from exotic annual grasses (EAGs) threatens native plant communities in California. Coastal sage scrub communities have substantially diminished in area over the last century, in some instances by greater than 90%, while EAGs continue to proliferate. Several mechanisms may explain the success of EAGs, including the suppression of native seedlings by accumulated litter, exhaustion of soil moisture, and low seed production or dispersal of natives.The timing and magnitude of rainfall plays a significant role in determining the survival and reproduction of plant species in Mediterranean ecosystems. Populations of annuals fluctuate greatly from year to year, corresponding with variability in autumn precipitation. EAGs in California germinate quickly following small threshold rain events, whereas native species have more complex germination cues, such that exotic annual grasses become active earlier in the growing season. In this way, EAGs may exhibit a priority effect over native plant species with respect to establishment; however, they may have reduced success if their germination is induced at a time followed by a substantial drought (for instance, in the summer) so that they will not persist.The goal of this investigation is 1) to evaluate whether seasonal priority effects contribute to community-level patterns of abundance, and 2) whether late summer watering could be a feasible restoration technique for suppression of exotic annual grasses and weeds in Mediterranean ecosystems.
