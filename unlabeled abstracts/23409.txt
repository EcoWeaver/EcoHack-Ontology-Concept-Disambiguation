Spatial structure and temporal patterns in a large marine ecosystem: Exploited reef fishes of the southeast United States
a b s t r a c t The continental shelf of the southeast United States forms one of North America's Large Marine Ecosys-tems (LME). Despite increased attention on ecosystem management, fisheries within this LME continue to be managed on a single stock basis, in part because interactions among species and environmental effects are poorly understood. Using fishery data from two different sources (recreational and commercial), we applied multivariate statistical techniques to elucidate spatial and temporal dynamics of reef fish assem-blages. Spatial analyses of species composition revealed a zoogeographic boundary near Cape Canaveral, Florida, suggesting that management of reef fishes could be applied to the northern and southern regions with discrimination. Temporal analyses revealed, in general, gradual changes in species composition of landings, but with primary shifts in 1992 and again in 1999-2000. Chronological patterns, evident in these two independent data sets, bear the signature of one or more trending factors, which in this LME could include increased exploitation, spread of invasive species, habitat degradation, or climate change.
