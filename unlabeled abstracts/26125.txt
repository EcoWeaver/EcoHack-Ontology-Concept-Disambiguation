Dispersal and association of two alien species in the Indonesian coral reefs: the octocoral Carijoa riisei and the demosponge Desmapsamma anchorata
The discovery of the association between the sponge Desmapsamma anchorata (Demospongiae: Poecilosclerida: Desmacididae) and the octocoral Carijoa riisei (Cnidaria: Alcyonacea: Clavularidae) on an Indonesian reef enlarges the widespread dispersion of these Atlantic species in the Indo-Pacific area. The species involved and their morphological adaptations resulting from the association are described. When covered by the sponge, C. riisei develops an irregular branching pattern and a dense nematocyst layer where the ectoderm comes in contact with the sponge tissue. The finding of fertile colonies suggests that the Indonesian population of C. riisei is self-sustaining.
