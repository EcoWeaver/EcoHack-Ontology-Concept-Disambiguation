Invertebrate fauna of boneseed, Chrysanthemoides moniliferassp.monilifera (L.) T. Norl. (Asteraceae: Calenduleae), an invasive weed in New Zealand
Boneseed, Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. monilifera, is a serious invasive weed in New Zealand, particularly in coastal habitats throughout the North Island, northern parts of the South Island, and in the Port Hills near Christchurch. The invertebrate fauna associated with boneseed in New Zealand was surveyed in 1999-2000 as part of a biological control programme for the weed. Boneseed is attacked by a wide range of native and exotic insects but damage is usually not severe. Potential biological control agents that feed on foliage or seeds are unlikely to meet with significant competition from species already resident in this country. However, the combined effect of generalist predators, such as Argentine ants and spiders, and parasitoids could inhibit the effectiveness of some of the invertebrates that would be potential biological control agents. In New Zealand, most (if not all) herbivore niches on boneseed are under-utilised, and there is considerable scope for the introduction of specialised invertebrates that could reduce the vigour of this invasive weed.
