Genetic diversity and structure of the invasive toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii
Strains of the invasive toxic cyanobacteria Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii were genetically evaluated with four genetic markers encompassing in total 2.9 kb (16S rRNA, ITS longer spacer, ITS shorter spacer and rpoC1) to assess the phylogenetic relationships, genetic variation and population differentiation of the species across all five continents. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the C. raciborskii strains grouped into three well-supported distinct clusters: (I) European (II) African/American, and (III) Asian/Australian. The European group presented a high genetic similarity with the Asian and the Australian isolates than with the African and American isolates. Several Portuguese isolates were analyzed (n = 7) and revealed a low genetic differentiation with little geographical structure. The genetic distance among groups and phylogenetic relationships obtained in this study suggest that the recent invasion of C. raciborskii in Portuguese and other European temperate environments could have had its origin in the Asian and/or Australian continents.
