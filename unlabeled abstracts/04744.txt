In silico mining and characterization of 12 EST-SSRs for the invasive slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata
In silico mining of an expressed sequence tags (ESTs) library was found to be efficient at isolating simple sequence repeats (SSRs) loci in the non-indigenous marine mollusc Crepidula fornicata. Twelve SSR loci were developed for routine genotyping. Cross-species amplification to 8 other Crepidula species showed that the 12 loci are highly specific for C. fornicata. Mendelian inheritance was shown for 11 of them (1 being monomorphic in the analyzed offspring array). The genetic diversity for 88 adults was found to be variable across the 12 loci (2-40 alleles, expected heterozygosity between 0.023 and 0.898) with a high overall exclusion probability of 0.99. The degree of genetic polymorphism found here is similar to that shown for 7 anonymous SSRs previously developed and here used on the same samples. This set of 12 specific loci is relevant to perform reliable population and relatedness analyses in Crepidula fornicata.
