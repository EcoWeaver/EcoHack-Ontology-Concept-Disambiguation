Revision of the Neozeleboria cryptoides species group of thynnine wasps (Hymenoptera: Tiphiidae): Pollinators of native orchids
The Neozeleboria cryptoides group is defined for N. cryptoides (Smith) and N. flavicoxa sp. n., N. rarum sp. n., N. rufum sp. n., N. tabulata sp. n. and N. usitatum sp. n. from south-eastern Australia, and a key to males of these species given. Brief discussions are given on the group's relationship to other species of the genus, and on the generic relationships of Neozeleboria including Aulacothynnus Turner, which is synonymised with Neozeleboria Rohwer. A diagnosis for Neozeleboria is given and a key provided to distinguish several closely related genera. the almost unknown biology of Australian Thynninae is briefly reviewed with emphasis on the genus Neozeleboria and its role in the pollination of terrestrial orchids. Comments are made on the distribution of the species of Neozeleboria.
