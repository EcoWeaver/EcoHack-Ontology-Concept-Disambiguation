Mapping Downy Brome (Bromus tectorum) Using Multidate AVIRIS Data
Invasive plants impose threats to both natural and managed ecosystems. Downy brome is among the most aggressive invasive weeds that has infested the shrub-steppe ecoregion of eastern Washington. Hyperspectral remote sensing has potential for early detection and for monitoring the spread of downy brome--information that is essential for developing effective management strategies. Two airborne hyperspectral Advanced Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) images (electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 400 to 2,500 nm) were acquired at a nominal 4-m ground resolution over a study area in south-central Washington on July 27, 2000 and May 5, 2003. We used a mixture-tuned matched filtering (MTMF) algorithm to classify downy brome and predict its percent cover in each dataset plus a merged multiseasonal dataset using the transformed bands from a minimum noise fraction (MNF) output. The correlation coefficient was 0.79, calculated for the multidate MTMF predicted downy brome abundance, compared to 0.41 and 0.51 derived from the July 2000 and May 2003 data, respectively. Although this study used high spatial resolution (3 to 4 m) hyperspectral imagery, this result shows that data acquired in different seasons is more effective for detection of downy brome invasion, compared to single-date datasets. These results support expanded use of multitemporal data for weed mapping to capitalize on spectral differences between seasons for weeds, in this case downy brome, and the surrounding environment. Nomenclature: Downy brome, Bromus tectorum L. BROTE.
