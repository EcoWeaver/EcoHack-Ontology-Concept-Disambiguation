Life table parameters of the coccinellid Hyperaspis polita , a native predator in Iran, feeding on the invasive mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis
Hyperaspis polita Weise (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is one of the most important predators of the cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Sternorrhyncha: Coccoidea: Pseudococcidae), in southern Iran. The development, survivorship, longevity, reproduction, and life table parameters of this predator were evaluated at 25, 30, and 35 +- 1 degC, 65 +- 5% RH and a photoperiod of 14 L:10D. The duration of total pre-adult stage in males and females decreased from 32.63 and 30.06 at 25 degC to 19.96 and 19.37 days at 35 degC, respectively. The oviposition period of females was significantly affected by temperature that was, 47.73, 68.66 and 27.65 days with average egg production of 207.37, 505.50, and 151.03 at 25, 30, and 35 degC, respectively. According to the age-stage-two-sex life table, the highest value of the intrinsic rate of increase rm. were obtained at 30 (0.112 d- 1) and 35 degC (0.120 d- 1) with no significant difference. The finite rate of increase (l) was the highest at 30 (1.130 d- 1) and 35 degC (1.146 d- 1) with no significant difference. The net reproductive rate was the highest at 30 degC (R0 = 204.240 offspring) and the mean generation time was shortest at 35 degC (T = 29.87 d). The results indicate that suitable temperature for population development and fecundity of H. polita is around 30 degC, which could be a result of adaptation of this coccinellid predator to the warm climate of southwestern Iran.
