Further detection of an invasive gall midge, Contarinia maculipennis (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), on bitter gourd in Okinawa and on orchids in Fukuoka and Miyazaki, Japan, with urgent warning against careless importation of orchids
In 2005, gall midge larvae (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) were found infesting flower buds of bitter gourd, Momordica charantia (Cucurbitaceae), in Okinawa and orchids, Dendrobium spp. (Orchidaceae), in Fukuoka and Miyazaki Prefectures, Japan. On the basis of morphological features and molecular data of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I region, we identified all these gall midges as an invasive species, Contarinia maculipennis, which is a polyphagous pest infesting flower buds of various plant species across seven botanical families. In Japan, it was first detected in 1989 in orchid greenhouses on Okinawa Island. Since then, we have been concerned an injury by the gall midges to bitter gourd in the field because bitter gourd is one of the most important cash crops in Okinawa. Another anxiety has been that it may invade other parts of Japan directly from Southeast Asia. These concerns were realized in 2005. We urgently warn those who are responsible for orchid growing, international trading, and inspection, against the transporting potentially infested plants from country to country and from locality to locality within a country. We also emphasize a necessity to investigate the host range of C. maculipennis in Japan.
