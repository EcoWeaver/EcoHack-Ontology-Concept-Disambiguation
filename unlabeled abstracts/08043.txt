Analysis of population structure and genetic diversity in an exotic germplasm collection of Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn. using genic-SSR markers
Finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Geartn.) is one of the important small millets serves as a food security crop because of its high nutritional values. The complex tetraploid genome of finger millet requires a large number of informative, functional DNA markers for different applications in genetics and breeding. Yet, less number of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have been developed from expressed sequence tags in finger millet. In the present study, 56 new genic SSR markers were developed from publicly available drought related ESTs. The 43 polymorphic markers were used to evaluate polymorphism, revealed a range of PIC value 0.41 to 0.79. Our results suggest that, analyzed genotypes have high genetic diversity with an average gene diversity (h) of 0.176 and Shannon's information index (I) of 0.315. We conclude that there was a higher gene exchange within populations, by the value of overall gene flow (Nm) of 0.7721. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean and neighbor joining dendrogram generated three main clusters to differentiate genotypes and these results were also confirmed by PCA and PCoA analysis. The high genetic diversity (77%) was found within the populations in the analysis of molecular variance. A Bayesian model-based cluster analysis evidenced a high extent of admixture between the gene pools from the different geographical origins. Population based cluster analyses pointed out a strong pattern of 'isolation by distance'. Overall, these results underscored that this study showed a significantly high level of polymorphism, adequate genetic diversity and population structure which expand the modern genetic resources and its utility in various applications in genetics and genomics including association mapping and breeding.
