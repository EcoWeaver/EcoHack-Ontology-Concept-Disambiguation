Population genetics of invasive common carp Cyprinus carpio L. in coastal drainages in eastern Australia
The common carp Cyprinus carpio introduced in two drainages in eastern Australia are largely descended from European common carp, and in a third drainage they descend largely from East Asian common carp. The partial genetic differentiation among the species in those drainages is consistent with their origins.
