The forests of Robinson Crusoe Island, Chile: an endemism hotspot in danger
The Robinson Crusoe Island (RCI), part of Juan Fernandez Archipelago, contains more endemic plant species per area that any other insular system of the world (ca 1.9 sp/ km2). Currently exotic plants are invading all habitats on the island with more or less intensity. As two-thirds of the vascular plant species are considered to be in danger of extinction, the island has a high conservation priority for biodiversity, at local and global scale. Using already published information, we reviewed the main vegetation types defined for RCI, considering their plant species richness on IUCN conservation categories, their amount of invasive exotics plants, and the occurrence of landbird species. Furthermore, to perceive information needs for conservation, we analysed the main subjects of scientific publications developed about Juan Fernandez Archipelago. The highest proportion and number of endemic and endangered plant species was located in the upper and lower montane forest, where exclusively highly threatened and threatened bird species can be found. Until today research in Juan Fernandez and RCI has mainly focused on Botany, normally dealing with taxonomical aspects of singular plant taxa. The study of the ecology, structure, dynamics, processes and services of the forests on RCI has not been treated as main subjects in scientific publications. It seems urgent to understand these to be effective on future conservation and restoration initiatives.
