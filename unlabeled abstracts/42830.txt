Biological invasions on Russian territory: Mammals
The paper describes the alien mammalian species (62 species) that have penetrated and naturalized in regions new to them. Their taxonomic diversity, invasion pathway and remoteness, size of invaded area, and role in ecosystems are assessed. The invasions of alien mammals into terrestrial ecosystems of Russia are observed everywhere: on territories with a maximal influence of man on nature (cities, settlements, and cultivated lands) and on territories intended for preservation of their intact state (biosphere reserves).
