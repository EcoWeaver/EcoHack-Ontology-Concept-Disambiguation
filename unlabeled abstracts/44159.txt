Biological Invasion of Tomato Leaf Miner, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) in Nigeria: Problems and Management Strategies Optimization: A Review
Nigeria is the largest producer of tomato in Africa while the Northern regions are the main producers of tomatoes in the country. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) is widely cultivated and consumed in every part of Nigeria. It is an important commercial crop and good source of vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids, sugar and dietary fibers. The study aimed to report the outbreak of Tomato leafminer (Tuta absoluta) in tomato growing regions of Nigeria with a view to bring out its management strategies in Nigeria. The study was conducted in the major tomato producing regions which lies between latitudes 7.5deg11' and 13.0degN and a temperature range of 22 - 30degC. Tuta absoluta has been attributed to causing tomato shortage in Nigeria as a result of its devastating attack. The outbreak caused critical reduction in fruit yield which resulted in high cost of tomato. The damage is done by the larvae which tunnel into the stems, apical buds as well as the green and ripe fruits reducing their quality and subsequently the yields. Nonetheless, about 80 -100% yield loss had been reported. Tuta absoluta was reported to have developed resistance to a number of pesticides used in the country. Meanwhile, the Government had either less concern or neglect on the pest invasion or areas of researches especially on invasive species, thus poor funding which overstresses the existing challenges in controlling the pest. This paper intends to review some important highlights of Integrated Pest management (IPM) approaches for effective and efficient management strategies of the pest in Nigeria and beyond.
