Introduction: genetic biocontrol of invasive fish species
This special issue of Biological Invasions presents articles resulting from the International Symposium on Genetic Biocontrol of Invasive Fish that was convened June 21-24, 2010 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA (http://www.seagrant.umn.edu/ais/biocontrol). The symposium explored prospects and risks of genetic biocontrol--a new technological approach for controlling invasive finfish species that have established populations in natural ecosystems. The frustration by some fisheries managers regarding lack of well-targeted and effective tools to control invasive fish stimulated the organizing of this symposium (Kapuscinski and Patronski 2005).The motivations for and development of any technology are not divorced from influences of society and nature. Instead, technology is part of a co-evolutionary process of change involving interactions and feedbacks among values, systems of knowledge, institutions, technology and the environment (Norgaard 1994:27). This context-dependence is rarely treate ...
