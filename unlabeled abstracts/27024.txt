The efficiency of regional ballast water exchange: Changes in phytoplankton abundance and diversity
Ballast water was sampled on 12 occasions before and after an exchange process carried out in regional seas in order to assess the efficiency of this type of ballast water management at reducing the abundance and diversity of phytoplankton. Although there was an overall reduction in the average abundance and number of taxa after exchange this was not consistent between tanks and voyages. On some occasions there were changes in species composition after exchange and, in some cases, there were increases in potentially harmful species after the exchange process. Factors such as the depth of the water during the exchange process, the season and the method of exchange influenced the efficacy of the exchange process. The variability in the results after exchange mean that this is unlikely to be a ballast water management method that would give consistent results and careful consideration would have to be given to the suitability of using this method in regional seas as a means of reducing the risk of introducing non-native species.
