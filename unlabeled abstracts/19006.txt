Habitat enhancement and native fish conservation: can enhancement of channel complexity promote the coexistence of native and introduced fishes?
Native fishes worldwide have declined as a consequence of habitat loss and degradation and in-troduction of non-native species. In response to these declines, river restoration projects have been initiated to enhance habitat and remove introduced fishes; how-ever, non-native fish removal is not always logistically feasible or socially acceptable. Consequently, manag-ers often seek to enhance degraded habitat in such a way that native fishes can coexist with introduced species. We quantified dynamics of fish communities to three newly constructed side channels in the Provo River, Utah, USA, to determine if and how they pro-moted coexistence between native fishes (nine spe-cies) and non-native brown trout (Salmo trutta L.). Native and introduced fishes responded differently in each side channel as a function of the unique charac-teristics and histories of side channels. Beaver activity in two of the three side channels caused habitat differ-entiation or channel isolation that facilitated the estab-lishment of native species. The third side channel had greater connectivity to and similar habitat as the main channel of the Provo River, resulting in a similar fish community to main channel habitats (i.e. dominated by brown trout with only a few native fish species). These results demonstrate the importance of under-standing habitat preferences for each species in a com-munity to guide habitat enhancement projects and the need to create refuge habitats for native fishes.
