Establishment and survival of three invasive taxa of the genusReynoutria (Polygonaceae) in mesic mown meadows: A field experimental study
The effect of traditional management on the initial phase of invasion into mesic mown meadows was studied in the Krivoklatsko protected landscape area in Central Bohemia, the Czech Republic. In 1996, rhizome fragments of alien species native to Asia, i. e.Reynoutria japonica, R. sachalinensis and their hybridR. xbohemica were planted in experimental plots and their establishment recorded. Established plants were then subjected to the following six treatments which simulated the management practices traditionally used in the study area: mowing twice a year, grazing by goats and sheep separately at two different intensities, and a control plot. Plant survival was recorded in the two years following planting. In order to compare the effect of the growing period, the experiment withR. japonica was conducted in two subsequent years (1995 and 1996) thus allowing observations over three years on this species. The experiment was carried out in two sites (meadows), with three blocks of treatments established in each. Significantly better establishment was found inR. japonica andR. xbohemica than inR. sachalinensis. Survival of all three taxa was negatively effected by all the management treatments applied (P
