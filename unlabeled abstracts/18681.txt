Introduction: Marine Harvesting in the Arctic
Abstract In a warmer Arctic, living conditions will change at all trophic levels of the marine ecosystem. Increased air and water temperatures will likely substantially reduce ice coverage. Trophic interactions might change and increased competition between resident Arctic species and invasive species seems likely. A theme session on "Marine harvesting in the Arctic" was held at the international Arctic Frontiers Conference in Tromso, Norway, in January 2013. The theme session partitioned the topic into two sub-sessions: (i) introduced species, immigration and fate of resident species and (ii) prospective harvesting of marine biological resources in the Arctic. The four articles that follow this introduction are based on presentations made at the Arctic Frontiers theme session. These articles cover topics such as: how ice breeding seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) can cope with ice retention in the Northwest Atlantic, how planktonic stages of the resident polar cod (Boreogadus saida) and the pole-ward expanding Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) may compete for food in the warming Beaufort Sea, and how the introduced red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) disperse in the Barents Sea. The fourth article shows how differences in the life-history strategies of keystone zooplankton species will likely affect future productivity of commercial fisheries in polar regions.
