A second population of Cabomba caroliniana Gray (Cabombaceae) in Belgium with options for its eradication
We report a sizeable population of Carolina fanwort Cabomba caroliniana from Belgium. The new population was discovered in June 2013 and represents the only occurrence in the Atlantic region of this country. A previous record dates back to 1998 but by 2006 this population was eliminated unintentionally by dredging works. Cabomba caroliniana is expected to become a regulated invasive alien species of EU concern, in which case it will need to be eradicated. We briefly describe the site conditions, discuss possible measures for eradication and present a decision support scheme.
