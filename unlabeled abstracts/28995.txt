Increased performance of Cirsium arvense from the invasive range
The Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) hypothesis suggests that plants from the invasive range should perform better than plants of the same species from the native range. To properly test this, we need to compare growth of plants from the two ranges in a common environment. Ideally, all the natural enemies should be excluded, to make sure that the differences are not due to different response of plants from the two ranges to the natural enemies. We used the above design to examine the difference in growth and reproduction in Cirsium arvense plants from the invasive (North America) and native range (Europe). To account for possible differences within the ranges, we used plants from two regions, separated by at least 1000 km, in each range. Because the higher performance of species from the invasive range can be caused by their higher ability to acquire resources we compared growth of the plants in two different nutrient levels. The results indicate that plants from the invasive range are larger in most size parameters as well as parameters more closely related to fitness. For aboveground biomass, the response of plants from the invasive range to nutrient addition was weaker than that of plants from the native range and the difference between the ranges was stronger in the nutrient poor substrate. The results are in agreement with the EICA hypothesis and suggest that plants from the invasive range have higher ability to use resources and are thus able to perform well also in nutrient poor conditions.
