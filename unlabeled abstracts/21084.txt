Experimental evaluation of the impacts of the invasive catfish Hoplosternum littorale (Hancock, 1828) on aquatic macroinvertebrates
The hoplo catfish [Hoplosternum littorale (Hancock, 1828)] is a callichthyid catfish native to South America. It was first recorded in Florida in 1995. It has now dispersed throughout much of Florida. It is thought that this fish has had little or no impacts to native fish. However, it is unknown if the introduction of this fish can cause other ecological impacts, such as alteration of aquatic invertebrates assemblages. We conducted a cage experiment to evaluate the effects of the hoplo catfish on macroinvertebrates. Results showed that macroinvertebrate abundance and taxa on artificial substrates (MAS) were reduced by 31 and 50% in the fish treatments, respectively. The entire macroinvertebrate assemblage structure was significantly different between fish and no-fish treatments. This difference was driven primarily by reductions in amphipods, and chironomids. Macroinvertebrates were also identified from fish stomachs and these were compared to assemblages on the MAS. We found a smaller subset of taxa in the stomachs, as compared to the MAS. These results suggest that this fish could alter the macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. This could have implications for environmental monitoring programs that use macroinvertebrates to assess water quality.
