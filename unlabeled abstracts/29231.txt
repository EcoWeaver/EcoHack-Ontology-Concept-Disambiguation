Estimating the economic costs of invasive alien species as a tool for prioritization.
Abstract Studies frequently quantify the economic impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) by estimating their management and damage costs. Despite uncertainties in the cost estimation process, the resulting figures potentially allow managers to weigh species' relative impacts. However, IAS economic cost estimates are not the only factors that determine which species receive management priority, as evidenced by prominent eradication programmes in the UK and by the British Environment Agency's (EA's) 2006 list of target IAS. This literature review investigates British IAS cases to determine whether policy-makers utilize economic cost figures when prioritizing species for management. We focus specifically on the EA's ten priority IAS and consider whether the exclusion of other prominent British IAS from the EA's 'most wanted' list relates to their estimated costs. Comparing the various cases underscores the importance of cost estimation and also highlights three other factors that feature prominently in IAS prioritization: threat to biodiversity, IAS distribution and management feasibility. Certain costly IAS do not currently receive national management attention (e.g. the pondweeds Elodea spp.) because they are either too widespread or too difficult to manage in a coordinated, national campaign. In comparison, the EA quickly prioritized the new arrival Ludwigia grandiflora (water primrose) for management because of its high potential costs, limited dispersal and feasibility of eradication.
