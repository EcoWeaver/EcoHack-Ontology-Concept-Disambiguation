First record of Corbicula largillierti (Philippi 1844) in the Paraiba River Basin and potential implications from water diversion of the Sao Francisco River
Corbicula largillierti is a native mollusk from China. In Brazil, this species was first recorded in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso. This short communication reports the occurrence of C. largillierti for the first time in the Paraiba river basin (Brazilian semi-arid), and also considers the risk of introduction of other molluscs invaders in this basin due to the diversion of water from the Sao Francisco River. Densities of individuals ranged from 33 to 65 ind.m-2 (maximum values of 484 ind.m-2) in coarse sediment (gravel, 2-4 mm). The diversion of waters from the Sao Francisco river can lead to the introduction of new species, enhancing ecological problems in the Paraiba river basin.
