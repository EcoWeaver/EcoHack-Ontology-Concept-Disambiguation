Invasion history, distribution, and relative abundances of Dreissena bugensis in the old world: a synthesis of data
We examined trends in expansion patterns and relative abundances of Dreissena bugensis in reservoirs and major river systems in eastern Europe. Based on our own data and data from the literature, it is apparent that trends were variable across river basins and not easily related to environmental conditions. In some cases these did not conform to the patterns typically found for dreissenids. In the early period of expansion beyond its native range in the Dnieper-Bug delta and estuary, D. bugensis rapidly replaced Dreissena polymorpha in the upper Dnieper River system, but increased only gradually and over time became less abundant relative to D. polymorpha in the Don-Manych River system. Contrary to the Dnieper and Don River systems, in the Volga River system considerable spatial variability in relative abundances was apparent, particularly in northern reservoirs. Moreover, even though D. bugensis usually displaces D. polymorpha as the dominant dreissenid, the latter can remain dominant in certain types of habitats where conditions are less favourable for the former. Suggested factors that may be responsible for differences in invasion patterns in the river systems may include differential responses to temperature, or to some other factor(s) associated with geographical latitude, the level of water mineralization, and selective predation by molluscivorous fish. In particular, the northward expansion of D. bugensis seems to be limited by temperature. The lack of long-term data on appropriate scales precludes linking these differences to specific features within the environment, but our comparisons indicate that the expansion of D. bugensis relative to D. polymorpha is more complex than previously believed.
