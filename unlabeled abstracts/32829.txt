Isognomon bicolor (C. B. Adams, 1845) (Mollusca: Bivalvia): first record of this invasive species for the States of Paraiba and Alagoas and new records for other localities of Northeastern Brazil
This study provides the first record of the exotic invasive bivalve Isognomon bicolor for the State of Paraiba, Northeastern Brazil. It has been found to occur in at least twelve coastal reefs along the coast. We also present its first record for the State of Alagoas and new record localities for the States of Rio Grande do Norte and Pernambuco, including its occurrence in hypersaline estuaries. From these records the distribution range of I. bicolor has been expanded to the littoral region of Northeast Brazil, where this invasive species seems well established.
