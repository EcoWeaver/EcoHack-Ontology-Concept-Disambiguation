Recent spread and climatic ecological niche of the invasive guava fruit fly, Bactrocera correcta, in mainland China
The guava fruit fly, Bactrocera correcta (Bezzi) (Diptera:Tephritidae), is a harmful exotic insect pest in mainland China, which was first recorded in Yuanjiang County of Yunnan province in 1982. In order to elucidate its rate of spread, extensive field surveys were conducted during 2003-2011. Through 2011, B. correcta was found in areas below 1,500 m in altitude within the Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region of southwestern China (21-28degN latitude, 97-107degE longitude). The northernmost site where B. correcta was found was in Miyi County (26.48degN Latitude, 102.00degE longitude, Alt. 1,060 m) in Sichuan province. Within the currently infested area of mainland China, B. correcta mainly occurred in low-altitude valleys and basins, and displayed a patchy distribution. The mountain chains tend to run south to north, forming a natural barrier to insect flight eastward and westward. Human-assisted transport of infested fruits was the likely factor by which B. correcta moved across mountain chains. The analysis indicated that high-altitude portions of the northern Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region may block B. correcta spread northward.
