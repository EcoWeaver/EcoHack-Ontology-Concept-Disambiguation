Invasion of alien Prosopis species in Israel, the West Bank and western Jordan: characteristics, distribution and control perspectives
The invasion history of alien Prosopis (mesquite) in Israel and Jordan is presented, with a detailed description of the introduction, background and the habitats now infested with Prosopis in these countries. While the number of escaped individuals in Israel is still limited, Prosopis has invaded large areas in Jordan and has become the main invasive alien tree in the Jordan valley. It is also now spreading in the canyons of south Jordan. The distinct prosopis invasion patterns in Israel and Jordan are discussed. Control programs are urgently needed in order to contain the proliferation of Prosopis, which now poses a major threat to natural habitats as well as to fallow fields. The ongoing establishment of dense thickets of Prosopis along wadis with year-round water flow is likely to displace native species such as Acacia raddiana Savi, and to alter the function of natural ecosystems.
