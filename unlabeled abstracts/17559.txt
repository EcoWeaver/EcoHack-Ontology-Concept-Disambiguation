A new approach using biomarkers to elucidate the regression state of the invasive alga Caulerpa taxifolia in waters around the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean Sea)
Invasive algae alter the structure and function of ecosystems. The green alga Caulerpa taxifolia is an invasive alga introduced in the Mediterranean Sea, whereas Caulerpa prolifera is a native species in Mediterranean waters. The aim of the current work was to determine the oxidative status of both Caulerpa species by means of biomarker measures as a possible indicator of the regression state of C. taxifolia in waters around the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean Sea). The levels of markers of lipid peroxidation, glutathione concentration, activities of antioxidant enzymes and caulerpenyne production were measured in C. prolifera and C. taxifolia fronds. The concentration of the end product of lipid peroxidation, malondialdehyde, was significantly higher in C. taxifolia than in C. prolifera samples. Antioxidant enzyme activities, namely superoxide dismutase glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, as well as the reduced glutathione : glutathione disulfide ratio were lower in C. taxifolia than in C. prolifera, although the concentrations of malondialdehyde were higher in the alien species. No differences were found in catalase activity or in the concentration of caulerpenyne. In conclusion, the invasive alga C. taxifolia presented a more oxidised status, which could be related to its regression in Mallorcan coastal waters.
