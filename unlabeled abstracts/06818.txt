Hydrocarbon profiles throughout adult Calliphoridae aging: A promising tool for forensic entomology
We identified unique hydrocarbon profiles for two adult Calliphoridae species.*The adult hydrocarbon profiles shifted as adults aged for both species.*The most unique hydrocarbon profiles occurred on the first day post-emergence.*Adult flies found at death scenes could be used to improve minimum PMI estimates.
