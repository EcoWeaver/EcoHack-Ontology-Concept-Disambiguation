Tackling invasive alien species in Europe II: threats and opportunities until 2020
Invasive alien species (IAS) are a significant and growing problem worldwide. In Europe, some aspects of IAS have been addressed through existing legal instruments, but these are far from sufficient to tackle the problem in a comprehensive manner. The Top 20 IAS issues for Europe were determined at the 1st Freshwater Invasives - Networking for Strategy (FINS I) conference, held in Ireland in 2013. The FINS II conference considered the relevance of those Top 20 issues three years later (2016) and following the enactment of targeted EU IAS legislation. It further determined the current top 10 threats and the top 10 opportunities relating to IAS in Europe using a similar format to that employed at FINS I. Four workshop break-out sessions 1) legislation remit in both EU/non-EU countries; 2) best management and biosecurity practice for control; 3) data management and early warning; and 4) pathways of introductions and citizen science identified the most prominent threats and opportunities with subsequent voting at a synthesis session ranking the top 10 threats and opportunities. In total, 80 delegates (academics, applied scientists, policy makers and stakeholders), from 14 EU and 3 non-EU countries, including 10 invited speakers, participated in the FINS II conference. Overall, the results underlined the importance of international cooperation on IAS. Issues such as cooperation and communication, education and funding are a priority, as are the standardization of legislation, control methods and best practise for research.
