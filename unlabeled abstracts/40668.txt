Local extinction of a rare plant pollinator in Southern Utah (USA) associated with invasion by Africanized honey bees
Twenty-five years ago, Arctomecon humilis, a pollinator-dependent, endangered poppy globally restricted to the extreme northeastern Mojave Desert in southwestern Utah, was pollinated by native bee species and the European honey bee. Follow-up studies beginning in 2012 failed to find the two most important native bee pollinator species, one of which, Perdita meconis, is a strict poppy specialist. We had four objectives: (1) confirm the status of formerly important native bee pollinators; (2) determine the role of the Africanized honey bee which reportedly invaded southern Utah in 2008; (3) examine the effect of the ostensible change in pollinator fauna on fruit set in four populations; (4) describe the pollination proficiency of species that presently visit poppy flowers. For the fourth consecutive survey, P. meconis was absent; its local extinction in Utah now seems certain. Another previously important native pollinator, Eucera quadricincta, was very rare. Also uncommon was the European honey bee, having been largely replaced by Africanized honey bees which have become, in most populations, the prevalent pollinator. Africanized bees forage early in the day and quickly strip flowers of their copious pollen leaving little for native bees. We argue that the invasion of southern Utah by Africanized bees is the most likely cause of the severe disruption of the A. humilis pollination system. The ascension of the Africanized bee is also associated with reduced fruit set in all poppy populations, especially those where plants are sparse. Arctomecon humilis now appears to depend mostly on an invasive species for pollination.
