Assessing the threat of exotic plant pests
The applicability of multi-criteria evaluation methodologies to complex decision-making processes has been well demonstrated, particularly in cases involving environmental externality problems. However, their use in resource allocation decisions to invasive species risk management is rare. In this paper, a deliberative multi-criteria evaluation technique is applied to a case study in which a jury is asked to prioritise a set of plant pests and diseases in Western Australia. The species chosen were of varying impact, ranging from species with predominantly agricultural impacts to those of purely environmental or social importance to the community. Biological, ecological and economic information was conveyed to jurors before they were asked to rank each species in order of perceived significance to the State's biosecurity system using a Deliberative Multi-criteria Evaluation process. The resultant prioritisation was found to differ from current resource allocations.
