Variation of Abundance and Demographic Structure of the Introduced Pumpkinseed, Lepomis Gibbosus (Actinopterygii: Perciformes: Centrarchidae), in Relation to Littoral Habitats and Water Body Use
INTRODUCTION The pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbous (L.), is a telling example of successful fish introduction into the majority of European inland bodies of water (Crivelli and Mestre 1988, Holcik 1991, Welcomme 1991, Tomecek et al. 2007). The native environment of this species is being affected by the warm climate of eastern North America (Scott and Crossman 1973). It is thought that pumpkinseed was first imported around 1880 from Canada (Garcia-Berthou et al. 2005). Initially, L. gibbosus was released, as an ornamen-tal fish, to garden ponds and aquaria (Copp et al. 2005a). Later pumpkinseed was spread by re-stocking material of common carp (Tandon 1976). Nowadays, this species is widely dispersed in Central and Western Europe (Welcomme 1991), as well as in Iberian and Balkan Peninsulas (Elvira and Almodovar 2001, Economidis et al. 2000). In northern areas, pumpkinseeds were found to be abundant only in artificial-or heavily disturbed water bodies (van Kleef et al. 2008). The distribution, growth, and feeding behaviour of pumpkinseeds are subject to profound analyses, mainly with aim to assess the potential impact of this alien ACTA ICHTHYOLOGICA ET PISCATORIA (2012) 42 (2): 121-130
