Perception of Coastal Hazards in Terms of Physical, Biological, and Human-Induced Cascades: An Example from the Southeast Florida Coastal Zone (SFCZ)
Discussions of coastal hazard impacts commonly emphasize geomorphological, geodynamic, and meteohydrodynamic physical events. A true census of all coastal hazards must also, however, include not-so-obvious biological and anthropogenic impacts. Biological coastal hazards are now more common because increasing human presence along shores fosters contact with hazardous biological flora and fauna. Human-induced hazards, often viewed as normal daily activities, cryptically lead to unwanted erosion and deposition or to the pollution of coastal marine environments. The South Florida Coastal Zone (SFCZ) is a good example of how all three categories of coastal hazards (physical processes, biological ecodynamics, and anthropogenic machinations) collectively constitute a negative-pressure cascade upon the coast. Accurate identification and assessment of coastal hazard cascades is the critical 'first step' in forming effective disaster resilience through public awareness.
