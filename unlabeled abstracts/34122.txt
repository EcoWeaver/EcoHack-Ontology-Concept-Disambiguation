Conspecific and heterospecific plant-soil biota interactions of Lonicera japonica in its native and introduced range: implications for invasion success
We tested the 'enemy release hypothesis' in relation to Lonicera japonica to determine the effects of soil microbes on plant growth. It was hypothesized that plant performance in the introduced range in Australia would be increased by escaping natural enemies in soils in its native range of Japan, and thus there was increased likelihood of invasion success. Greenhouse experiments were carried out where plants (stem cuttings) of L. japonica were inoculated with soil microbiota (conspecifics vs. heterospecifics) from either the native range in Japan or the introduced range in Australia. Survival rates and plant growth characteristics were documented, and overall plant performance as feedbacks were calculated. The results showed that the growth of L. japonica was influenced by soil microbial communities. Plant growth performance indicated strong negative feedback when grown in its native-range soil and positive feedback when grown in its introduced range soil. Difference between ranges was noticed that includes more positive feedback when L. japonica was grown in conspecific soil compared to when it was grown in the conditioned by heterospecifics from the introduced range and more negative feedback in conspecific soils compared to heterospecific soil in the native range. The findings are consistent with the 'enemy release hypothesis' and clearly indicate that plant-soil microbes' interactions of L. japonica can play an important role in facilitating the survival and growth of L. japonica in its introduced range.
