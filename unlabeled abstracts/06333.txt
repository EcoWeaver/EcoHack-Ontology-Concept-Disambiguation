'Neo-Europe' and its ecological consequences: the example of systematic degradation in Australia's inland fisheries
The antiquity of human impact on ecosystems is increasingly understood, though the arrival of settlers to new lands remains a defining period. Colonization of the 'neo-Europes', a reference from the discipline of history, precipitated changes in aquatic ecosystems through modification of waterways and introductions of non-native species. We considered historical fisheries and fish market records from South Australia (1900-1946) against contemporary production statistics (1987-2011). Native inland species historically contributed large quantities to the market but have deteriorated such that fishing is now limited, and conservation regulations exist. This pattern mirrors the demand-driven transition from freshwater to marine fisheries in Europe; hence, we propose that this pattern was predicated on societal expectations and that European settlement and introduction of non-native fishes led to systematic overexploitation and degradation of native inland fisheries species in Australia, representing a further consequence of neo-European colonization to ecology. Accurate interpretation of ecological change can ensure more appropriate management intervention. Concepts, such as neo-Europe, from alternative disciplines can inform the recognition and evaluation of patterns at regional and global scales.
