The vector ecology of introduced Culex quinquefasciatus populations, and implications for future risk of West Nile virus emergence in the Galapagos archipelago
Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae), an important vector of West Nile virus (WNV) in the U.S.A., was first detected on the Galapagos Islands (Ecuador) in the 1980s. However, little is known of its ecology, distribution or capacity for arbovirus transmission in the Galapagos. We characterize details of lifecycle (including gonotrophic period), temporal abundance, spatial distribution, vector competence and host-feeding behaviour. Culex quinquefasciatus was detected on five islands of the Galapagos during 2006-2011. A period of 7-14 days was required for egg-adult emergence; water salinity above 5 ppt was demonstrated to hinder larval development. Blood-meal analysis indicated feeding on reptiles, birds and mammals. Assessment of WNV vector competency of Galapagos C. quinquefasciatus showed a median infectious dose of 7.41 log10 plaque-forming units per millilitre and evidence of vertical transmission (minimal filial infection rate of 3.7 per 1000 progeny). The distribution of C. quinquefasciatus across the archipelago could be limited by salt intolerance, and its abundance constrained by high temperatures. Feeding behaviour indicates potential to act as a bridge vector for transmission of pathogens across multiple taxa. Vertical transmission is a potential persistence mechanism forWNV on Galapagos. Together, our results can be used for epidemiological assessments of WNV and target vector control, should this pathogen reach the Galapagos Islands.
