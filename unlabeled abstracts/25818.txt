New phytoplankton species in the Bay of Fundy since 1995
Abstract Martin, J. L., and LeGresley, M. M. 2008. New phytoplankton species in the Bay of Fundy since 1995. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 759-764. A monitoring programme was initiated in 1987 to study phytoplankton populations in the Western Isles region of the Bay of Fundy, southwest New Brunswick. Samples are collected weekly from May through October, and monthly during the remaining months, to determine phytoplankton distribution and abundance at Brandy Cove, Lime Kiln Bay, Deadmans Harbour, the Wolves Islands, and mid-Passamaquoddy Bay. Since the programme was initiated, several previously absent or non-indigenous species have been found, suggesting that new species may have been introduced to the area. In order to establish a baseline for species indigenous to Bay of Fundy waters, we have taken a conservative approach and termed species reported for the first time in the Bay of Fundy system since 1995 as "new" species. New species include the following: (dinoflagellates) Alexandrium pseudogonyaulax, Amphidinium carterae, A. sphenoides, Ceratium macroceros, Polykrikos schwartzii, Preperidinium meunieri, Protoperidinium crassipes, and Pyrocystis lunata; (diatoms) Attheya septentrionalis, Attheya longicornis, Chaetoceros radicans, Cylindrotheca gracilis, Grammatophora serpentina, Lithodesmium undulatum, Mediopyxis helysia, Membraneis challengeri, Neodenticula seminae, Odontella sinensis, Proboscia eumorpha, Pseudo-nitzschia subpacifica, Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta, and Thalassiosira punctigera.
