Environmental factors associated with the occurrence of the Ponto-Caspian gobies in a lowland river belonging to the central European invasion corridor
Ponto-Caspian goby fish belong to the most successful invaders in freshwater ecosystems of Europe and North America. So far, three alien goby species have been present in the Polish section of the Dnieper-Rhine River corridor: the monkey goby Neogobius fluviatilis, the racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus, and the western tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris. Their assemblages in this region are unique because, in contrast to their native region or the Danube-Rhine corridor, they are unaffected by other gobiid species. We conducted electrofishing and habitat quality surveys to gather information on key environmental factors associated with the distribution of these fish in the lower river Vistula, which constitutes a vast middle part of the corridor used by the Ponto-Caspian species to migrate westward in Europe. We showed that the sandy bottom was beneficial for the monkey goby allowing the species to attain the highest abundance among the gobies in the river. Habitat complexity generated by artificial bank structures, as well as dense macrophyte coverage in the main channel, favoured mostly the expansion of the racer goby. Off-channel areas with vegetation and a muddy bottom (old river beds and pools) were the most suitable habitats for the western tubenose goby. We did not find any negative spatial relationships among gobies of various species and sizes except the avoidance of the monkey goby by small western tubenose goby. Thus, our study demonstrates substantial habitat partitioning, suggesting a low level of interspecific competition among the three species in a lowland river.
