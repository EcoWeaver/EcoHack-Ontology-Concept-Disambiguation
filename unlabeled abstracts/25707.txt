Rare, threatened and alien species in the gastropod communities in the clay pit ponds in relation to the environmental factors (The Ciechanowska Upland, Central Poland)
The objectives of the present survey were to formulate a zoocenological analysis of the gastropod communities in clay pit ponds, as well as to determine the relationships between the gastropods and their environments, and to evaluate the water habitats in terms of their ecologicalconservation value. The physical and chemical parameters of water, gastropod species and macrophytes occurring in the ponds indicate mesotrophic conditions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals a correlation between gastropod density and nitrates, a correlation between gastropod density and alkalinity, and additionally shows a correlation between gastropod density and chlorides. The pond surface area, nitrates, chlorides concentrate, alkalinity, and substratum have all affected these gastropod communities. The occurrence of the first permanent population of Ferrissia clessiniana (Jickeli, 1882) was recorded in Poland. Valvata naticina Menke 1845 has become a critically rare species (CR) due to the pollution of water environments. Five other species, e.g. Anisus vorticulus (Troschel, 1834) and Planorbis carinatus O.F. Mu" ller, 1774 are recorded on the Polish Red List of Species. The clay pit ponds of the Ciechanowska Upland, because of their distinctive environmental features, provide a refuge where a number of rare, threatened and alien gastropod species live.
