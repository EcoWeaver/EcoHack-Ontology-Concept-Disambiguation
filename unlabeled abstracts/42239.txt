Pteridium Aquilinum (L.) Kuhn (Bracken) As an Invasive Species in Permanent Grassland Ecosystems - Possibilities and Methods of Control
. Pteridium species around the world are aggressive, very productive, functionally closer to shrubs than ferns. Their rhizomes, buried deep and rich in starch, allow them to survive repeated fires and their efficient uptake of nutrients allow them to exploit a wide range of soils (McGlone et al., 2005). Mechanical methods. Tillage and cultivation. On lands that are not too steep or rocky, a good reduction in fern coverage can be achieved by plowing from late June to early August. The goal is to plow deep in order to expose the rhizomes, leaving them undisturbed throughout the winter and followed by the spring sowing
