The effects of invasive grass on seedling recruitment of native Atriplex polycarpa (Torr.) S. Watson (Chenopodiaceae) shrubs in the San Joaquin Valley of California
Invasive annual grasses are widespread across the arid Western United States, including native saltbush communities in the San Joaquin Valley of California. We hypothesized that the grasses limit saltbush seedling recruitment, leading to persistently invaded grasslands and thereby inhibiting saltbush succession. We predicted that this could happen due to (1), competition for water between grasses and saltbush seedlings and (2), a dense cover of senesced shoots known as residual dry matter (RDM). We conducted an experiment manipulating competition, RDM presence, and shade over a 2-year period. On a seasonal basis, we measured seedling density for the saltbush Atriplex polycarpa. Grass competition and RDM both reduced density, though RDM had a larger treatment effect. Final density was low in all treatments, but it was lowest in the treatment with both competition and RDM. We conclude that invasive grasses can negatively influence the recruitment of A. polycarpa, and that a primary mechanism through which this occurs is through inhibition by a dense cover of RDM. Removal of RDM is a promising technique to mitigate the negative impact on saltbush seedling recruitment.
