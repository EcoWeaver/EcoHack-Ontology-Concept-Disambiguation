Invasive trees show only weak potential to impact nutrient dynamics in phosphorus-poor tropical forests in the Seychelles
In the case of the litter decomposition rates, the small differences between species may also be related to the site quality, which may explain why higher nutrient concentrations among invasive species did not generally translate into higher decomposition rates. At very infertile sites, initial rates of decomposition are often determined more by the carbon quality and polyphenol concentration of litter than by its nutrient concentrations (Hobbie 2000; Bridgham & Richardson 2003). In our study, the rate of litter decomposition was significantly correlated with several parameters, including SLA, tannin concentration, nitrogen concentration and C : N ratio, but none of these could be identified as the single most important factor. However, two other results suggest that the N concentration was of minor importance, and that C quality was the major factor limiting decomposition. First, the litter of F. moluccana and C. verum released nutrients during initial decomposition, despite having high C : N and C : P ratios compared to the values cited as the critical ratios for immobilization (cf. Bridgham & Richardson 2003). Second, we carried out an ancillary laboratory experiment where litter of C. verum and N. hornei was allowed to decompose in soils sampled at the 15 field plots, either with or without fertilisation (N, P or complete fertilizer) (Kueffer 2006). None of the fertilizer treatments influenced decomposition rates. This could not be due to high nutrient availability in soil (e.g. due to the disturbance associated with sampling, mixing and filling the pots) because cotton pieces incubated in the same way decomposed faster with complete fertilizer.
