Genetic variation of Spartina alterniflora intentionally introduced to China
Spread of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) in China is an exceptional example of unanticipated outcomes arising from intentional introductions. It has been proposed that in China, management strategies used to establish S. alterniflora inadvertently promoted evolutionary outcomes that have contributed to other Spartina invasions. In this study, we assessed whether S. alterniflora in China exhibits genetic signatures of mechanisms known to promote invasion success, including large founding populations, evolved self-fertility, 'superior source ecotypes', and post-introduction admixture. This involved comparing microsatellite genotype and chloroplast haplotype variation among Chinese populations to other invasive S. alterniflora populations as well as native range populations, inclusive of samples from all reported source areas. We found distinct signatures of source population contributions to Chinese populations, as well as evidence of post-introduction admixture, and no evidence of limitations from a genetic bottleneck. Measures of inbreeding were well below what has been found in other non-native populations that have evolved self-fertility. Differences in genetic diversity among sites were similar to latitudinal patterns in the native range, but could be attributable to introduction history. Comparisons to other invasive populations indicate that a combination of common and idiosyncratic processes have contributed to the success of S. alterniflora in China and elsewhere, with intentional introductions promoting mechanisms that accelerate rates of spread and widespread invasion.
