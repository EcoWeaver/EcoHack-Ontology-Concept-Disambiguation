New Record of the non-Native SeaweedGracilaria parvisporain Baja California - A Note on Vergara-Rodarteet al.(2016)
The delimitation of species in the Gracilariales is often difficult due to the lack of diagnostic morphologicalcharacters. As aresult, non-native species are often misidentified without the use of moleculartools. Recently, studies have investigated the agar quality of the dominant gracilarioids pecies in the Laguna San Ignacio in Baja Califronia Sur,M exico, including Ve rgara-Rodarte et al.,(2016) published in the May edition of Cryptogamie, Algologie.T he species has been reported as Gracilaria pacifica, G. vermiculophylla and Gracilariopsis sp. Using ac ombination of three mitochondrial and plastid markers, we identified this species as G. parvispora,e xtending the known distribution of this non-native species in Baja California. Due to the potential of G. parvispora as as ource of agar,m ore detailed studies of on the invasion history and surveys are necessary in the eastern Pacificto determine its current distribution and impacts on the native biodiversity.
