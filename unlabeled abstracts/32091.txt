An overview of species introduction and invasion processes in marine and coastal lagoon habitats
The species introduction process involves a donor region, a vector, a corridor, a recipient region, a candidate species and a variety of filters that hinder the process. All these parameters are of importance for understanding the success or the failure of a non-native species. Some characteristics of the recipient area, such as low species diversity, disturbances and climate warming, which are often said to facilitate the introduction process in the terrestrial realm, may be of far lesser importance in the marine environment. In contrast, the role of the vector and of the corridor might have been underestimated.
