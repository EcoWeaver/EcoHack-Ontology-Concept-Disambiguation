High colonization and propagule pressure by ship ballast as a vector for the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia
Most harmful diatoms belong to the marine, planktonic genus Pseudo-nitzschia and are responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning through the production of domoic acid. Fifteen Pseudo-nitzschia species, nine of them toxigenic (approximately 60% of the species found in our samples) were recovered from 185 ship ballast tanks (water and sediment) destined for Canadian ports. Our results demonstrate that the three Canadian coastal regions receive considerable total propagule pressure (1.2 x 10 13
