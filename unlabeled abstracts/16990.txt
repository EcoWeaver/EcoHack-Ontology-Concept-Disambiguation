Sperm cryopreservation in wild animals
Extinction of a species represents the loss of a resource evolved through years of mutations and natural selection. New reproductive technologies include artificial insemination, embryo transfer, in vitro fertilization, gamete/ embryo micromanipulation, semen sexing, and genome resource banking have been developed. Usually, the reproductive technologies are specie-specific or inefficient for many non-domestic specie because of insufficient knowledge on basic reproduction. Although protocols from domestic or non-threatened relatives species have been extrapolated to non- domestic species, studies in male and female reproductive physiology are required to develop protocols adapted to each endangered species. Since spermatozoa are more accessible than oocytes and embryos, are considered the primary cell types preserved in most emerging genetic resource banks. Long-term storage of semen by cryopreservation is essential for the genetic resource banks of endangered species. Due to the intractability of most exotic species, sperm collection without chemical restraint is very limited. Viable epididymal spermatozoa can be obtained from dead animals, but this resource is also limited. However, electro-ejaculation and/or transrectal ultrasound-guided massage of the accessory sex glands of living animals are alternative viable method of sperm collection. The final goal is to adapt and optimize the cryopreservation protocols for wild species, making feasible the sperm collection in the field, and to incorporate this genetic material in captive populations to increase genetic diversity. A genetic resource bank for the different ecotypes of Spanish Ibex (Capra pyrenaica), together with the studies in Beira antilope (Dorcatragus megalotis) or Persian onager (Equus hemionus onager) could be considered good examples.
