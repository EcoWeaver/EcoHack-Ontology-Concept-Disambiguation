Growth and mortality of red lionfish, Pterois volitans (Actinopterygii: Scorpaeniformes: Scorpaenidae), in the Parque Nacional Arrecife Alacranes, southern Gulf of Mexico, as determined by size-frequency analysis
Background. Biological invasions represent a threat to the ecological stability of the ecosystem. Two lionfi sh species, the red lionfi sh and the devil fi refi sh--both tropical marine predators native to the Indo-Pacifi c--were introduced to the Atlantic Ocean. However, only one--the red lionfi sh, Pterois volitans (Linnaeus, 1758)--has reached the level of an invasive species so far. It is crucial to learn its biology and ecology to understand trends of its invasion and impacts on native fauna, and to determine ecological changes as the invasion progresses. This study reports the growth and mortality of P. volitans in coral reefs of the Parque Nacional Arrecife Alacranes, off the northern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, in Southern Gulf of Mexico. Materials and methods. Lobster diver fi shers participated in voluntary captures of lionfi sh during the lobster fi shing seasons of 2010-2012. In the laboratory, lionfi sh were taxonomically identifi ed, measured, and weighed. Their length-weight relation was determined according to the commonly used equation: W = aTL b
