On the Well Posedness and Refined Estimates for the Global Attractor of the TYC Model
The Trojan Y Chromosome strategy (TYC) is a theoretical method for eradication of invasive species. It requires constant introduction of artificial individuals into a target population, causing a shift in the sex ratio that ultimately leads to local extinction. In this work we demonstrate the existence of a unique weak solution to the infinite dimensional TYC system. Furthermore, we obtain improved estimates on the upper bounds for the Hausdorff and fractal dimensions of the global attractor of the TYC system, via the use of weighted Sobolev spaces. These results confirm that the TYC eradication strategy is a sound theoretical method of eradication of invasive species in a spatial setting. It also provides a solid ground for experiments in silico and validates the use of the TYC strategy in vivo.
