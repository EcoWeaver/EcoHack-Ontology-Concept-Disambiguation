Photosynthetic and biochemical characteristics of invasive species (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., Ambrosia trifida L. and Iva xanthifolia Nutt.) depending on soil humidity and phenological phase
Environmental factors like temperature and soil humidity are recognized as influencing factors on photosynthetic response and organic productivity, distribution and biochemical characteristics of plants. Here we present measurements of gas exchange parameters, water-use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) of field-grown invasive species Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., Ambrosia trifida L. and Iva xanthifolia Nutt., in order to define their potentials as colonizers. Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) in leaves and flowers depending on soil humidity were also investigated. Results indicated species A. artemisiifolia as the colonizer with the highest physiological potential because of its high WUE in its vegetative phase and also the highest NUE and the highest photosynthesis/dark respiration ratio in its flowering phenological phase. It was found that the volatile compounds of Ambrosia species and Iva xanthifolia consist mainly of terpenic compounds. There was a significant difference among the species regarding qualitative composition of monoterpens and sesquiterpens and specific qualitative and quantitative ratio of monoterpens in flowers and leaves of A. artemisiifolia.
