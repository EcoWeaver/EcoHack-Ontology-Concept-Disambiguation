Evidence of predation on the Helmeted water toad Calyptocephalella gayi (Dumeril &amp;amp; Bibron, 1841) by the invasive African clawed frog Xenopus laevis (Daudin 1802)
We report the first record of predation on a Helmeted water toad Calyptocephalella gayi tadpole by an adult specimen of the invasive African clawed frog Xenopus laevis in the locality of Pichi, Alhue (Santiago Metropolitan Region). This finding is discussed in the light of new sightings, in which both species have been detected to coexist in different localities of central Chile.
