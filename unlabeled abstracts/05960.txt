Hybridization between the escaped Rosa rugosa (Rosaceae) and native R. blanda in eastern North America
Rosa rugosa, a vigorous ornamental shrub introduced from Asia in the 19th century, is now naturalized in coastal northeastern North America, where it occasionally grows in sympatry with the native R. blanda. To document hybridization between these species, evaluate its extent across the area of sympatry, and examine the use of morphology as a field monitoring tool, we sampled 179 individuals of parental species and putative hybrids in 13 pure and 11 mixed populations. We developed allele-specific primers to assay single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers from one chloroplast region and four low-copy nuclear introns. Our results revealed frequent bidirectional hybridization and infrequent introgression in sympatric populations of these species. The recurrent presence of F(1) hybrids in mixed populations indicated the weakness of early-acting reproductive barriers. Morphological data were concordant with molecular data and provided additional evidence for the presence of a few backcrosses. Morphological analyses yielded diagnostic characters for identifying hybrids and monitoring the hybrid zone. Such hybridization could ultimately lead to the genetic assimilation of R. blanda in mixed populations and to the formation of invasive hybrid genotypes, a phenomenon that is of economic and ecological concern because of the increasing number of exotic species worldwide.
