The comparative biology of environmental stress: behavioural endocrinology and variation in ability to cope with novel, changing environments
Highlights > Perturbations of the environment can be labile or permanent, with consequences for how animals respond. > The exposome is the sum of environmental factors affecting an individual from conception to death. > Allostasis and reactive scope concepts combine costs of daily routines and stress. > The adrenocortical response to stress includes hormone secretion, transport and response. > Stress responses involve modulation of robustness (resistance), responsiveness (flexibility) and resilience (recovery).
