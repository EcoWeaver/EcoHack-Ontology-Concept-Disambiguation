Data on optimisation of a multiplex HRM-qPCR assay for native and invasive crayfish as well as the crayfish plague in four river catchments
The data presented here corresponds to the research paper "Simultaneous detection of invasive signal crayfish, endangered white-clawed crayfish and the crayfish plague using environmental DNA". A crayfish-specific assay was designed and optimised using three real-time PCR supermixes (SYBR(tm) Green, SsoFast(tm) EvaGreen(r) and HOT FIREPol(r) EvaGreen(r)). Diagnostic high resolution melt (HRM) data from direct application of assay on both ex-situ eDNA water samples and field samples from four catchments (two in Wales, two in England) is presented in this article, displaying positive HRM profiles for invasive signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus), native white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) and crayfish plague causal agent (Aphanomyces astaci).
