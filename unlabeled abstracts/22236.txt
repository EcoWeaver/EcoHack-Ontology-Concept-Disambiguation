The introduction of the bryozoan Zoobotryon verticillatum (Della Chiaje, 1822) in northeast of Brazil: a cause for concern
This paper records the new occurrence of spaghetti bryozoan Zoobotryon verticillatum at the Port of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The study, carried out between 2006 and 2007, also monitored its proliferation. Six observation stations were selected from the estuarine area, as well as samples of benthic invertebrates. The species was initially detected on the pilings of the port and on the hull of a fishing boat. 9months later it was also found in four stations and on another fishing boat. The luxuriant colonial growth in the lower intertidal zone by the end of the study indicates that this species is well established in the estuarine area. This observation is consistent with the species' biological characteristics; thus, it can be defined as an invasive organism due to its aggressive behavior when occupying the substrate. Its presence in port installations and vessels provide evidence that biofouling on ships' hulls has been the most likely vector of introduction.
