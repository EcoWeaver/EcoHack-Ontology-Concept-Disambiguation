Invasion of the modern Polycystina (Euradiolaria) into the Arctic Ocean: Paleoecological aspects
The authors have established that, not earlier than 9000-10000 years ago, the main part of the modern fauna of polycystines (Polycystina, Radiolaria) migrated (and still continues to so do) from the Norwegian Sea into the Central Arctic Basin and the marginal seas of the Arctic Ocean's Eurasian sector. Polycystines penetrate into the seas of the Amerasian sector with subsurface waters of the Atlantic Ocean and, to a smaller extent, with Pacific surface waters through the Bering Strait. The prevalent group of polycystines is the order Nassellaria. Different (compared to the Norwegian Sea and North Pacific) structure of polycystine communities with a high degree of dominance of some species and taxa of higher rank confirms the indigenous nature of the polycystine fauna. The data presented give evidence of the rapid evolution of the polycystine community in the stressful conditions of the Arctic, the highly endemic nature of the Arctic fauna, and the intense current processes of speciation in the genus Actinomma. polycystines-Nasselaria-Arctic Ocean-genus Actinomma-speciation
