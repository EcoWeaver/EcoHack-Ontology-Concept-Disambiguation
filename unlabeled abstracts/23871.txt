Use of fungal biosystematics and molecular genetics in detection and identification of wood-decay fungi for improved forest management
Advances in fungal biosystematics and molecular genetics have clarified relationships among the wood-decay fungi and are providing new tools for their detection and identification. Species complexes of forest pathogens, including those within Heterobasidion, Armillaria, Laetiporus, and Phellinus, are being resolved. The ability to isolate fungal DNA directly from wood without in intermediate culturing step will greatly facilitate sampling and disease detection and has applications in forest disease management, hazard tree assessment, invasive species detection, and carbon cycling, sequestration and climate change research. Recent changes in fungal nomenclature and their application to forest pathology are discussed.
