Length-weight relationships of an invasive cyprinid fish (Carassius gibelio) from 12 Greek lakes in relation to their trophic states
The length-weight relationships of the cyprinid fish Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782) are described for the 12 most important lakes of Greece. Carassius gibelio is an allogynogenetic fish species, which was introduced into Greek lakes during the late 1970s. The values of the exponent b of the length-weight relationships ranged from 2.33 to 3.38, and varied with the trophic state of the lake. In eutrophic lakes these b values were significantly (P < 0.001) lower than in oligotrophic or mesotrophic lakes. Relationships between the b values and phosphorus concentrations were logarithmic: b = 1.37-0.13 log (PO4-P); total length, fork length and standard length were linear (in all cases: r2 > 0.95). In most of the lakes, populations consisted of females, with the exception of Pamvotis, Doirani and Koronia lakes where a small proportion were males.
