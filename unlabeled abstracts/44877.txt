Alternative stable ecological states observed after a biological invasion
AbstractAlthough biological invasions play an important role in ecosystem change worldwide, little is known about how invasions are influenced by local abiotic stressors. Broadly, abiotic stressors can cause large-scale community changes in an ecosystem that influence its resilience. The possibility for these stressors to increase as global changes intensify highlights the pressing need to understand and characterize the effects that abiotic drivers may have on the dynamics and composition of a community. Here, we analyzed 26 years of weekly abundance data using the theory of regime shifts to understand how the structure of a resident community of dung beetles (composed of dweller and tunneler functional groups) responds to climatic changes in the presence of the invasive tunneler Digitonthophagus gazella. Although the community showed an initial dominance by the invader that decreased over time, the theory of regime shifts reveals the possibility of an ecological transition driven by climate factors (summarized here in a climatic index that combines minimum temperature and relative humidity). Mid and low values of the driver led to the existence of two alternative stable states for the community structure (i.e. dominance of either dwellers or tunnelers for similar values of the climatic driver), whereas large values of the driver led to the single dominance by tunnelers. We also quantified the stability of these states against climatic changes (resilience), which provides insight on the conditions under which the success of an invasion and/or the recovery of the previous status quo for the ecosystem are expected. Our approach can help understand the role of climatic changes in community responses, and improve our capacity to deal with regime shifts caused by the introduction of exotic species in new ecosystems.
