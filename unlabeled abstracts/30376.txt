Zooplankton recolonization of the inner estuary of Bilbao: influence of pollution abatement, climate and non-indigenous species
Variations in mesozooplankton abundance and community structure in response to water quality improvement and to variations in hydro-climatic conditions were studied in the inner estuary of Bilbao from 1998 to 2011. A process of recolonization was observed with a marked increase in copepod abundance and a smaller increase in the abundances of appendicularians, meroplanktonic bivalves and gastropods, at the expense of the decrease in groups of gelatinous predators. Within the copepods, an initial phase in this recolonization occurred through an increase in neritic copepods. However, in a second phase, the non-indigenous species Acartia tonsa and Oithona davisae increased and became dominant. In the last 2 years, a third non-indigenous species Pseudodiaptomus marinus was observed in lower densities, and Calanipeda aquaedulcis abundance increased becoming co-dominant with A. tonsa. All non-indigenous copepod species had summer/autumn peaks and were characteristic of brackish conditions, which suggests that unsaturated ecological niches in brackish waters were important for the settlement of non-indigenous species. Pollution abatement allowed for zooplankton recolonization, but variations in community structure, both at the broad taxonomic group and at the copepod species level, were greatly influenced by hydro-climatic factors, temperature being the single best explanatory variable of zooplankton variations.
