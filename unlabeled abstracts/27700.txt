Invasive species in inland waters: from early detection to innovative management approaches
Papers collected for the present special issue of Aquatic Invasions are representative samples of topics from the ICAIS, CWE and SIL meetings. Highlights of these studies are structured into five themes: 1) Early detection and monitoring of invasive species, 2) Drivers of biological invasions, 3) Factors determining invasion success, 4) Impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and 5) Innovative management strategies to minimize the negative impacts of invasive species.
