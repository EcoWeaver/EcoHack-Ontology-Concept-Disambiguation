Substrate choice by the alien snail Ferrissia fragilis (Gastropoda: Planorbidae) in an industrial area: A case study in a forest pond (Southern Poland)
The aims of this study were to determine the substrate choice by the alien snail Ferrissia fragilis (Tryon, 1863) (Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia remains, Nuphar lutea floating leaves and leaf deposit) as well as the environmental factors that influence the occurrence of this species. From 9 (T. latifolia and P. australis) to 11 (leaf deposit) snail species occurred on each type of substrate. F. fragilis belonged to the eudominants on most of the substrate types. This species reached its highest average density on floating N. lutea leaves (271 ind. m-2) and the lowest was on P. australis (60 ind. m-2). It occurred in different periods during the snail collection: in the initial study period on the floating N. lutea leaves (May) and on P. australis in the final period of the study (September). In July, we found a few specimens in the postseptal form on T. latifolia remains. The results of RDA analysis confirm the association between F. fragilis and T. latifolia as well as with floating N. lutea leaves. F. fragilis occurs at sites that have a higher content of calcium and iron in the water. Alien species more increasingly appear in disturbed anthropogenic water-bodies. An important vector in the dispersion of F. fragilis was probably the water birds or the economic activities that are related with the use of this forest pond. Studies on the occurrence of alien species contribute important data on the activities that are taken to preserve the biodiversity of freshwater environments
