Contrasting functional responses of non-native invasive species along a tropical elevation gradient
One hypothesized invasion strategy (i.e. "try-harder") predicts that invaders exhibit plant functional traits that are better adjusted to the local environment than native species. Alternatively, the "join-the-locals" hypothesis predicts traits to converge between invasive and native species due to environmental filtering when conditions become more limiting to growth. We hypothesized that invasions strategies shift from "try-harder" to "join-the-locals" with increasing elevation. We used an elevational gradient along the resource-limited campo rupestre vegetation in Brazil to detect possible trait convergences between alien invaders and native plant species of three common families: Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. We found a significant trait convergence with elevation only in Asteraceae, suggesting a species-specific pattern, but also an important phenotypic variability of the alien invader. This supports the idea that the more resource-limited the environment, the more it filters out traits substantially diverging from the locally-adapted native community, thereby entailing a shift from "try-harder" to "join-the-locals" strategies. The invasive Poaceae species was also more acquisitive but did not exhibit any relation to the native community, . supporting the "try-harder" hypothesis. At last, the size of the invasive Fabaceae species decreased with elevation, mirroring the native Fabaceae species, but not the overall native community. Using an elevational gradient, but including more replicates and a thorough quantification of environmental conditions, offers a promising avenue for improving the understanding the seemingly idiosyncrasies of invasion pathways.
