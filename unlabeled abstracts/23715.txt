Diet composition of the Lessepsian bluespotted cornetfishFistularia commersoniiin the eastern Mediterranean
Adaptability is an important factor in defining success or failure of an introduced species. The bluespotted cornetfish, Fistularia commersonii, invaded the Mediterranean from the Red Sea and spread quickly, displaying an explosive growth pattern in the eastern and central Mediterranean. Stomach contents of the Lessepsian piscivore were studied from off the Lebanese coast in order to describe aspects of its feeding ecology in the new environment. Cornetfish of different sizes (25-112 cm Lt) and from various habitats and depths (1-40 m) were sampled over an 18-month period (May 2003 to November 2004). Only 29% of the individuals contained identifiable prey items. The diet of the invasive cornetfish comprised a large variety of prey (41 taxa), Spicara smaris and Boops boops being the most important. Comparisons among prey habitats showed that the invasive cornetfish fed preferably on schooling species living in the water column. A large diversity of prey species characterized autumn and winter seasons while S. smaris and B. boops dominated in the spring and summer. Diet did not vary significantly with predator size except for S. smaris, which was a more important prey to middle size-classes cornetfish. The invasion of F. commersonii might have an important effect on structure and population dynamics of native communities, however it seems premature to predict the potential impact on eastern Mediterranean ecosystems or fisheries.
