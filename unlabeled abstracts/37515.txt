Baccharis spicata (Asteraceae), a new potentially invasive species to Europe
Baccharis spicata, a species native to South America (southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and northeastern and central Argentina) is reported for the first time from Europe. In September 2015, two naturalized populations were detected in the surroundings of Porto (Matosinhos and Vila do Conde) in Portugal. Based on literature data, the species' taxonomy and nomenclature are analyzed and it is described and illustrated. Furthermore, its ecology, habitat, biology, and possible vector of introduction are discussed. Finally, its invasive potential for the European Union is assessed, based on climatic variables and two different risk assessment methods.
