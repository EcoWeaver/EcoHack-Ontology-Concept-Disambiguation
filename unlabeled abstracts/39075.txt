The chemical and biological variables were analysed in two sets of lab experiments with natural communities from mesotrophic (Gelendzhik) and eutrophic (Varna) coastal waters. While both species altered the chemical properties of experimental media, exerting structural and functional changes in the low food-web biological compartments, the results showed a stronger effect of B. ovata, most likely related to the measured higher rate of excretion and amount of released mucus. In addition the alterations in the Gelendzhik experiment were more pronounced, indicating that environmental implications on lower food-web are more conspicuous in mesotrophic than in eutrophic coastal waters
