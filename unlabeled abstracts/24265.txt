Update of the Pond Slider Trachemys scripta (Schoepff, 1792) records in Navarre (Northern Spain), and presentation of the Aranzadi Turtle Trap for its population control
The pond slider (Trachemys scripta), an American species considered one of the most harmful invasives in the world, has spread worldwide to many regions, including the Iberian Peninsula, where it is able to reproduce. Therefore, many eradication campaigns are being held in several places and various methods of elimination and trap models have been tried. We present the Aranzadi Turtle Trap (ATT), which has been tested with great effectiveness in a fluvial backwater stretch of the Arga River in Pamplona. Along with the ATT other traps were utilized, but they did not yield any results, while the ATT captured at least 70% of the detected Trachemys. Other new records of pond slider in Navarre are reported.
