Katamysis warpachowskyi Sars, 1877 (Crustacea, Mysida) invaded Lake Constance
The mysid Katamysis warpachowskyi Sars, 1877 originated in the Ponto-Caspian region and the associated river systems. The first evidence of its transgression of the limits of the watersheds of its natural Ponto-Caspian origin was found when three individuals were recorded in October 2009 in eastern Lake Constance (Austria). In March 2010, K. warpachowskyi comprised 10% of the mysid assemblage and was mainly found in rocky habitats. On both sampling dates, breeding females were present. Before this invasion, Limnomysis benedeni Czerniavsky, 1882, was the only mysid in Lake Constance and is also distributed in the Rhine river system. Since the two mysids coexist in Lake Constance, K. warpachowskyi will likely become established in the lake and further expand into the main part of the Rhine. K. warpachowskyi is known as a benthic organism and feeds on detritus and small algae; therefore, the impact on the lake ecosystem should be weaker than that of pelagic mysids.
