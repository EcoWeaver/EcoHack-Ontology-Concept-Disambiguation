A review of ecological interactions between crayfish and fish, indigenous and introduced
Crayfish (decapods) and fish are both long-lived large members of fresh-water communities, often functioning as keystone species. This paper reviews interactions between these, with emphasis on the European con-text. Native crayfish and fish are in ecological balance, which may involve mutual predation, competition and sometimes habitat disturbance. This balance is disrupted by range extensions and translocations of native fish or crayfish into exotic situations. Some fish and crayfish have been translocated globally, chiefly from North America to other continents. Non-indigenous crayfish species (NICS) may impact on native fish, just as in-troduced fish impact on indigenous crayfish species (ICS). Competition between ICS and NICS may result in making the former susceptible to various mechanisms of interaction with fish, indigenous or introduced. In Europe, long-established NICS - signals, spiny-cheek and red swamp crayfish - may occur in greater densities than ICS; they are more tolerant and aggressive and show more interactions with fish. More recent intro-ductions, still restricted in distribution, have not yet received enough study for their impacts to be assessed. Interactions between fish and crayfish in North and South America, Madagascar and Australasia are also explored. Mechanisms of interaction between fish and crayfish include mutual pre-dation, competition for food and spatial resources, food-web alteration and habitat modification. Resultant changes in communities and ecosys-tems may be physical or biotal, and affect both ecosystem services and exploitation potential.
