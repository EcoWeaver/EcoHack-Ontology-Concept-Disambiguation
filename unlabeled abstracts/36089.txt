Cultivated and native species of Gymnosperms to the flora of the Fujairah Emirate
The article provides an overview of the species of gymnosperms in the Fujairah emirate, located in the mountainous northeastern part of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We have been studying the flora of the emirate for a number of years, from 2017 to 2020. The composition of gymnosperms was estimated by means of field studies, surveys of irrigated gardens, public parks, urban plantings and nurseries, herbarium materials and literature data. The list of species includes wild and cultivated gymnosperms in open ground. Families, genera and species are listed alphabetically. Special list includes the data on species found only in plant nurseries. The list contains 13 species from 6 families and 9 genera, both wild and cultivated. A brief synonymy, morphological description, general distribution and distribution in Fujairahare given for each species. In addition, taxonomic comments are provided for a number of critical taxa. Most of the species are grown in the emirate as ornamental plants. The annotated list of cultivated species of gymnosperms for the region given in the article is the first, not final and suggests further research of the cultivated and wild flora of Fujairah.
