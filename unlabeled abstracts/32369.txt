Microelements and macroelements in the body of the invasive Harris mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii, Maitland, 1874) from the central coast of the South Baltic Sea
In this study, we determined the levels of essential and non-essential elements in the Harris mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii, Maitland, 1874) from the southern Baltic Sea. Results revealed high levels of Ca (246,000 ppm), Mg (11,000 ppm), Na (8160 ppm), K (3,780 ppm), and Fe (1830 ppm). The concentrations of essential metals such as Zn (62.5 ppm) and Cu (25 ppm) were similar to those recorded in other crab species. The concentrations of non-essential metals such as Pb (0.140 ppm), Cd (0.0017 ppm), and As (0.288 ppm) were well below the International Standards for Maximum Levels for Food. In view of the above, the Harris mud crab from the southern Baltic is safe to be used as a component of well-balanced feeds for terrestrial and aquatic animals.
