Rooting damage to farmland in Dorset, southern England, caused by feral wild boar Sus scrofa
1. Characteristics of damage to agricultural land caused by a small feral population of wild boar Sus scrofa in southern England were studied. Fifty-eight reports of rooting damage to grassland and one of rooting in a cereal crop were recorded between December 1997 and November 2002. Most reports (74%) concerned damage in January, February or March. 2. Damage mainly occurred in fields adjacent to woodland, but there was no evidence of selection between different grassland types. The severity of damage was assessed and potential options for reducing damage in the future are suggested.
