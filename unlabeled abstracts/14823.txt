Drosophilids (Diptera) from Mayotte island: an annotated list of species collected in 2013 and comments on the colonisation of Indian Ocean Islands
The Indian Ocean Islands are a most interesting region for evolutionary studies of terrestrial organisms and, among insects, the Drosophilidae family occupies a privileged position. The Comoros archipelago was, up to now, the least explored place among all the islands. We present here the results of a collection on one of the four main islands, Mayotte. From 4500 collected flies, 25 species were distinguished. The biology, ecology and biogeography of each species are discussed. Considering the extant known species from all islands, five evolutionary scenarios are proposed, ranging from the invasive, cosmopolitan, man-transported species to endemic species restricted to a single island. Some species raise a puzzling problem: despite having a very narrow and specialised ecological niche, they are broadly distributed on most islands and also on the African mainland.
