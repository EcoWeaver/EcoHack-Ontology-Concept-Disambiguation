What pollinates Lantana camara in the mountains of Costa Rica?
Lantana camara L. (Verbenaceae) is a shrub of Neotropical origin that has spread to at least 60 countries (Day et al. 2003), and its ability to rapidly occupy disturbed habitat has led to it being named one of the ten worst weeds on the planet (Cronk & Fuller 1995, Sharma et al. 2005). A number of traits may have contributed to its success as an invasive species. For example, L. camara increases the available soil nitrogen in otherwise nitrogen-poor ecosystems (Sharma & Raghubanshi 2009), it is extremely resilient to disturbance (Gentle & Guggin 1997a, Hiremath & Sundram 2005), it is allelopathic to native plants (Achhireddy & Singh 1984, Gentle & Duggin 1997b) and its fruits are dispersed by a variety of birds (Mandon-Dalger et al. 2004, Swarbrick et al. 1998). A potentially unappreciated aspect of L. camara biology that may also contribute to its invasiveness relates to pollination ecology.
