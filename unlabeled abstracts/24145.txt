Invasive White Sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis) Control with Herbicides, Cutting, and Flaming
AbstractWhite sweetclover is invading the Alaska glacial river floodplains and roadsides adjacent to natural areas, and control methods are needed. Chlorsulfuron, 2,4-DB, clopyralid, triclopyr, and 2,4-D controlled white sweetclover seedlings below recommended rates in the greenhouse. Biomass of established plants in the field was reduced by chlorsulfuron at recommended (17.6 g ai/ha), 1/2, and 1/4 rates and was reduced by triclopyr and 2,4-D at recommended rates (1,260 and 1,600 g ai/ha). Herbicides were more effective at reducing white sweetclover viable seed production in 2007 than in 2006. Only chlorsulfuron at 17.6 g ai/ha (recommended rate) eliminated seed production in both years. Flaming killed first-year plants, but some second-year plants resprouted and produced viable seed. Cutting at the 2.5 or 10 cm height did not control first-year plants because of regrowth, and second-year plant density and seed production was reduced by cutting at 2.5 cm but not by cutting at 10 cm.
