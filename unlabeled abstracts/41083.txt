Stage-specific overcompensation, the hydra effect, and the failure to eradicate an invasive predator
Significance Theoretical models of population dynamics have shown the counterintuitive conclusion that harvest can increase the equilibrium size of a population. These models of increases in response to mortality have been considered for fisheries harvest and removal of non-native species and can be driven by density-dependent overcompensation. This is the first controlled experimental field demonstration showing that harvest-driven overcompensation produced a 30-fold, single-year increase in the abundance of the invasive European green crab ( Carcinus maenas ), one of the world's most invasive predators. Using multiple lines of evidence, we provide both a robust demonstration of a fundamental prediction of population models in a field population and an important cautionary message for future eradication efforts for similar invasive species.
