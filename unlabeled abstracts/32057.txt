Can an invasive species compensate for the loss of a declining native species? Functional similarity of native and introduced oysters
The widespread introduction of the Pacific oyster, Magallana gigas, has raised concerns regarding its potential impact on the functioning of invaded ecosystems. Concurrently, populations of the European oyster, Ostrea edulis, are in decline. We quantified the functional role of the native oyster, O. edulis, in terms of nutrient cycling and associated infaunal biodiversity and compared it directly to that of the invading oyster, M. gigas. The presence and density of both species were manipulated in the field and we tested for differences in concentration of ammonium, phosphate, total oxidised nitrogen and silicate in pore-water; total organic nitrogen and carbon in sediment; microbial activity; chlorophyll concentration; and the assemblage structure and richness of associated benthic taxa. No differences in nutrient cycling rates or associated benthic assemblages were identified between both oyster species. Nutrient concentrations were mostly affected by differences in oyster density and their significance varied among sampling events. Our findings suggest that M. gigas could compensate for the loss of ecosystem functions performed by O. edulis in areas where native oysters have been extirpated.
