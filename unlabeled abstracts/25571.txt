DISTRIBUTION OF THE INVASIVE SPINY-CHEEK CRAYFISH (ORCONECTES LIMOSUS) IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC. PAST AND PRESENT
The American spiny-cheek crayfish, Orconectes limosus, was first introduced into European waters in 1890. The first literature record about the occurrence of O. limosus on the territory of the Czech Republic was published almost 100 years later - in 1989. The presence of this species in Czechia, however, was first recorded already in the 1960s, when crayfish were observed in the dead arms and pools adjacent to the river Elbe (Labe) in Central Bohemia. In the following few decades the spiny-cheek crayfish has spread into several larger rivers of the Elbe watershed and some of their smaller tributaries. The eastern part of the country (mostly belonging to the watershed of the river Morava) has not yet been colonised by this species. O. limosus can be found in lower reaches of a number of watercourses of a low stream order, but does not seem to penetrate far upstream in such localities. Its distribution in standing waters is largely the result of intentional human-mediated translocations. The long-term coexistence of Orconectes and native crayfish species has not yet been recorded, although both introduced and native crayfish at least occasionally come into contact. As O. limosus is a major carrier of the crayfish plague on the Czech territory, and crayfish plague outbreaks have been recently recorded, the dynamics of Orconectes invasion deserves careful monitoring in the future.
