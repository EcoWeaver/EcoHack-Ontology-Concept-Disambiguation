Effects of light intensity on morphology and physiology of exotic invasive Bidens pilosa l. and non-invasive congener Bidens bipinnata L
Wecomparedthe ability of physiological and morphological adaptations of the invasive Bidens pilosaL.and the native Bidens bipinnata L.under different light intensities (LI). The morphological and physiological characteristics of the invasiveB. pilosa were compared with B. bipinnataat 3-Light intensities(Control(100%full sunlight), 40% full sunlight and 10%full sunlight) for 64 days. Decreased LIsignificantly decreased the germination and root and shoot biomasses butsignificantlyincreased theleaf biomass of both plantspecies. Under the same LIthe invasive speciesB. pilosa higher leaf mass ratio (LMR), total leaf area (LA), relative growth rate (RGR), maximum net photosynthesis rate (Pmax), light saturation point (LSP), light compensation point (LCP) and dark respiration (Rd) and lower root mass ratio (RMR), stem mass ratio (SMR) and root mass/crown mass (R/C) than in B. bipinnata. Decrease in LIsignificantly reduced the photosynthesis efficiency of thenon-invasiveB. bipinnata compared with the invasiveB. pilosa. The higher photosynthetic response of B. pilosa to variable lighting conditions also indicated its better competitive ability. Our results providekeyinformation concerning the effects of light intensity on the growth and photosynthetic characteristics of B. pilosa andB. bipinnata and indicated that former exhibitsgreater physiological and morphological adaptation to different light intensities, which facilitates its further invasion.
