Regional features of alien macroinvertebrate invasion into the water ecosystems of the Ob River basin
The peculiarities of invasion of alien macroinvertebrates into the water bodies of the Ob river basin have been studied. It has been noted that the construction of hydropower plants and fishery management play the key role in the invasion of alien fauna. The main invasion corridors and the tendencies of long-term alterations in them have been revealed. The common and distinctive features of the alien fauna of the Ob River basin and the invasive species of large European rivers have been determined. It is shown that a considerable number of alien invertebrates have been introduced into the Ob river accidentally.
