How Reliable is the Untrained Eye in the Identification of an Invasive Species? The Case of Alien Bee-Hawking Yellow-Legged Hornet in Iberian Peninsula
Biological invasions cause great damage to native ecosystems, therefore, it is extremely important to take measures to contain the progress of existing invasions and prevent new ones. Here, we used the Species Distribution Models approach to compare two independent datasets for the invasive alien species the Yellow legged hornet in the Iberian Peninsula. One dataset compiles occurrence records gathered by expert people (e.g. environmental services' technical staff and researchers); and the other compiles occurrence records gathered by non-expert people (e.g. amateur entomologists, beekeepers). The main aim is to assess the effectiveness and reliability of the dataset managed by non-experts when comparing it to the dataset managed by experts. Our results showed a high degree of concordance and similarity between models. Thus, both datasets would have the same reliability to be used in management strategies for this species.
