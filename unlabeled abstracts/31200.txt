Complete mitogenome of the giant invasive hammerhead flatworm Bipalium kewense
We determined the sequence of the complete mitogenome of Bipalium kewense, an invasive land flat-worm with worldwide distribution. All 37 genes encoded on this 15,666-bp genome reside on the same DNA strand. Phylogenomic analyses of mitochondrial proteins from taxa of the order Tricladida associated B. kewense with another invasive species of land planarians (Obama sp.).
