Differential responses of native and exotic plant species to an invasive grass are driven by variation in biotic and abiotic factors
The impact of invasive species on community structure and function varies, yet it is difficult to predict. Different hypotheses have been proposed to predict invasive species establishment and impact on resident communities, based on characteristics of the resident community and/or environmental conditions. Invasive species, however, interact with both native and exotic species. The interaction with exotic species is important, as it can result in secondary invasion or greater impact on native species. Smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.) is a widely planted forage crop, but also a harmful invasive species in North American grasslands, yet little is known about the variability of its impact on resident communities. We ask (1) whether smooth brome has a consistent impact on community structure and function; (2) which biotic and abiotic conditions are associated with smooth brome's impact on resident communities; and (3) whether smooth brome has a similar impact on native and exotic species, and which biotic or abiotic conditions drive the interaction of smooth brome with native and exotic species.
