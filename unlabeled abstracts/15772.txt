Facilitation by nurse plants regulates community invasibility in harsh environments
The biotic resistance hypothesis states that species diversity is a barrier for plant biological invasions because alien species are more likely to find strong competitors as diversity of native plants increases. In stressful environments, however, these negative relationships could be diluted because increased physical harshness might reduce the importance of competition as a structuring force in plant communities. Nevertheless, if nurse plants facilitate other species and create more diverse vegetation patches than those found in their surroundings, the performance of invaders should be negatively related to diversity within these patches. Conversely, diversity would not regulate invasibility in the surroundings of nurses because these habitats are subjected to higher levels of environmental harshness.
