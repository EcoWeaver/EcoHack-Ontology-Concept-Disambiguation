Stream food web responses to a large omnivorous invader, Orconectes rusticus (Decapoda, Cambaridae)
We studied the effect of an invasive omnivore, the rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), on multiple trophic levels of lotic food webs in the upper Midwest, U. S. A. To assess food web effects we (1) conducted a crayfish exclusion experiment in an invaded stream, and (2) surveyed fish populations to compare abundance and diversity across eight streams representing an invasion gradient. In the invaded stream, electrified hoops were used to exclude rusty crayfish from typical food sources (leaves, periphyton, and benthic invertebrates). Breakdown of sugar maple leaves and abundance of invertebrates were measured over 38 days. Leaves in control hoops exposed to rusty crayfish decayed significantly faster (decay coefficient k = 0.1061) than leaves where crayfish were excluded (k = 0.0792). Fewer benthic invertebrates were found in control hoops compared to electric hoops. In contrast, periphyton standing stock on cobble was not altered by the exclusion of rusty crayfish. In the multi-stream survey, streams invaded by rusty crayfish had significantly lower fish abundance and biomass than non-invaded streams, although fish species richness did not differ between stream types. Our results suggest that invasion by rusty crayfish can have bidirectional effects on stream food webs by causing declines in food resources (e. g., detritus and invertebrates), thus indirectly affecting higher trophic levels (e. g., fish). Stream management and restoration strategies should include provisions for controlling or preventing invasions by large benthic consumers such as crayfish.
