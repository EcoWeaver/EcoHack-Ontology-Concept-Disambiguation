Diet assessments as a tool to control invasive species: comparison between Monk and Rose-ringed parakeets with stable isotopes
AbstractFood is a main limiting factor for most populations. As a consequence, knowledge about the diet of invasive alien species determines the design of control measures. The Monk and Rose-ringed parakeets are two typical species of successful invasive parrots that are highly appreciated by people. Although some observations suggest that Monk parakeets rely on a higher percentage of anthropogenic food than Rose-ringed parakeets, no detailed quantitative data is available. The aim of this study was to compare the diet of the two parakeets using stable isotope analysis (SIA). We performed SIA of carbon and nitrogen in feathers collected in Barcelona, Spain. We also measured isotopic ratios for potential food sources. We reconstructed the diet of parakeets using Bayesian mixing models. The two species differed in the isotopic signatures of their feathers for both d13C and d15N. Diet reconstruction showed that Monk parakeets feed mainly on anthropogenic food (41.7%), herbaceous plants (26.9%) and leaves/seeds (22.2%), while Rose-ringed parakeets feed mainly on flowers/fruits (44.1%), anthropogenic food provided in the trap located at the museum (32.4%) and leaves/seeds (23.1%). The more detailed information we can obtain from the diet of these species is useful to develop more effective control measures for their populations. The Monk parakeet may be more susceptible to control through education local residents, given the greater use of anthropogenic food in this species compared to Rose-ringed parakeet. Our conclusions also indicate that SIA is a powerful tool in providing crucial information about the diet and informing measures to control invasive species.
