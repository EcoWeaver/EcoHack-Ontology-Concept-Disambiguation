Spread of introduced Caulerpa species in macroalgal habitats
A short-term field experiment was designed to identify layers of Mediterranean macroalgal assemblage conducive to successful spread of two introduced Caulerpa species (Bryopsidales, Chlorophyta). By manipulation of species presence, three experimental assemblages were obtained: (1) encrusting algae, having removed the turf and erect species; (2) encrusting and turfing algae, having removed erect species; (3) encrusting, turfing and erect algae, that is, unmanipulated assemblages, which served as a control. Fragments of the two introduced species Caulerpa taxifolia (Vahl) C. Agardh and Caulerpa racemosa (Forsskal) J. Agardh were transplanted in each of the three assemblages. Width of the colony, blade density and percentage of the substratum covered by the two species were measured.The susceptibility of the indigenous community to the spread of Caulerpa species was related to type of assemblage. Blade density and amount of substratum covered by the two Caulerpa species were different between species and generally greater for C. taxifolia than for C. racemosa. Overall, the spread of these species was strongly dependent on the type but not directly on the complexity of the assemblage. Turf was more favourable than encrusting species alone, while the least advantageous habitat was where the macroalgal assemblage is composed of encrusting, turf and erect species. In other words, increased number of species in the assemblage reduces invasion of the Caulerpa species but the type of algae in the assemblage is likely to be more important than number of species. The presence of turf promotes the spread of Caulerpa species.
