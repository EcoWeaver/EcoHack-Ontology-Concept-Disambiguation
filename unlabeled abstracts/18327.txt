A new record forBemisia tabaci(Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) species complex of Turkey
In this study, species complex of Turkish Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) populations was determined by PCR-based DNA analysis. According to phylogenetic analyses, the B. tabaci samples have been identified within three generic groups. A major part of the samples belonged to two invasive species, either Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) or Mediterranean (MED). In addition to these two invasive species, several samples collected from greenhouses and cotton fields have been found to be related to Middle East-Asia Minor 2 (MEAM2), which is the first record of Turkish B. tabaci species complex.
