Nocturnal activity patterns of the monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides) in native and exotic habitats
Dromiciops gliroides is an arboreal nocturnal marsupial. We used camera traps to monitor its activity in native forest and eucalyptus plantations with native understory for 2 summers. We obtained 2.75 records camera-1 month-1 in the forest and 2.16 in the plantation. Activity period ranged from 1900 to 0700 h, but reached its peak around 0200 h. Activity patterns were variable among months, but there were no significant differences between native and eucalyptus habitats, which overlapped between 55% and 97%. It is remarkable to have found D. gliroides in habitats dominated by exotic trees, because this species has been considered to be restricted to native forests.
