Lantana camara L.: a weed with great light-acclimation capacity
Plant invasions may be limited by low radiation levels in ecosystems such as forests. Lantana camara has been classified among the world's 10 worst weeds since it is invading many different habitats all around the planet. Morphological and physiological responses to different light fluxes were analyzed. L. camara was able to acclimate to moderately shaded environments, showing a high phenotypic plasticity. Morphological acclimation to low light fluxes was typified by increasing leaf size, leaf biomass, leaf area index and plant height and by reduced stomatal density and leaf thickness. Plants in full sunlight produced many more inflorescences than in shaded conditions. Physiological acclimation to low radiation levels was shown to be higher stomatal conductance, higher net photosynthetic rates and higher efficiency of photosystem II (PSII). L. camara behaves as a facultative shade-tolerant plant, being able to grow in moderately sheltered environments, however its invasion could be limited in very shady habitats. Control efforts in patchy environments should be mainly directed against individuals in open areas since that is where the production of seeds would be higher and the progress of the invasion would be faster.
