Interactions between Two Biological Control Agents and an Herbicide for Canada Thistle (Cirsium arvense) Suppression
AbstractWe investigated the single and combined effects of two biological control agents, the stem-mining weevilHadroplontus lituraand the pathogenPseudomonas syringaepv.tagetis, with a herbicide (reduced or full application of glyphosate: 0.63 kg ae ha-1, or 3.78 kg ae ha-1, respectively) on the growth of Canada thistle,Cirsium arvense. We hypothesized that first, although each control method would have a negative effect on Canada thistle shoot biomass, root biomass, and shoot number, the integration of more than one control method would have greater impact than individual control methods. Second, we hypothesized that the order in which control methods are applied affects the outcome of the management program, with a pathogen application following weevil infestation being more effective than one prior to it. Although control methods impacted Canada thistle growth (P < 0.001, expect for a nonsignificant impact of glyphosate on shoot number), the combined effect of the three control methods behaved, generally, in an additive manner. A marginal interaction between the pathogen and the herbicide (P = 0.052) indicated a slight antagonistic interaction between these control methods. An interaction between the two biological control agents tested (P < 0.001) indicated that application of a pathogen prior to the release of weevil larvae could be more deleterious to Canada thistle than a late application. The observed, mostly additive, relationship between biological control agents and herbicides implies that integrating control methods rather than using a single approach could lead to greater Canada thistle control.
