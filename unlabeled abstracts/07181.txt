Novel and major QTL for branch angle detected by using DH population from an exotic introgression in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.).
Key message: A high-density SNP map was constructed and several novel QTL for branch angle across six environments in Brassica napus were identified. Branch angle is a major determinant for the ideotype of a plant, while the mechanisms underlying this trait in Brassica napus remain elusive. Herein, we developed one doubled haploid population from a cross involving one Capsella bursa-pastoris derived B. napus intertribal introgression line with the compressed branches and wooden stems, and constructed a high-density SNP map covering the genetic distance of 2242.14 cM, with an average marker interval of 0.73 cM. After phenotypic measurements across six environments, the inclusive composite interval mapping algorithm was conducted to analyze the QTL associated with branch angle. In single-environment analysis, a total of 17 QTL were detected and mainly distributed on chromosomes A01, A03, A09 and C03. Of these, three major QTL, qBA.A03-2, qBA.C03-3 and qBA.C03-4 were steadily expressed, each explaining more than 10% of the phenotypic variation in at least two environments. Compared with other results on rapeseed branch angle, these major QTL were newly detected. In QTL by environment interactions (QEI) mapping, 10 QTL were identified, and the QTL average effect and QEI effect were estimated. Of these, 7 QTL were detected in both single-environment analysis and QEI mapping. Based on the physical positions of SNPs and the functional annotation of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, 27 genes within the QTL regions were selected as candidate genes, including early auxin-responsive genes, small auxin-up RNA, auxin/indoleacetic acid and gretchenhagen-3. These results may pave the way for deciphering the genetic control of branch angle in B. napus.
