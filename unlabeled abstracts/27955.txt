Diet composition of introduced bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, in the Mizorogaike Pond of Kyoto, Japan
I analyzed stomach contents of the American bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, in the Mizorogaike Pond of Kyoto, Japan. As a result, adult bullfrogs were found to feed predominantly on crayfish, and juveniles eat diverse arthropods. A wide variety of aquatic organisms occurred in the diet of both adult and juvenile bullfrogs.
