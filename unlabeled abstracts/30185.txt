Using the literature to evaluate parasitoid host ranges: a case study of Macrocentrus grandii (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) introduced into North America to control Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)
We propose a method for using the literature to evaluate host ranges of parasitoids that are candidates for biological control introductions. Data on the parasitoids that attack a given host species can be used as negative evidence concerning the candidate whose host range is being evaluated. By compiling studies for a variety of host species, one can delineate those taxa unlikely to be attacked by the candidate. Using a retrospective case study of a parasitoid introduced into North America, we describe (1) this approach to using the literature to evaluate host range and (2) how well predictions based on such an evaluation match actual host range. Based on the host range of Macrocentrus grandii in Eurasia as reported in the literature, we predicted that the species in the genus Ostrinia are the most likely hosts. Of native North American species, Ostrinia obumbratalis is the only non-target species likely to be attacked by M. grandii. The predicted host range for North America matched the actual host range found in the field. This suggests that a careful literature review could be used as an important source of data on host range of parasitoid species proposed for introduction into a new environment.
