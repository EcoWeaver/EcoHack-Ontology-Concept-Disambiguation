The conservation paradox of endangered and invasive species
Ecologists are increasingly likely to encounter competing conservation priorities for the same taxa: namely imperiled species that also have non-native populations. This overlap can arise when a non-native species is established in a novel location, but is at the same time endangered within its native range. This creates a difficult philosophical paradox in which conservation efforts toward protecting the endangered species can conflict with the protection of the invaded ecosystem and its compliment of native taxa.This article is protected by copyright.
