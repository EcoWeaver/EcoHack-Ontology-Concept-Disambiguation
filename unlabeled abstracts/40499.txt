New Alien Species Mytilopsis Leucophaeata and Corbicula Fluminalis (Mollusca, Bivalvia) Recorded in Georgia and Notes on Other Non-Indigenous Molluscs Invaded the South Caucasus
Abstract First records of invasive bivalve freshwater mollusc species Mytilopsis leucophaeata (Conrad, 1831) and Corbicula fluminalis (O. F. Muller, 1774) in Georgia are reported. No native or alien extant dreissenid species have ever been recorded form this region so far. A finding of C. fluminalis in Georgia is also a new record for the country though this species inhabits the rivers of adjacent Azerbaijan. Apart from two mentioned bivalve molluscs three non-indigenous gastropod species are registered from Georgia: freshwater Ferrisia californica (Rowell, 1863) and Physella acuta (Draparnaud, 1805) and land snail Eobania vermiculata (O. F. Muller, 1774).
