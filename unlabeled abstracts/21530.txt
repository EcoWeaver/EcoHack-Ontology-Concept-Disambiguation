Potential of the invasive colonial ascidian, Didemnum vexillum, to limit escape response of the sea scallop, Placopecten magellanicus
Didemnum vexillum is a globally invasive species and a major pest to the aquaculture industry. Like other colonial ascidians, D. vexillum can readily overgrow aquaculture nets and cultured species. Recently, the species has been found in great abundance on seafloor habitats, where it is often associated with commercially important shellfish species such as sea scallops, Placopecten magellanicus. Despite the increasing abundance of D. vexillum in areas that are regularly fished for sea scallops, little work has been conducted on the ascidians impact on scallop behavior. This study examined the effect of overgrowth of the sea scallop by D. vexillum using four measures: time to initial exhaustion, swimming speed, horizontal and vertical displacement. Scallops covered by D. vexillum became exhausted more quickly, and were not able to swim as far in either the horizontal or vertical direction as the control sea scallops without D. vexillum encrustation. The expansion of D. vexillum into sea scallop habitat may increase the vulnerability of sea scallops to predation and limit their ability to access food rich habitats.
