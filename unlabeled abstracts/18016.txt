New alien barnacles in the Azores and some remarks on the invasive potential of Balanidae
Global homogenization of biota is underway through worldwide introduction and establishment of non-indigenous (exotic) species. Organisms fouling ship hulls are continually in transit and can affect communities through biodiversity loss and serious damage to economy and public health. In the Azores, for the first time, underwater alien species prospection was conducted in marinas and recreational harbours, at Sao Miguel Island. Populations of three locally previously unknown barnacle species were found: Amphibalanus amphitrite , Amphibalanus eburneus and Perforatus perforatus . These species account for the more than 50% of alien barnacles worldwide that belong to Balanidae family. Hence, some considerations about morphology and life cycle of this family are advanced, discussed and related to their invasive potential.
