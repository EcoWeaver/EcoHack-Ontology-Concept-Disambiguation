Population ecology parameters and biomass of golden grey mullet (Liza aurata) in Iranian waters of the Caspian Sea
This paper examines the changes in the population ecology parameters and biomass of golden grey mullet (Liza aurata) in Iranian waters of the Caspian Sea from 1991 to 2005. For most years during this 14-year period, we estimated the age structure of the catch, length-weight relationship, von Bertalanffy growth parameters, condition factor, natural and fishing mortality and biomass. Growth parameters were estimated as L = 62.7 cm, K = 0.15 year-1, t0 = -0.23 year-1. The instantaneous coefficient of natural mortality was estimated as 0.350 year-1 and the instantaneous coefficient of fishing mortality varied during the 14-year period between 0.111 to 0.539 year-1. Biomass estimates of golden grey mullet, from the biomass-based cohort analysis were increased from 13,527 mt in 1991-1992 to 23,992 mt in 2002-2003. In 2004-2005, it was estimated to be 23,658 mt. We concluded that at the present time, the stock of golden grey mullet is not being over-fished.
