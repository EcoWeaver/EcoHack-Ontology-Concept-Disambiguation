The Mysidae (Crustacea: Peracarida: Mysida) in fresh and oligohaline waters of the Mediterranean. Taxonomy, biogeography, and bioinvasion
A census of Mysidae yielded a total of twelve species plus two non-nominotypical subspecies found so far in fresh and oligohaline waters of the Mediterranean, all belonging to the subfamily Mysinae. Among the nine species in fresh-waters, three are stenoendemics, namely of a single lake (Diamysis lacustris), of two neighbouring river systems (Paramysis kosswigi) or of karstic cave waters (Troglomysis vjetrenicensis). Four species--T. vjetrenicensis, D. lacustris, D. fluviatilis, and Paramysis adriatica sp. nov. described in this paper--are confined to freshwater tributaries of the Adriatic Sea (NE-Mediterranean). This strengthens previous findings about the outstanding role of the Adriatic basin for the endemic diversity of freshwater Mysidae within the Mediterranean. This is possibly related to alternating marine and freshwater-terrestrial phases during the Pliocene-Pleistocene in this semi-enclosed basin. Based on current knowledge, freshwater populations of D. mesohalobia heterandra are also confined to the Adriatic basin; this taxon, however, shows many more populations in brackish waters of the E-Mediterranean and Marmora basins. Two freshwater species (Limnomysis benedeni, Hemimysis anomala) are wide-range invaders of Ponto-Caspian origin, with recent expansion into fresh and brackish waters of the NW-Mediterranean. A further immigrant to this part of the Mediterranean, Neomysis integer, is of NE-Atlantic origin and occurs only marginally in fresh-water.
