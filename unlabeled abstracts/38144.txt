Scrobipalpa atriplicella(Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), an invasive insect attacking quinoa (Amaranthaceae) in North America
AbstractQuinoa,Chenopodium quinoaWilldenow (Amaranthaceae), cultivation has expanded beyond its historical range in South America into Europe and North America due to its high nutritional properties for human consumption. With the introduction of a crop into a novel range comes the potential for insect pest issues. Here, using traditional morphology and DNA barcoding we identify larvae ofScrobipalpa atriplicella(von Roslerstamm) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), an introduced Eurasian moth, feeding on quinoa throughout the Prairie region of western Canada. Larvae can feed within the stem, on foliage, and directly on seed within the panicles, which can result in up to a 100% yield loss. We summarise distinguishing adult characteristics, potential host plants, and give initial remarks on the life cycle of this moth and its known host range in Canada. The potential for high yield losses makes further investigation ofS. atriplicellaa priority to maintain and expand sustainable quinoa production in Canada.
