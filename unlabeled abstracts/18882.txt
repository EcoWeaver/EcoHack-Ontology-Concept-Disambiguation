Mysis in the Okanagan Lake food web: a time-series analysis of interaction strengths in an invaded plankton community
Mysis introductions to the lakes of western North America have shown they are important predators on zooplankton, especially daphnids, and intercept energy flows that would otherwise be available to pelagic fishes. However, understanding of the ecological roles of Mysis within invaded communities following their establishment remains weak. We analyzed zooplankton and phytoplankton data collected from Okanagan Lake, British Columbia, within a time-series framework to evaluate the strength of ecological interactions between Mysis and the other dominant plankton. Top-down effects of Mysis in the plankton community were only detected on cyclopoid copepods and cyanophytes. Mysis dynamics were mostly driven by bottom-up effects from diatoms and from small cladocerans whose dynamics were driven primarily by the abundance of edible phytoplankton. This result supports the growing appreciation of the importance of omnivory in mysids and was consistent between the two main basins of the lake. We also analyzed published stable C and N isotope data from the plankton of Okanagan Lake with an isotope mixing model to estimate the relative importance of various potential energy sources to Mysis. This analysis supported the time-series results suggesting the importance of diatoms and small zooplankton to Mysis. However, the isotopes also suggested important resource flows from Daphnia to Mysis, an interaction not detected in the time-series analysis. Taken together, these results suggest that Mysis is a strong interactor in the Okanagan Lake food web, relying in part on energy flow through Daphnia. However, subsidies from diatoms likely decouple seasonal Mysis population dynamics from the seasonal population dynamics of Daphnia.
