Taxonomic and genomic characterization of Sporosarcina cyprini sp. nov., moderately tolerant of Cr+6 and Cd+2 isolated from the gut of invasive fish Cyprinus carpio var. communis (Linn., 1758)
A Gram-stain-positive, motile, and rod-shaped bacterium, designated as strain MB25T, was isolated from the gut of Cyprinus carpio from the highly polluted river Yamuna, India. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain MB25T belonged to the genus Sporosarcina, sharing the highest sequence similarity with S. luteola Y1T (98.98%) and S. koreensis S-K12T (98.91%). Digital DNA-DNA hybridization and average nucleotide identity values of strain MB25T with strain Y1T and S-K12T were 18.9, 77.69, and 18.2, 76.80 respectively. Genome analysis of strain MB25T revealed its biotechnological properties such as tolerance to potent heavy metals, genes for the production of carbohydrate-active enzymes, antimicrobial compounds, and also degradation of aromatic compounds. The G + C content of strain MB25T genome was 45%. Growth observed at 10-40 degC (optimum, 28-30 degC), pH 6.0-8.5 (optimum pH 7.5-8.0); NaCl concentrations up to 6.0% (w/v). The dominant respiratory quinone was MK-7, cell wall peptidoglycan is of the A-4 type containing amino acids Lys-Glu and the major fatty acids are anteiso-C11:0 and iso-C15: 0. The major polar lipids of strain MB25T are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylethanolamine. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic, and phylogenomic data, strain MB25T represents a novel species of the genus Sporosarcina, for which the name Sporosarcina cyprini sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MB25T (= MCC 4366 T = JCM 34521 T = CCM 9113 T).
