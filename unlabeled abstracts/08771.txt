Photopolymerized Network Polysiloxane Films with Dangling Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Chains for the Biofouling Release of Invasive Marine Serpulid Ficopomatus enigmaticus.
Novel photo-polymerized network films based on a polysiloxane matrix containing varied amounts of polyoxyethylene (P3) and/or perfluorohexylethyl (F) dangling side chains were investigated. For films containing less than 10 wt% P3 and F the wettability and elastic modulus were similar to those of the photo-polymerized network matrix. However, angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements proved that the surface of films with F dangling chains was highly enriched in fluorine, depending on both the amount of P3 and F and their relative ratio in the films. The biological performance of the films was evaluated against a new widespread and invasive marine biofoulant, the serpulid Ficopomatus enigmaticus. The diatom Navicula salinicola was also assayed, as aconventional model organism for comparison. Films richer in P3 better resisted the settlement and promoted the release of calcified tubeworms of F. enigmaticus.
