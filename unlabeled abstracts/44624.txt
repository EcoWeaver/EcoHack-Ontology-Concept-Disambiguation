Datura innoxia Mill. (Solanaceae), a new alien species in the flora of Bosnia and Herzegovina
Downy thorn-apple Datura innoxia Mill is native in southwest U.S.A. and Mexico. It has been recorded as a new alien species to the vascular flora of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, D. innoxia is reported from two localities in the city of Mostar where the species has escaped cultivation and established small populations in surrounding ruderal habitats including waste land. The species is toxic to animals and humans. The paper presents a short morphological characteristic and photographs as well as the distribution of the species in the Bosnia and Herzegovina.
