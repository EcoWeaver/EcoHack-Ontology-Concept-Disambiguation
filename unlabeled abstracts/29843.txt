Worming its way into Patagonia: an integrative approach reveals the cryptic invasion by Eulalia clavigera (Annelida: Phyllodocidae)
A phyllodocid polychaete belonging to the genus Eulalia is reported from Nuevo Gulf, Patagonia (South-western Atlantic Ocean) with abundant populations thriving in the intertidal zone. Morphological and molecular data allowed assigning this population to Eulalia clavigera (Audouin & Milne-Edwards, 1834), a species typically occurring along the north-eastern Atlantic coast. The absence of genetic structuring between north-eastern and south-western Atlantic E. clavigera strongly supports a non-native origin of the Patagonian population. Conversely, the majority of the Mediterranean Eulalia cf. clavigera analysed in this study turned out to belong to a different, probably undescribed species, suggesting that the diversity and taxonomy of green Eulalia is more complex than previously supposed. The high adaptation capabilities to stressed environments showed by E. clavigera, along with its possible high impact on native assemblages through predation, compel to carefully monitor its spread along the Patagonian coasts.
