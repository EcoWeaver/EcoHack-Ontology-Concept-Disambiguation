A new range-extending record of the invasive sea squirt Styela clava in the north of Scotland
A new record of an individual of the invasive sea squirt, Styela clava , is reported from Scapa Flow in Orkney, Scotland. This represents a 1.54deg latitudinal extension (168 km) from the previous northern-most record in UK waters. Diver surveys of hard substrates in the immediate area, part of local biosecurity protocols, did not find any additional individuals. Possible transport vectors, likelihood of an established reproductively active population, and implications to local biodiversity are discussed.
