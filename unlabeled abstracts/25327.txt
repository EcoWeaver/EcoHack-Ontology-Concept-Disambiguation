Flora and lepidoptera fauna adversely affected by invasive Lupinus polyphyllus along road verges
An increasing number of invasive species are changing ecosystems around the world. Road verges have commonly become the first footholds of non-native species in the new environments. Regularly mown road verges also offer habitats for meadow flora and fauna, which in Europe have suffered from the radical decline of semi-natural biotopes due to the agricultural modernization. We studied impacts of an invasive plant Lupinus polyphyllus on the plant and Lepidoptera species composition along road verges. The plant species composition was studied on 15 sites (with 1 m2 quadrats) and butterflies and diurnal moths along 15 transects (with weekly censuses) in SE Finland, each site and transect representing equally lupine invaded verge and an adjacent non-lupine verge. The species richness and diversity of flora and the cover and species richness of low growing (<20 cm) species, in particular, was lower in lupine verges compared to non-lupine verges. Also, the abundance of butterflies was lower in lupine verges. As the lupine cover approached 100%, fewer butterflies were observed in lupine transects compared to the adjacent non-lupine transects and a higher proportion of individuals were flying. Our results suggest that the changes in plant species assemblages and lower plant species richness in lupine invaded areas had "bottom-up" effects on higher trophic levels. Further studies on the control of lupine are urgently needed, but meanwhile we suggest regular mowing before the lupines have shed their seeds, together with the removal of the cuttings, to be the best management option.
