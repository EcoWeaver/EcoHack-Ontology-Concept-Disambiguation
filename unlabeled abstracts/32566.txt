Rapid Loss of Resistance to Satyrization in Invasive Mosquitoes and the Effects of Age on Interspecific Mating Frequency
In several areas where Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) have come in contact following successful invasions, Ae. aegypti have been rapidly displaced by Ae. albopictus. Recent work has confirmed that mating interference, in the form of satyrization, is likely a driving factor in these competitive displacements. However, in sites of sympatry, Ae. aegypti females evolve resistance to satyrization, and in the laboratory, satyrization-susceptible Ae. aegypti can evolve resistance within a few generations of cage exposure to Ae. albopictus. The resistance trait may be costly to maintain, as satyrization-resistant females have been shown to invest more time in mate selection. Here, we show that increased satyrization-resistance does not persist in the absence of satyrization pressure, confirming a cost to maintaining this trait. Ae. aegypti lines that had been previously selected for increased satyrization-resistance demonstrated rapid decreases in this trait over eight generations. Support for the hypothesis that condition-dependent mate preferences lead to variation in mating choice among individuals of differing quality within a population has been accumulating. Here we examine how age-related changes in reproductive effort or reproductive value may result in age-dependent mate choice. We hypothesize that older, lower quality individuals may be more likely to accept a subpar mating, in this case an interspecific mating. Our results demonstrate that mosquito age significantly affects interspecific mating rates with older mosquitoes (male and female) engaging in interspecific mating more frequently than younger counterparts (26.32 vs 9.41%). We discuss the possibility of age-related signal variation causing the breakdown of mating barriers with age.
