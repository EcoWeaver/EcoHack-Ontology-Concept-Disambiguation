Parent tree distance-dependent recruitment limitation of native and exotic invasive seedlings in urban forests
Urban forests are more vulnerable to exotic species invasions than naturalforests and are often a pathway for exotic invasions into natural areas. Investigating themechanisms responsible for species coexistence in urban ecosystems is important toprevent forest invasions and conserve native biodiversity. In this experiment, we studiedseedling recruitment for two exotic invasive (Acer platanoidesandRhamnus cathartica)and two native tree species (Acer saccharumandBetula papyrifera)intwourbanforests.We measured the effects of distance from a mature tree on the growth of conspecificseedlings and their belowground interactions (mutualisms and pathogens). We expectedthat native seedlings growing in close proximity to a mature conspecific tree would morelikely be damaged by co-specific pathogens than those growing further away. In contrast,considering that exotic invaders have not coevolved with the local soil pathogens, distancefrom the adult conspecific tree would not affect their seedlings. We collected undisturbedsoil cores at five incremental distances from each adult tree and grew conspecific seeds inthese cores. After three months of growth, we measured plant biomass, mycorrhizal rootcolonization and root lesions. We found that biomass increased with distance from themature conspecific tree only forA. platanoidesand no distance dependent signal wasdetected for other response variables. Our results show that distance from a conspecificmature tree may not determine exotic species invasibility in an urban forest and that,instead, this may contribute to promote native and invasive species coexistence in urbanforest systems.
