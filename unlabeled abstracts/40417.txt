Does the Invasive Predator Mnemiopsis leidyi A. Agassiz, 1868 Control Copepod Abundances in the Seine Estuary?
The indigenous ctenophore Pleurobrachia pileus (O.F. Muller, 1776) was common in the coastal waters of the English Channel in the early 1990s and showed very abundant populations in the downstream part of the Seine estuary. In 2005, the non-indigenous ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi A. Agassiz, 1868, a species native to the Western Atlantic, was reported for the first time in Europe in Norwegian fjords and in Le Havre harbour (Seine estuary, France). More recently, in 2017, both Pleurobrachia pileus and Mnemiopsis leidyi were recorded during suprabenthos and zooplankton sampling in the Seine estuary along a downstream-upstream transect. Both species show more abundant populations in May than in September. Conversely, copepods show a spatial distribution depending on the ctenophore distribution, with low copepod abundances in the downstream part of the estuary being associated with high ctenophore abundances, while high copepod abundances are recorded where ctenophores are absent or display low abundances. We propose that the intense predation of ctenophores on copepods is related to changes in hydrological conditions over the two last decades. This may explain the dramatic decline of copepod abundance in the Seine estuary, which could have a negative effect on its nursery role.
