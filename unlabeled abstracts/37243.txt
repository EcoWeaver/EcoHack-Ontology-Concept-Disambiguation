Preliminary study of dietary interactions between invading Ponto-Caspian gobies and some native fish species in the River Danube near Bratislava (Slovakia)
Dietary breadth and diet overlap were examined in two native fish species (Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis, Balon's ruffe Gymnocephalus baloni) and two invading species (round goby Neogobius melanostomus, bighead goby Neogobius kessleri) in the Middle Danube (Slovakia) at dawn and dusk over two consecutive 24-h periods in late summer 2004. Dietary breadth was narrow in all species/age classes except perch of ages 4 and 5. Dietary overlap between native fishes and the invading gobies was very high, except for age 3 perch. This high overlap was due to a preference, high in some cases, for gammarids. Our preliminary results suggest the potential for competition between the invading and native fishes, which requires further study.
