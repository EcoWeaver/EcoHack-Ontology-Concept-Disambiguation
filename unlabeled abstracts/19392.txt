Unraveling microbe-mediated interactions between mosquito larvae in a laboratory microcosm
Interspecies interactions have important impacts on communities and when multiple trophic levels are involved effects can be complex and indirect. For mosquitoes, interactions experienced as larvae affect adult attributes such as survivorship, reproductive output, and longevity, factors that can affect their ability to vector disease. We examined how larvae of two ecologically distinct mosquito species, Aedes japonicus japonicus and Culex quinquefasciatus, interact at different temperatures (17degC and 27degC) and at different relative densities. We also quantified abundances of bacteria and protozoan flagellates to uncover how changes in the microbial community affect the outcome of the two mosquitoes' interaction. At 17degC, survival and size of both mosquito species was not affected by the other's presence. Cx. quinquefasciatus was strongly affected by intraspecific, but not interspecific, competition at both temperatures. At 27degC, Ae. j. japonicus larvae experienced 100% mortality in treatments by themselves and treatments where Cx. quinquefasciatus was abundant, surviving only in the presence of low densities of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Both the total bacteria count and counts of a protozoan flagellate identified as Spumella spp. decreased with increasing numbers of Cx. quinquefasciatus. We postulate that at 27degC, the survival of Ae. j. japonicus depends on the interaction between Cx. quinquefasciatus and the microbial community. This study demonstrates that one mosquito species may alter the microbial community in ways that indirectly influence another mosquito species' larval survival, and by extension adult abundance and disease transmission.
