Observations of herbivore attack on garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) in Southwestern Ontario, Canada
We have observed what appears to be the first significant report of herbivory of a population of Alliaria petiolata (M. Bieb.) Cavara & Grande (Garlic Mustard) in Canada. Ceutorhynchus erysimi Fabr., Plutella xylostella L. (Diamondback Moth), and Philaenus spumarius (Meadow Spittlebug) were identified attacking, and successfully proceeding through different stages of development on A. petiolata. From the field observations, we hypothesize that these species have recognized A. petiolata as a host and therefore may be candidates for the management of the invasive species.
