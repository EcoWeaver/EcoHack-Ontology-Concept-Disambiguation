Learning and linking for invasive species management
Invasive species can create economic and safety concerns. Responding to invasive species requires communication of research, localized management, and collaboration across jurisdictional boundaries. We examined the use of adaptive comanagement in three New York counties to mitigate the impacts of emerald ash borer, a wood-boring beetle that causes widespread death of ash trees. We assessed learning along three typologies (cognitive, normative, and relational), linking (through network analysis), and connections of learning and linking to management outcomes. Findings indicate that knowledge networks were built through task forces that brought together local and state government, university, and private stakeholders. In addition, this study suggests types of learning that are needed for stakeholders to respond to invasive species management.
