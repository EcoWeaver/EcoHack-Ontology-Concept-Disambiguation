Diet quality mitigates intraspecific larval competition inDrosophila suzukii
The invasive frugivore Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae) utilizes a wide range of host plants and damages important fruit crops, including blueberries, cherries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. Field infestations of D. suzukii often exceed one larva per berry, suggesting that intraspecific competition may frequently occur. Because dietary resources are also likely to vary across the host range of D. suzukii, we designed a laboratory assay to measure larval performance across diets of varying quality: a standard artificial diet, a fruit-based medium, a low-protein, and a low-carbohydrate diet. We manipulated egg density across these diets to provide increasing levels of competition and measured larval performance by observing survival to pupation and adulthood, and development times for both life stages. Although increasing density generally negatively impacted D. suzukii performance across diets, the magnitude of these impacts varied by diet type. Drosophila suzukii performance was generally similar in fruit and standard diets, although larval development was more rapid in fruit diets at lower densities. Even at low densities (5 or 10 eggs per arena), survival was reduced and development time increased in low-protein diets relative to standard and fruit diets. At the two highest larval densities (20 or 40 eggs per arena), survivorship was reduced in low-carbohydrate diets as compared to standard and fruit diets. There is evidence that larvae compensated in both low-quality diets by extending development time, which could have consequences for population dynamics. Population models for use in D. suzukii management may need to account for both host nutritional quality and relative competition to accurately predict turnover and geographic expansion.
