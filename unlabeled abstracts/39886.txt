The invasive stink bug Halyomorpha halys affects the reproductive success and the experience-mediated behavioural responses of the egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis
Invasive species, because of their lack of co-evolutionary history with recipient communities, can act as "evolutionary traps" causing disconnects between natural enemy behavioural responses and the suitability of the invasive species as a prey/host resource. Invasion of exotic species in non-native environments may have several ecological effects, including consequences for the experience-mediated behavioural responses of indigenous foragers. Experience is usually thought to help resident species to buffer against negative impacts of new invasive species, including escaping from evolutionary traps. Here we hypothesized that the impact of foraging experience depends on whether an indigenous egg parasitoid can correctly assess the resource suitability of a new invasive species for offspring development. We showed that the invasive stink bug Halyomorpha halys acts as an evolutionary trap for the indigenous egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis leading to unsuccessful development of ~ 95% of the eggs laid in this host species. In a mixed scenario in which the associated resident stink bug Nezara viridula co-occurs with the invasive H. halys, we showed that oviposition experience in the low quality invasive host induces in T. basalis similar responses to those of the associated host. These results suggest that foraging experience does not lead to avoidance of an evolutionary trap. We discuss parasitoid foraging experience and reproductive success in the light of the evolutionary trap framework with implication for biological control.
