Frog alien species: a way for genetic invasion?
European water frogs are characterized by anthropic introductions and Rana ridibunda may be considered as an invasive species. As such translocations may result in introgression of exotic genes in native populations, i.e. genetic pollution, we studied genetic characteristics (on 11 allozymic loci) of natural versus introduced water frogs. Our study contributed to (1) disclose 3 genetic markers allowing the identification of exotic frogs; (2) quantify the proportion of exotic frogs found in natural populations; and (3) suggest how genetic pollution may arise in these frogs.
