Species evenness and invasion resistance of experimental grassland communities
Concern for biodiversity loss coupled with the accelerated rate of biological invasions has provoked much interest in assessing how native plant species diversity affects invasibility. Although experimental studies extensively document the effects of species richness on invader performance, the role of species evenness in such studies is rarely examined. Species evenness warrants more attention because the relative abundances of species can account for substantially more of the variance in plant community diversity and tend to change more rapidly and more frequently in response to disturbances than the absolute numbers of species. In this study, we experimentally manipulated species evenness within native prairie grassland mesocosms. We assessed how evenness affected primary productivity, light availability and the resistance of native communities to invasion. The primary productivity of native communities increased significantly with species evenness, and this increase in productivity was accompanied by significant decreases in light availability. However, evenness had no effect on native community resistance to invasion by three common exotic invasive species. In this study, niche complementarity provides a potential mechanism for the effects of evenness on productivity and light availability, but these effects apparently were not strong enough to alter the invasibility of the experimental communities. Our results suggest that species evenness enhances community productivity but provides no benefit to invasion resistance in otherwise functionally diverse communities.
