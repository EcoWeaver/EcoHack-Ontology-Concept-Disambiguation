Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) as an invader and threat to biodiversity in arid environments: A review
Popular pastoral species, Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) is receiving long overdue attention as an invasive weed that poses serious threats to biodiversity conservation worldwide. Most research focuses on the species as forage plant and is largely published in agricultural and grey literature. Meanwhile, there is a dearth of information about the species ecology in natural landscapes despite strong evidence from field workers and managers that the species is an aggressive invader and threat to biodiversity in many environments. We present a comprehensive review of the ecology, distribution and biodiversity impacts of Buffel grass when behaving as an invasive species. Foundations are laid for research into localised habitat requirements of the species that will aid in the management of Buffel grass invasions now and into the future.
