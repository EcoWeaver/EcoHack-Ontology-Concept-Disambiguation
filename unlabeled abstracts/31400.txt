Hannibal Gone Astray? A Critical Comment on W. C. Mahaney et al.: 'The Traversette (Italia) Rockfall: Geomorphological Indicator of the Hannibalic Invasion Route' (Archaeometry, 52, 1 [2010] 156-72)
For a long time now, historians have considered the way across the Col de Clapier as the most likely invasion route of Hannibal's army across the Alps. Mahaney et al. challenge this view by introducing a two-tier rockfall into the discussion, which they believe is mentioned in the ancient texts and has gone unnoticed by modern scholars. Since a deposit of this kind can only be found at the Col de la Traversette--and there alone--Hannibal's crossing of the Alps, so they reason, must have followed this alternative route. However, a critical reassessment of the ancient texts and a closer look at the geomorphological situation clearly show that this interpretation is unwarranted.
