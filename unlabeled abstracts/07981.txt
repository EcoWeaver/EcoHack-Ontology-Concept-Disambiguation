Marine invasions enter the genomic era: three lessons from the past, and the way forward.
The expanding scale and increasing rate of marine biological invasions has been documented since the early 20th century. Besides their global ecological and economic impacts, non-indigenous species (NIS) also have attracted much attention as opportunities to explore important eco-evolutionary processes such as rapid adaptation, long-distance dispersal and range expansion, and secondary contacts between divergent evolutionary lineages. In this context, genetic tools have been extensively used in the past twenty years. Three important issues appear to have emerged from such studies. First, the study of NIS has revealed unexpected cryptic diversity in what had previously been assumed homogeneous entities. Second, there has been surprisingly little evidence of strong founder events accompanying marine introductions, a pattern possibly driven by large propagule loads. Third, the evolutionary processes leading to successful invasion have been difficult to ascertain due to faint genetic signals. Here we explore the potential of novel tools associated with High-Throughput DNA Sequencing (HTS) to address these still pressing issues. Dramatic increase in the number of loci accessible via HTS has the potential to radically increase the power of analyses aimed at species delineation, exploring the population genomic consequences of range expansions, and examining evolutionary processes such as admixture, introgression, and adaptation. Nevertheless, the value of this new wealth of genomic data will ultimately depend on the ability to couple it with expanded "traditional" efforts, including exhaustive sampling of marine populations over large geographic scales, integrated taxonomic analyses, and population level exploration of quantitative trait differentiation through common-garden and other laboratory experiments.
