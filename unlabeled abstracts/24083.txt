Mate-location failure, the Allee effect, and the establishment of invading populations
In recent years, increased global trade and travel have provided potent invasion pathways for ever-increasing numbers of alien species. Although many species from distant parts of the world have increased productivity and taken on critical roles in agriculture, horticulture, forestry, and aquacultural industries, many other alien species have had serious deleterious effects on these same industries as well as on human health (Pimentel et al. 2000). Additionally, invasions by many non-indigenous species are known to negatively affect important ecological processes and properties in a variety of natural ecosystems (Mack et al. 2000; McNeely et al. 2001). The immense impacts of invading species provide ample motivation for undertaking measures to prevent more species from establishing. Though prevention of the arrival of new species is often a desirable option, it may not always be possible to shut down all invasion pathways (Lodge et al. 2006).
