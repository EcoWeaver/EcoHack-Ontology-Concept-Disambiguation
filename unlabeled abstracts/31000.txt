A comparison of prokaryotic symbiont communities in nonnative and native ascidians from reef and harbor habitats
Harbor systems represent passive gateways for the introduction of nonnative ascidians that compete with the surrounding benthos and may spread through localized dispersal, even populating adjacent natural reefs. To investigate the potential role of microbial symbionts in the success of ascidian introductions and spread, we evaluated the host-specificity of prokaryotic communities within two ascidian species commonly found off the North Carolina coast. Replicate samples of the native ascidian Eudistoma capsulatum, the nonnative ascidian Distaplia bermudensis, and seawater were collected from artificial (harbor) and natural reef substrates. Prokaryotic communities in seawater samples and ascidian tunics were characterized via next-generation sequencing of partial 16S rRNA gene sequences. Ascidian microbiomes clustered strongly in response to host species, with significant differences in community structure between the two species and seawater. Further, symbiont community structure differed significantly between native ascidians collected from artificial and natural habitats, though this was not the case for the nonnative species. These findings suggested that nonnative species possess stable microbial symbiont communities that may allow them to thrive in a wide range of habitats, while native species rely on the restructuring of their microbial communities with specific symbionts (e.g. Chelativorans) to survive under particular environmental conditions such as increased pollution.
