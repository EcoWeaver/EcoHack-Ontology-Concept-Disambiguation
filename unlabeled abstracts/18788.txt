Invasion of quality: high amounts of essential fatty acids in the invasive Ponto-Caspian mysid Limnomysis benedeni
Resource quality for aquatic consumers is often determined by the content of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the diet. Seasonal field sampling and controlled laboratory experiments with the invasive Ponto-Caspian mysid Limnomysis benedeni revealed high amounts of PUFA, in particular eicosanoids that are important for fish nutrition. This suggests a potential trophic upgrading in the aquatic food web through the invasive mysid.
