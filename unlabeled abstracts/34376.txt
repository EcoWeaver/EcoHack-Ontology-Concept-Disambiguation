Amending Invasion With Carbon: After Fifteen Years, a Partial Success
Researcher Peter Alpert discusses how the mechanism of C addition to soil might minimize the abundance of introduced plants in grasslands in North America. The availability of nitrogen in the soils induces the growth of the human-introduced plant species in natural and seminatural systems. Nearly all studies found that C addition reduced likely availability of N to plants. The most common measurements of plant-available N were concentrations of NO 3 and NH4 in extracts of soils in KCl. Additions of C were also observed to affect the composition of soil biota. Effects of C addition on introduced species have been less consistent than those on soil N, but still mainly negative. Of the 30 studies that separately reported effects of C addition on species unambiguously identified as introduced in the context of the experimental system, 20 found generally negative effects, nine found no effect, and one found a positive effect.
