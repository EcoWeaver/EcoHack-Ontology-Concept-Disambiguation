Rediscovery of a native freshwater shrimp, Neocaridina denticulata, and expansion of an invasive species in and around Lake Biwa, Japan: genetic and morphological approach
Invasive species prevention involves avoiding two aspects: introduction and secondary spread. The latter is essential in places that can become hubs for spreading invasive species. Lake Biwa, the largest lake in Japan, is an important area for biodiversity and fisheries. However, several invasive fish and crustaceans were established in the lake last century. One of the conservation problems in the Lake Biwa region is the unresolved suspicion that the native freshwater shrimp Neocaridina denticulata have been replaced with alien Neocaridina species. To verify whether exotic species have replaced the native Neocaridina population in this region, we estimated the population structure of Neocaridina spp., collected from 19 sites in and around Lake Biwa, based on genome-wide SNPs and mitochondrial DNA. The three detected genetic clusters were characterized by quantitative analysis of multiple morphological traits. Two clusters were identified as non-native N. davidi and the other as native N. denticulata. However, species discrimination based solely on morphological analysis was difficult, highlighting the importance of genetic analysis. We rediscovered the native populations in the region for the first time in a century; however, in 11 sites, the invasive species were dominant. These findings suggest that the native populations are in a critical situation. Furthermore, fishery resource stocking throughout Japan from Lake Biwa can cause the secondary spread of the invasive shrimps from the lake, acting as a hub, to other parts of the country.
