Resistance to low oxygen in the Ponto-Caspian amphipod Pontogammarus robustoides varies among lentic habitats of its northern invaded range
The Ponto-Caspian amphipod Pontogammarus robustoides was introduced into Lithuanian inland waters more than 50 years ago and is now among the most successful local crustacean invaders. Existing as an oxyphilic species in its native range, in Lithuania it managed to establish in some lentic eutrophic waters facing long-term hypoxic conditions under winter ice cover, or shorter periods of hypoxia during the warm season. Recently, it has been observed to be further expanding in such waters. The aim of this study was to explore the possible divergence in anaerobic metabolism among introduced populations facing different selective pressures. A closed-bottle experiment was conducted using individuals from three Lithuanian lentic water bodies of different trophic status: mesotrophic, eutrophic and hypertrophic. Severe hypoxia was gradually reached, after which lactate dehydrogenase activity was significantly higher in amphipods from eutrophic and hypertrophic, than from mesotrophic environments, and was well correlated with trophic status of inhabited environments as assessed by chlorophyll a concentration. These findings suggest a physiological acclimation response to oxygen deficiency faced by the species in some environments in the northern invaded range which may have a genetic background. Such resistance to oxygen deficiency may expand the environmental niche and promote species' spread into previously unsuitable habitats, which may pose a threat to native species residing in refuges that are currently free of the invader.
