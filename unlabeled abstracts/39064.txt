Site and species selection for religious release of non-native fauna
In East and Southeast Asia, numerous non-native animal species are ceremonially released for spiritual merit (Severinghaus & Chi 1999; Yeo & Chia 2010; Liu et al. 2012; Su et al. 2016). Given the associated threat of biological invasions, such activities present a form of conservation conflict and need to be managed accordingly. Here, we propose a conservation management option for a value system that favours releasing animals for religious purposes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved
