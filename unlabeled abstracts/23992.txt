Cultural Exploitation of Freshwater Turtles in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo
We investigated the cultural exploitation of nonmarine turtles in Sarawak State, Malaysia. Turtles are primarily used for food, and the Asian softshell turtle, Amyda cartilaginea, appears to be the most desirable species. Other local demands include the pet trade, which involves both local and exotic species of turtles.
