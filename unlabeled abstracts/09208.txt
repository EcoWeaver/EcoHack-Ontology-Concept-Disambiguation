Effects of grassland extensification on the population dynamics of the invasive speciesChaerophyllum aureum
The consequences of extensification on grassland invasion by weeds was studied in French Pyrenean hay-meadows through a survey of the population dynamics of one very successful colonizer: Chaerophyllum aureum. Experiments established in natural permanent grasslands allow us to test the effect of different intensities of cutting on the demography of adult and seedling populations and on the production of seeds and their survival in soil. Although an early cut can control population density by drastically reducing invasion by new genotypes, the results reveal a positive effect of early cutting on adult and seedling survival probably by decreasing intra-specific competition. Allocation of resources to sexual reproduction in response to cutting is limited, affecting especially the seed viability in soil. Nevertheless, the invasive ability of this species is due largely to a strategy whereby those adults showing a high survival rate tend to be perennial.
