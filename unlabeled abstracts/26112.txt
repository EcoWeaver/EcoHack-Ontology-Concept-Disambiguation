Variation in Condition Factor and Growth in Young-of-Year Fishes in Floodplain and Riverine Habitats of the Cosumnes River, California
Condition factors and growth rates of postlarval (young-of-year) fishes in a Central California river were compared in order to determine the relative importance of floodplain and riverine habitats for rearing. Sampling took place between April and June of 2001 and 2002 in the lower Cosumnes River and its floodplain. Sacramento splittail showed higher condition and length increment in floodplain habitats of than in riverine habitats. Sacramento suckers showed differences in condition between sites, but suckers from the floodplain had lower weight increments than those from the river. The weight increment in Sacramento splittail was not significantly different between habitats. In addition, two alien species, common carp and golden shiner, had similar condition factors and growth rates. This study shows the usefulness of condition factor and growth rate in evaluating the importance of different habitats for early life history stages of fishes.
