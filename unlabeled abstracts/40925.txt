Invasion waves for a nonlocal dispersal predator-prey model with two predators and one prey
<p style='text-indent:20px;'>This paper is concerned with the propagation dynamics of a nonlocal dispersal predator-prey model with two predators and one prey. Precisely, our main concern is the invasion process of the two predators into the habitat of one prey, when the two predators are weak competitors in the absence of prey. This invasion process is characterized by the spreading speed of the predators as well as the minimal wave speed of traveling waves connecting the predator-free state to the co-existence state. Particularly, the right-hand tail limit of wave profile is derived by the idea of contracting rectangle.
