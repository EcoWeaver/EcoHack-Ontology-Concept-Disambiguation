Individual and reef growth of the invasive reef-building polychaete <i>Ficopomatus enigmaticus</i> in a south-western Atlantic coastal lagoon
The growth of the Ficopomatus enigmaticus reefs was measured throughout a coastal lagoon at different temporal and spatial scales (over 24 years, annually and monthly throughout the coastal lagoon). The results show that reef cover increased in the last 24 years, and many neighbouring reefs have coalesced into large platforms. Growth rate varies spatially and temporally. Small reefs grow faster than large ones. Ficopomatus enigmaticus polychaetes living in higher salinity areas show a lower biomass than those living in brackish water areas, and the same pattern was observed for the inter-ring distance measured on the tubes. The results also show that important environmental variables, including salinity, nutrient availability and environmental energy (measured as current speed and depth) may be the most important factors affecting the growth and spread of the reefs.
