Biogeomorphology: diverse, integrative and useful
Biogeomorphology is an umbrella term given to a highly-active research area within geomorphology that focusses on the many and varied interactions and feedbacks between organisms and the physical Earth. In the last 25?years this interest has developed and diversified to include the direct and indirect influences of microorganisms, plants, animals and humans on earth surface processes and landform dynamics, and the roles of geomorphology in ecological functioning, resilience and evolution. This Commentary introduces a virtual special issue of 16 research papers and 3 ?State of Science? pieces, illustrating the diversity of the field, its continued theoretical and conceptual progression, and the applied relevance of biogeomorphological science in tackling environmental problems. Collectively, these papers demonstrate the merits of?and opportunities for?biogeomorphology as an inherently integrative science in understanding and managing the complexity of living landscapes.
