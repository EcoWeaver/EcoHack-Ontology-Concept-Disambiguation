Invasive Serotype 1 Streptococcus pneumoniae Outbreaks in the South Pacific from 2000 to 2007
ABSTRACT In New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna, and French Polynesia, an active surveillance system was established to monitor pneumococcal serotype prevalence between 2000 and 2007. The most prevalent serotype was serotype 1, which belonged to the major clonal complex sequence type 306 (ST306) and was responsible for invasive pneumococcal disease outbreaks.
