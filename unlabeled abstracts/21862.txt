Regime shift in marine ecosystems and implications for fisheries management, a review
The concept of regime shift in marine ecosystems has arisen in recent years. This study reviews the origin, scientific meaning, driving forces of marine ecosystem regime shrifts. Driving forces include climate-ocean oscillation, fishing, introduced species, river flow, eutrophication, disease and pollution. Several controversial questions are discussed: whether regime shift is just a climate oscillation noise, the difficulties of separating driving forces, and whether the impacts of ecosystem regime shift are necessarily bad or good. The methods used to model regime shifts in ecosystems are reviewed. These methods include two types of models: general circulation model and historical description. The implications of regime shift in fisheries are considered, including examples of impacts, consequences of not considering regime shift, and difficulties in incorporating regime shift into the current stock assessment models. Possible future research needed to understand and model regime shifts is discussed, including strategies for fisheries management.
