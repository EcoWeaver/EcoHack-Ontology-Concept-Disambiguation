Behavioral consequences of exotic host plant adoption and the differing roles of male harassment on female movement in two checkerspot butterflies
Herbivorous insects may evolve convergent behaviors when independent adoption of a shared novel host plant places populations in environmental conditions that diverge from the ancestral state. We investigated the behavioral consequences of adopting Plantago lanceolata, an exotic species to North America, in populations of Euphydryas p. phaeton and Euphydryas editha taylori, on the east and west coasts of North America. Activity budgets and short-term movements suggested that innate species tendencies exert a greater impact on behavior than adoption of the same exotic host plant. However, female E. phaeton from a Plantago-dependent population spent more time inspecting host plants than females from a population dependent on the native host plant, Chelone glabra. Both checkerspot species had similar diffusion coefficients (D) regardless of host plant association. But, E. e. taylori step-lengths appeared bimodal and power law distributed while E. phaeton step-lengths were unimodal and best fit by an exponential distribution. We attribute this bimodal step-length distribution to the persistent harassment of courting males which induces a "long-distance" evasive flight in otherwise sedentary E. e. taylori females. In contrast, the longer distance step-lengths of E. phaeton were associated with the inspection of oviposition plants. These two checkerspot species appear to move greater distances across the reproductive landscape with contrasting motivational states that could lead to either intimate mapping (E. phaeton) or coarse mapping (E. e. taylori) of host resources.
