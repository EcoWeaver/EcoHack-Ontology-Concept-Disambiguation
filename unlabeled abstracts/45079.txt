Transcriptome analysis and screening of putative sex-determining genes in the invasive pest, Frankliniella occidentalis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae)
The invasive insect pest, Frankliniella occidentalis, is a well-known vector that transmits a variety of ornamental and vegetable viruses. The mechanistic basis of sex determination in F. occidentalis is not well understood, and this hinders our ability to deploy sterile insect technology as an integrated pest management strategy. In this study, six cDNA libraries from female and male adults of F. occidentalis (three biological replicates each) were constructed and transcriptomes were sequenced. A total of 6000 differentially-expressed genes were identified in the two sexes including 2355 up- and 3645 down-regulated genes. A total of 149 sex-related genes were identified based on GO enrichment data and included transformer-2 (tra2), fruitless (fru), male-specific lethal (msl) and sex lethal (sxl); several of these exhibited sex-specific and/or sex-biased expression in F. occidentalis. This study contributes to our understanding of the sex-determined cascade in F. occidentalis and other members of the Thysanoptera.
