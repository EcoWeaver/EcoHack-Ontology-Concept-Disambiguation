Predatory and reproductive responses of the estuarine whelk Thais gradata (Caenogastropoda: Muricidae) to novel colonization by Musculista senhousia (Bivalvia: Mytilidae)
Novel predator-prey interactions are becoming increasingly relevant to investigate in the context of current geographical range expansions and biological invasions. This study describes a vigorous attack by a muricid whelk, Thais gradata on a mud-inhabiting mytilid mussel, Musculista senhousia, following new colonization of the mussel in the Brunei estuarine system (Borneo, South-East Asia). This represents only the second reported attack by a gastropod on this globally important invasive mussel species, and the first such attack in its native environment. Whelks migrated from their typical hard surface habitat and barnacle feeding to the sediment, where they aggregated and fed on the mussels. Field data suggest no selection by the whelks of the part of the mussel bed colonized or of the prey size attacked (median shell length = 21 mm). In addition to forming feeding aggregations, the whelks formed non-feeding resting aggregations off the mussel bed (sometimes of more than 80 individuals). These apparently facilitated synchronized mating and consequently the formation of large communal nests of egg capsules (involving approximately 3500 contributing females). During the investigation, the newly-formed mussel colony underwent mass mortality, and the whelks either redistributed on the sediment or returned to feeding on barnacles. The population-level response by the whelks described here maximizes energy transfer from prey resource to whelk propagation. In addition to the whelk's generality of habitat use and feeding behaviour, this is likely to contribute to sustaining populations in a system where prey abundance and distribution is limited by highly variable and extreme physicochemical conditions.
