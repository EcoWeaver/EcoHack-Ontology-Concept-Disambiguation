Time is running out! Rapid range expansion of the invasive northern raccoon in central Italy
Abstract The northern raccoon, Procyon lotor (Linnaeus, 1758), is listed among the invasive alien species of European Union concern. Therefore, an updated monitoring of its distribution is required to design and address management actions. As to Italy, the raccoon has been reported with an established population only in northern regions. In this note, we report a new established raccoon population along the Apennine ridge in central Italy and we estimate the range expansion from 2015 to 2018 both through the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and the kernel estimates. Furthermore, we propose the management actions to limit negative impacts in the Foreste Casentinesi National Park and its surroundings.
