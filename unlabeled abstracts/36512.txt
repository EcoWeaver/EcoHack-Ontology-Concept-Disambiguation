River dynamics and invasion: distribution patterns of native and invasive woody vegetation at the Rio Negro, Argentina
AbstractSalicaceae are typical invaders of riparian ecosystems throughout the world and they have the potential to change much of the invaded habitats. Along Patagonian streams, riparian softwood forests composed of non-native Salicaceae are increasing in abundance, area and tree species diversity. Especially in the last decades, dense floodplain forests dominated by invasive willows and poplars and additionally Russian olive and tamarisk spread almost explosively e.g. along the Rio Negro in northern Patagonia. This study focuses on the identification of ecological niches and niche overlaps of the native and invasive woody species in order to assess the impact on the native Salix humboldtiana Willd. Data on species (presence/ absence) and explanatory variables were gathered in the field using a grid-based, stratified-randomized sampling design. Different environmental variables were then related to species occurrence in different life stages (adult, juvenile, seedling) using habitat distribution models. In the final models, flood duration, the amount of gravel and the location (upper or middle river valley) were included to describe the probability of occurrence of native and invasive taxa. For all life stages, a strong niche overlap could be observed for S. humboldtiana and the invasive taxa with no remaining exclusive habitats indicating a potential threat to the native willow. The study contributes to a better understanding of Salicaceae invasion and its consequences for riparian ecosystems.
