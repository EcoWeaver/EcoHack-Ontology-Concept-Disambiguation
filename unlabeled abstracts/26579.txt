Identifying Environmental Conditions to Promote Species Coexistence: An Example with the Native Barrens Topminnow and Invasive Western Mosquitofish
Coexistence of a native and invasive species may be possible at certain conditions along an environmental gradient where the individual responses of each species are maximally apart. Water temperature may differentially affect the growth of a native cool-water species like the Barrens topminnow, Fundulus julisia, and an originally warm-water adapted western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, who is a recent invader in Barrens Plateau region of middle Tennessee. We measured the specific growth rate (SGR) of the two species separately in laboratory aquaria at 10, 15, 20 and 25degC, representing a range of temperatures that occur in topminnow habitats throughout the year. Both species grew faster with increasing temperature and SGRs were highest at 25degC. The interspecific difference in SGR was maximized at 15degC. At this temperature, mean growth rate of topminnows was 0.78% per day, more than twice that of mosquitofish (0.38% per day). These results suggest that cool springhead habitats with a near-constant thermal environment of 15degC throughout the year may provide a growth advantage to the Barrens topminnow over the mosquitofish. Other environmental, density-dependent, or behavioral factors not examined here may act along with temperature to mediate the coexistence of the topminnow and mosquitofish.
