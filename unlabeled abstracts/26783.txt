Infections of the Malaria Parasite, Plasmodium Floridense, in the Invasive Lizard, Anolis Sagrei, in Florida
Florida is now home to several exotic species of amphibians and reptiles, but the most prevalent is Anolis sagrei, the Brown Anole. We surveyed 28 sites across the state for infections with the saurian malaria parasite, Plasmodium floridense between 2000 and 2006. Plasmodium floridense was found at five sites, primarily along the Gulf of Mexico coast. The results of the survey allowed for two tests of possible factors contributing to the presence of the parasite. One was a set of ecological variables as implemented in the niche modeling program Maxent. We found that proximity to fresh water and urban areas were important variables in predicting the parasite. The second test examined whether A. sagrei that had originated from western Cuban populations were less susceptible to the parasite; there was no difference in infection rates of A. sagrei from western versus eastern/central Cuban populations.
