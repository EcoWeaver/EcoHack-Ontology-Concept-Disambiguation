Effects of Management on Range Expansion by Chinese Tallow in the Forestlands of Eastern Texas
Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera [L.] Small) was the most prevalent invasive tree in the forestlands of eastern Texas in 2006. We analyzed an extensive data set collected as part of the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program of the USDA Forest Service to quantify the range expansion of Chinese tallow from 2006 to 2011. Our results indicated that the presence of Chinese tallow on sampled plots doubled during this period. Chinese tallow spread extensively toward the north. Results of multiple logistic regression, which classified 71% of the field plots correctly with regard to species presence and absence, indicated that the probability of invasion was correlated positively with mean daily minimum temperature, elevation, adjacency to water bodies, and site productivity and was correlated negatively with stand age, site preparation, artificial regeneration, and distance to the nearest road. Habitats most at risk of further invasion (likelihood of invasion >20%) under current conditions occurred primarily in northeastern Texas, with a few invasion hotspots in the South. Estimated probabilities of further invasion were reduced the most by site preparation and artificial regeneration, with habitats most at risk again occurring primarily in northeastern Texas.
