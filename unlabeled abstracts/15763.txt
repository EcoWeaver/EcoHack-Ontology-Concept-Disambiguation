Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in Asia: a re-examination of the native range and invasion to southeastern Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan
Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) is an invasive ladybird spreading in several continents. It is native to East Asia, but its range in Asia has until now been poorly understood. The most complete map of the range of Harmonia axyridis in Asia has been compiled (432 localities). Harmonia axyridis occurs in the south-east of West Siberia, the south of East Siberia, the south of Russian Far East, the east of Kazakhstan, the north of Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, China, North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and the north of Vietnam. Southeastern Kazakhstan and the north of Kyrgyzstan are not a part of the native range: the large Balkhash Desert is situated between this mountainous region and the nearest part of the native range (Altai mountains). The analysis of dates and places of findings indicates that Harmonia axyridis appeared in southeastern Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan after the construction of the Turkestan-Siberian Railway. It is hypothesized that the beetles crossed the desert along this railway.
