First records of two formerly overlooked Ponto-Caspianamphipods from Turkey: Echinogammarus trichiatus (Martynov, 1932)and Dikerogammarus villosus (Sovinsky, 1894)
So far, 13 species of Ponto-Caspian amphipods have been reported from the inland waters of Turkey. Two, probably overlooked species, Echinogammarus trichiatus and Dikerogammarus villosus, are here recorded for the first time from this country. Due to the atypical morphology, the identity of E. trichiatus was also verified with molecular methods, based on the mtDNA COI barcode. Both species, along with five other co-occurring Ponto-Caspian amphipods, were collected from the Durusu Lake in September 2007. Our finding reveals high diversity of amphipods in this water body. It also presents the southernmost known localities of both species, and extends the checklist of Ponto-Caspian amphipod fauna of Turkey to 15 species. Taking into account the geographical range of both species, we may conclude that they are native in the Durusu Lake and their presence there was formerly overlooked.
