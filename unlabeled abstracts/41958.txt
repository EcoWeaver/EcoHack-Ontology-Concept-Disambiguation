Time of Introduction of the Alien Component of the Spontaneous Illinois Vascular Flora
The current spontaneous vascular flora of Illinois consists of 811 (nearly 29%) alien species. Of the 811 species, 708 (87.3%) are herbs and 103 (12.7%) are woody plants. Four hundred and forty alien species were reported before 1922; 163 additional species between 1922-1955, and 208 more between 1956-1978. The angiosperms contain a higher percentage of alien species (29.5%) than either the gymnosperms (25%) or fern and fern allies (1.35%). In the pteridophytes there is only one family that consists totally of alien species; in the gymnosperms there are none, and in the angiosperms are 10 such families. The Poaceae and Compositae have had the greatest increase in the number of alien species between 1922 and 1978. The average number of alien species introduced into the spontaneous Illinois vascular flora per year between 1803 and 1978 is 4.6; however, the average number of introductions between 1956 and 1978 is 9.4, indicating the increased rate of alien species introductions in recent years.
