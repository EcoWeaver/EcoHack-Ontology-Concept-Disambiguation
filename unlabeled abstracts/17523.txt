Comparative feeding ecology of invasive Ponto-Caspian gobies
Invasions of Ponto-Caspian gobiid fishes are suspected to cause regime shifts in freshwater ecosystems. This study compared the trophic niche differentiations of Neogobius melanostomus and Pon-ticola kessleri in the upper Danube River using stable isotope analyses (d 13 C and d 15 N), gut content analyses and morphometric analyses of the digestive tract. Both species were identified as predacious omnivores with high dietary overlap and a generalistic feeding strat-egy. Amphipods (especially invasive Dikerogamma-rus spp.) contributed 2/3 to the index of food importance. d 15 N-signatures of N. melanostomus revealed an ontogenetic diet shift and significantly exceeded those in P. kessleri by *1.5%, indicating a niche separation of half a trophic level. P. kessleri had shorter uncoiled intestinal tracts than N. melanosto-mus, indicating a narrower niche and adaptation to animal food. Trophic niches in both species expanded during the growth period with increasing intraguild predation and cannibalism in P. kessleri and increas-ing molluscivory in N. melanostomus. P. kessleri showed a higher degree of specialization and more stable feeding patterns across seasons, whereas N. melanostomus adapted its diet according to the natural prey availability. The feeding patterns of both species observed in the upper Danube River strongly differ from those in their native ranges, underlining their great plasticity. Both goby species consumed mainly other non-native species (*92% of gut contents) and seemed to benefit from previous inva-sions of prey species like Dikerogammarus villosus. The invasive success of gobies and their prey mirror fundamental ecological changes in large European freshwater ecosystems.
