Descriptions of the Adult Genitalia and Immatures of the Asian PlanthopperRicania speculum(Hemiptera: Fulgoroidea: Ricaniidae) Recently Introduced to Italy
The ricaniid planthopper Ricania speculum (Walker) (Hemiptera: Fulgoroidea) was recently introduced to Italy, apparently from southeast Asia. This species has the potential to become a significant agricultural pest, as it feeds on>60 species of plants, some of which are of economic importance. Here we describe and illustrate the adult male and female genitalia and the first-through fifth-instar nymphs. (c) 2016 The Authors.
