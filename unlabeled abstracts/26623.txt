Invasion of a Top Predator into an Epipelagic Ecosystem can bring a Paradoxical Top-Down Trophic Control
We apply mathematical modeling to explore different scenarios of invasion of a top predator (carnivorous zooplankton or planktivorous fish) into an epipelagic plankton ecosystem. We use a 'minimal' model of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations (nutrient-phytoplankton-herbivores) with the top predator density as a time-dependent parameter. The ecosystem shows different types of response, which can be described in terms of top-down trophic control. Our investigation indicates that under certain conditions the plankton ecosystem model demonstrates a surprising kind of response: in a wide range of realistic ecosystem parameters the invasion of the top predator leads to a prominent increase in the average density of zooplankton and to a resulting decrease of phytoplankton density. This phenomenon is opposite to the 'typical' top-down control when the carnivore pressure decreases zooplankton density which, in turn, increases phytoplankton biomass. We call the revealed type of top-down control 'paradoxical'. Examples of such a response in natural aquatic ecosystems were reported earlier but no clear explanation has been provided hitherto. In this paper, we analyze possible mechanisms of 'paradoxical top-down control' and show that it can occur in eutrophic epipelagic ecosystems subject to high rate of cross-pycnocline exchange.
