Occurrence of the bryozoan Amathia alternata Lamouroux, 1816 in the SW Atlantic: a new invasive species with potential impact on human livelihoods
Since 2018 specimens of the ctenostomatous bryozoan Amathia alternata Lamouroux, 1816 have been recorded in the SW Atlantic, between 23.0deg and 25.6deg S. Previously known only in the Northern Hemisphere, in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast of the USA, from North Carolina to Florida, these records indicate new invasion events on the Brazilian coast, where the species was first found in March 2018, stranded on sandy beaches along the northern coast of Sao Paulo state. Recent finds of mass strandings between June and August 2021, including new reports from sandy beaches in different localities of Rio de Janeiro, southern coast of Sao Paulo, and Parana, Brazil, suggest that the species has established itself successfully in the region and is spreading north- and southwards along the Brazilian coast, as previously reported for other introduced bryozoan species in the SW Atlantic. Accounts by local fishermen that the colonies are affecting catches indicate that the species might impact human livelihoods.
