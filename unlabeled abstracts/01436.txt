Development of microsatellite markers for the invasive weed Parthenium hysterophorus (Asteraceae).
Premise of the study: Microsatellite primers were developed for Parthenium hysterophorus to investigate its genetic structure and genetic diversity. Methods and results: Using the combined biotin capture method, 15 microsatellite primer sets were isolated and characterized. All markers showed polymorphism, and the number of alleles per locus ranged from two to nine across 60 individuals from two populations. The observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.117 to 0.750 and from 0.182 to 0.835, respectively. Conclusions: These markers will be useful for investigating the invasion history of this weed globally and to help characterize its invasiveness.
