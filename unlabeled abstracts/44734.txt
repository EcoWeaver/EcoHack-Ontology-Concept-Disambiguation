Foraging Strategies of Invasive Macaca fascicularis may Promote Plant Invasion in Mauritius
The effectiveness of seed dispersal by frugivorous primates may vary between seasons and plant species, depending on foraging strategies. We investigated how foraging strategies of an invasive frugivorous primate (the long-tailed macaque, Macaca fascicularis) affect seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) between native and invasive plants in Mauritius' native remnant forests. By collecting behavioural data on a group of partially habituated macaques via scan sampling from December 2019 until December 2020 (mean 19.2 +- SD 7.3 hours per month), we investigated seasonal patterns in diet, home range, and fruit availability to identify foraging strategies and determine fruit preference. We simultaneously assessed SDE for invasive vs native plants by quantifying native and invasive fruits consumed or dropped intact by macaques during feeding bouts (n = 114). Macaques fed increasingly on ripe invasive fruits and less on other food items as fruit availability increased, due to preference for invasive fruits and disproportionate availability of invasive vs native fruits. When fruit became scarcer, macaques had larger home ranges, increasingly fed on scarce unripe native and invasive fruits, and expanded their diet by eating orchard crops, indicating use of energy-maximizing strategies. Macaques consumed more native than invasive fruits when unripe and commonly destroyed seeds of native fruits, indicating higher SDE for invasive vs native plants. Higher discard rates of unripe compared to ripe fruits further reinforced these differences in SDE. Our results highlight potential facilitation of plant invasion by an invasive primate, due to foraging strategies shaped by the availability of invasive fruits.
