Carbon stocks in bamboo ecosystems worldwide: Estimates and uncertainties
From a review of 184 studies on bamboo biomass for 70 species (22 genera) we estimate plausible ranges for above-ground carbon (AGC) biomass (16-128 Mg C/ha), below-ground carbon (BGC) biomass (8-64 Mg C/ha), soil organic carbon (SOC; 70-200 Mg C/ha), and total ecosystem carbon (TEC; 94-392 Mg C/ha). The total ecosystem carbon range is below that for most types of forests, on par with that of rubber plantations and tree orchards, but greater than agroforests, oil palm, various types of swidden fallows, grasslands, shrublands, and pastures. High carbon biomass was associated with many Phyllostachys spp., including Moso (P. edulis) in China, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea, as well as other "giant" bamboo species of genera Bambusa, Dendrocalamus, Gigantochloa, and Guadua. The low end of the TEC range for mature bamboo typically included various species of dwarf bamboo, understory species, and stands stressed by climatic factors (temperature, rainfall), soil conditions, and management practices. Limited research and uncertainties associated with determinations prevent a robust assessment of carbon stocks for most species. Moso bamboo was by far the most studied species (>40% of the reported values), as it is commonly grown in plantations for commercial use. Similarly, a review of available allometric equations revealed that more work is needed to develop equations for predicting carbon biomass for most species. Most allometry equations exist for AGC for China, where 33 species have been studied. Allometric equations for BGC are rare, with all work conducted in China (15 species) and India (2). Root:shoot ratio estimate for most groups of species and genera were less than one, with the exception of Phyllostachys spp (however, some individual species with small sample size were greater than one).
