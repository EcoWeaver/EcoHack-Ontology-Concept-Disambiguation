Molluscicidal activity of vulgarone B fromArtemisia douglasiana(Besser) against the invasive, alien, mollusc pest,Pomacea canaliculata(Lamarck)
Golden apple snail (GAS), Pomacea canaliculata (Lamarck) is a pest in rice fields in Southeast Asia. Vulgarone B, a sesquiterpene from Artemisia douglasiana Besser, has been shown to have molluscicidal activity against ram's horn snail ( Planorbella trivolvis ), and, in this study, it was tested against GAS. Laboratory bioassays indicated that vulgarone B had activity comparable to that of the commercial synthetic molluscicide metaldehyde, both with an LC 50 at 24 h of about 30 mM. Sprayed vulgarone B is not toxic to rice seedlings at concentrations that caused 100% mortality of GAS. Vulgarone B, however, caused chlorosis when incorporated into agar on which rice seedlings were grown. At concentrations from 1 to 400 mM, there was no ovicidal activity on egg masses of various ages (1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 days). These data indicate that vulgarone B could be an effective molluscicide against GAS.
