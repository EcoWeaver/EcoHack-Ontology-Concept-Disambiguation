Genetic Characterization of Exotic Commercial Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Populations in Thailand Reveals High Genetic Diversity and Low Population Substructure
AbstractDomestication of animal species is often associated with a reduction in genetic diversity. The honey bee, Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758, has been managed by beekeepers for millennia for both honey and wax production and for crop pollination. Here we use both microsatellite markers and sequence data from the mitochondrial COI gene to evaluate genetic variation of managed A. mellifera in Thailand, where the species is introduced. Microsatellite analysis revealed high average genetic diversity with expected heterozygosities ranging from 0.620 +- 0.184 to 0.734 +- 0.071 per locus per province. Observed heterozygosities were generally lower than those expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, both locally and across the population as a whole. Mitochondrial sequencing revealed that the frequency of two evolutionary linages (C--Eastern European and O--Middle Eastern) are similar to those observed in a previous survey 10 yr ago. Our results suggest that Thai beekeepers are managing their A. mellifera in ways that retain overall genetic diversity, but reduce genetic diversity between apiaries.
