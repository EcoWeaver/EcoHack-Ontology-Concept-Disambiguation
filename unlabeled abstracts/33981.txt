Predatory versatility and intraspecific interactions ofCyrba algerinaandCyrba ocellata, web-invading spartaeine jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae)
This is the first behavioural study of Cyrba ocellata and an extension of an earlier study of Cyrba algerina. Cyrba is a spartaeine genus, Spartaeinae being a primitive salticid subfamily. Cyrba's behaviour is compared to that of other spartaeines and discussed in relation to salticid evolution. Cyrba builds a web-like resting structure which is more or less intermediate between the spacious prey-catching webs of some spartaeines and the compact enclosing nests typical of advanced salticids. In common with some other spartaeines, Cyrba is an araneophagic web-invading aggressive mimic that also practises kleptoparasitism and oophagy in invaded webs, and cursorial insectivory away from webs. C. algerina and C. ocellata have similar behaviour during intraspecific interactions. Also, these species' displays have basic similarities to displays of other salticids except that quiver swim waving is a distinctive display unique to Cyrba.
