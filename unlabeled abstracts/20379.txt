Woody biomass in the U.S. Cornbelt? Constraints and opportunities in the supply
The U.S. is clearly entering a new era of liquid fuel production; one that will be characterized by increasing degrees of renewable raw materials. Woody biomass is an especially compelling feedstock choice where available. Significant questions, however, exist regarding the potential of some landscapes to provide this feedstock. In an effort to answer these questions, we performed an exploratory spatial assessment of woody biomass production and supply capabilities in two-ecoregions Mississippi River corridor within the US Cornbelt. We used existing forest/timber inventories and conducted in-depth interviews with large regional sawmills to understand the accessibility of woody biomass from natural forests, availability of and general costs associated with woody biomass in the existing timber industry, and potential for production from short-rotation woody crop plantations. On an annual basis, taking into account only the annual net growth of non-sawlog species the Midwest Driftless Area currently produces 3.14 times the raw material required by a hypothetical facility using one-half million dry tons of woody biomass per year. Although allocated over a larger area, the Central Dissected Till Plain produces 3.94 times the required material. Throughout the entire region there would be an additional lower bound estimate of 107,000 dry Mg from easily transportable sawmill residues. The ecological state of US Cornbelt forests stand to gain from a developed market for woody biomass as proper woodland management to harvest trees, preserve wildlife, and reduce risk from disease, pests, and invasive species typically involves harvesting the low-value trees that will by and large drive the woody biomass system.
