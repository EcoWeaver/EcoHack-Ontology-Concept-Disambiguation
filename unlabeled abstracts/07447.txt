The invaders: phylogeography of dengue and chikungunya viruses Aedes vectors, on the South West islands of the Indian Ocean
Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti are the two main worldwide arbovirus vectors that have experienced invasion phases. Aedes aegypti is a pantropical species that spread centuries ago whereas Ae. albopictus started the main wave of invasion in the 1980s. Both species have been at various times on the different islands in Southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO). This area provides an opportunity to examine the extent to which mosquitoes colonization patterns are influenced by different introductory events likely linked with human settlement and migration between the islands. To explore this hypothesis, we propose a CO1-based phylogeny using a large sampling of fresh Ae. albopictus, Ae. aegypti, and Ae. mascarensis, and 50-year-old dry specimens originating from different Indian Ocean islands.
