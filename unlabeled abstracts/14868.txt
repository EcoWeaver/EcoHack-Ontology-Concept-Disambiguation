Detection of invasive freshwater fish species using environmental DNA survey
Invasive species are one of the most significant problem in freshwater ecosystems. Most common non-native freshwater species in Turkish freshwater fish fauna are Prussian Carp (Carassius gibelio), North African Catfish (Clarias gariepinus), Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and Topmouth Gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva). Recent studies showed that environmental DNA could be used to detect target species inhabiting the ecosystem with higher precision and less effort compared to traditional field surveys. In this study, eDNA approach was used to investigate non-native freshwater fish species from fifteen different locations of Upper Sakarya Basin. eDNA was successfully extracted from the water samples of locations where the species were visually observed. Mean amplification rate of eDNA was calculated as 77.03%. This study is the first environmental DNA study used in detection of four of the most common invasive freshwater fish species. Results clearly indicating that eDNA surveys could be used as an important molecular tool to monitor invasive fish species in freshwater ecosystems.
