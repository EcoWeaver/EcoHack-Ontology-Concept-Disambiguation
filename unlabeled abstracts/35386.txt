Morphological Comparisons of Taiwan Native Wild Tea Plant (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze forma formosensis Kitamura) and Two Closely Related Taxa Using Numerical Methods
Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze forma formosensis Kitamura is generally referred to as the tea plant growing naturally in mid-elevation mountains of Taiwan. Several taxonomic treatments have been published for this plant in the past, but some contradictory results have been obtained. To assess the taxonomic position of the wild tea plant and explore its relationship with two other closely related taxa, C. sinensis var. sinensis and C. sinensis var. assamica, 16 vegetative and 11 floral characters were examined on 165 OTUs. The data were analyzed using cluster analysis and nonlinear principal components analysis. All cluster phenograms consistently separated the native wild tea plant from two other related taxa. Conversely, pronounced admixture between C. sinensis var. sinensis and C. sinensis var. assamica was present. The nonlinear principal components analysis indicated that the surface features of buds and ovaries are two diagnostic characters. Based on the present study, it is proposed that the Taiwan native wild tea plant might deserve recognition as a distinct species.
