How citizen scientists contribute to monitor protected areas thanks to automatic plant identification tools
1. Successful monitoring and management of plant resources worldwide needs the involvement of civil society to support natural reserve managers. Because it is difficult to correctly and quickly identify plant species for non-specialists, the development of recent techniques based on automatic visual identification should facilitate and increase public engagement in citizen science initiatives. 2. Automatic identification platforms are new to most citizen scientists and land managers. Pl@ntNet is such a platform, available since 2013 on web and mobile environments, and now included in several workflows such as invasive alien species management, endemic species monitoring, educational activities, and eco-tourism practices. The successful development of such platforms needs to identify their strengths and weaknesses in order to improve and facilitate their use in all aspects of ecosystem management. 3. Here we present two cases of conservation practitioners using Pl@ntNet in Europe (France) and Africa (Kenya). We expose the benefits and discuss the limitations and perspectives. Based on the experiences of field managers, we formulate several recommendations for future initiatives. These recommendations should more broadly interest diverse actors within the citizen sciences, who usually face the need to bridge the gap between managers and citizens.
