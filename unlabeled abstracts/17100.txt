Generalized "avatar" niche shifts improve distribution models for invasive species
Species distribution models are an invaluable tool for anticipating the potential range of invasive species. These models often improve when both native and non-native occurrences are available for model development and validation. Therefore, how might ecologists anticipate the potential distributions for emerging invasive species that lack any or abundant non-native range occurrences? Here, we evaluate the recent suggestion of transferring niche shifts from well-established 'avatar' invaders to emerging invaders by testing if ensemble niche shifts from a group of globally invasive plants improve model predictions when each of these species is iteratively treated as an 'emerging' invader.
