Impacts of an alien species (Spartina alterniflora) on the macrobenthos community of Jiangsu coastal inter-tidal ecosystem
Spartina alterniflora, a species vegetating on inter-tidal flats that was introduced from the eastern coast of United States, has become a hot topic, focusing on its invasion within local species in the coastal zone of China. Impacts of S. alterniflora on the inter-tidal macrobenthos community in the Jiangsu coastland are addressed by comparing the macrobenthos characteristics in a mudflat and in a four-year-old Spartina salt marsh that had earlier been a mudflat. During the period October 2002-July 2003, we studied the distribution pattern and diversity of macrobenthos, and discussed their correlation with environmental factors caused by Spartina vegetation. The results showed that a total of 43 macrobenthos species were found, mainly consisting of Mollusca, Crustacea, and Annelida. Ten macrobenthos species were found in the Spartina salt marsh, and 36 species were found in the mudflat. Life forms and functional groups of macrobenthos in the Spartina salt marsh were obviously distrinct from that of the mudflat. The study showed that macrobenthos diversity in the Spartina salt marsh decreased, and the community structure altered obviously, whereas the biomass showed no differences in different seasons. Statistical analysis demonstrated that seasonal change of macrobenthos diversity in the Spartina salt marsh negatively related to content of sediment organic matter, total N, bulk density, height and biomass of Spartina vegetation, and positively related to the density of Spartina. All these differences suggested the obvious effects of the Spartina vegetation on the Jiangsu inter-tidal benthic macroinvertebrate ecology. Furthermore, the investigation also showed that the niche of the native macrobenthos living in the mudflat has been transferred down, seaward, due to the invasion of Spartina in our study site.
