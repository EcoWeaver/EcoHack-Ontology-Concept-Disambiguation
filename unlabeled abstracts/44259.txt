A review of adaptive evolution of defense strategies in an invasive plant species, Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera)
Selection on defense strategies of plant species may be different in direction and magnitude among sites, because of differences in the herbivore communities in which plant populations are embedded. This may be the case for some invasive species, which are often introduced without coevolved specialists, but suffer generalist damage comparable to their native ones. We review recent advances in the adaptive evolution of defense strategies in Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) and other invasive plant species. We focus particularly on resistance and tolerance , direct and indirect resistance, and constitutive and induced resistance to understanding the effects of herbi-vores on invasive plant success. Furthermore, we evaluate the effects of changes in defense strategies on the efficiency of biological control. We also propose future research on defense strategies of invasive plant species.
