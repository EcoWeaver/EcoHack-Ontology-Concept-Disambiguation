Restoring and Protecting the world's large marine ecosystems: An engine for job creation and sustainable economic development
Some of the most significant threats to the sustainability of the world's 66 Large Marine Ecosystems (LME) - invasive species, coastal hypoxia, overfishing, marine debris and ocean acidification - are due to a combination of market and/or policy failures which cause these environmental externalities. A concerted global effort to remove these barriers would not only lead to dramatic improvements in ocean health and preservation of trillions of dollars in ocean-related goods and services and hundreds of millions of existing jobs, but also catalyze transformation across a range of ocean using and affecting sectors that would create millions of new, and in many cases, well paying, jobs for people across both the developed and developing world.
