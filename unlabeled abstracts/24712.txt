The potential of the human-animal relationship as an environmental enrichment for the welfare of zoo-housed animals
Environmental enrichment strategies are used to improve both the physiological and psychological welfare of captive animals, which can be achieved by increasing the expression of natural behaviour and decreasing abnormal behaviours. Examples of successful environmental enrichment include the improvement of enclosure design, and the provision of feeding devices, novel objects, appropriate social groupings and other sensory stimuli. However, a key factor contributing to how a captive animal interacts with its environment is its relationship with humans. Firstly, this paper focuses upon the extent to which an animal's fear of humans may affect its overall behaviour, and the consequences of the subsequent human-animal relationship (HAR).
