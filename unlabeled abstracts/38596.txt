Allelopathic potential of Phragmites australis extracts on the growth of invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides
We tested the allelopathic potential of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin ethanol-extracts from different parts on the growth of Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb. We determined the bud numbers of tested ramets, root-top ratio, chlorophyll content, node number, height, leaf area, succulent degree and electric conductivity of new stem of invasive plants. The ethanol extracts from the stem of P. australis inhibited the growth of A. philoxeroides. The ethanol extracts decreased the bud number of ramets, root-top ratio and chlorophyll content, but increased the node number, plant height, leaf area, succulence degree and relative electric conductivity of A. philoxeroides. However, the concentration of the ethanol extract had little effects on the indexes of A. philoxeroides. This research indicated that P. australis might be used as an ecological method to control the A. philoxeroides due to its inhibitory effects. However, more research is needed.
