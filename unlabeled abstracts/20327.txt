Aphids and associated natural enemies on Ile Amsterdam and Ile Saint-Paul, Southern Indian Ocean
AbstractIle Amsterdam (37deg50'S, 77deg30'E, 55 km2) and Ile Saint-Paul (38deg43'S, 77deg31'E, 7 km2) are very isolated volcanic islands which were originally colonized by a few invertebrate fauna and flora. Invasive species richness has then increased along with human activity. A three-year monitoring programme (1997, 2000, 2001) and a summer campaign (2007) allowed species diversity, host plants, abundance and phenology of introduced aphids and natural enemies to be described. Seven cosmopolitan aphid species have been found on Ile Amsterdam (Aulacorthum solani,A. circumflexum,Macrosiphum euphorbiae,Myzus ascalonicus,M. cymbalariae,M. ornatusandRhopalosiphum padi) and three on Ile Saint-Paul (A. solani,M. cymbalariaeandR. padi). On Ile Amsterdam, these aphids were found on 28 host plants (out of 57 sampled plants), mainly introduced species.Phylica arboreawas the only native plant much colonized by one aphid species,A. circumflexum. Aphids were mainly present on the base or in this vicinity. One Hymenopteran parasitoid,Aphidius matricariae, and two hyperparasites (Dendrocerus aphidumandPhaenoglyphis villosa), probably introduced along with their host, were collected. Aphid activity is very low during the autumn (March-May) and at a maximum in spring and summer. Their density and diversity decrease with distance from the research station. From these results, the possible impact of aphids on native plants is discussed.
