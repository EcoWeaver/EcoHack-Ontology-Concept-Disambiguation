Modeling multispecies biofilms including new bacterial species invasion
A mathematical model for multispecies biofilm evolution based on continuum approach and mass conservation principles is presented. The model can describe biofilm growth dynamics including spatial distribution of microbial species, substrate concentrations, attachment, and detachment, and, in particular, is able to predict the biological process of colonization of new species and transport from bulk liquid to biofilm (or vice-versa). From a mathematical point of view, a significant feature is the boundary condition related to biofilm species concentrations on the biofilm free boundary. These data, either for new or for already existing species, are not required by this model, but rather can be predicted as results. Numerical solutions for representative examples are obtained by the method of characteristics. Results indicate that colonizing bacteria diffuse into biofilm and grow only where favorable environmental conditions exist for their development.
