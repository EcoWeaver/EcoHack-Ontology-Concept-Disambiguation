Effects of a microsporidium from the convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), on three non-target coccinellids.
A microsporidium from Hippodamia convergens was transmitted horizontally to three non-target coccinellid hosts (Adalia bipunctata L., Coccinella septempunctata L. and Harmonia axyridis Pallas) under laboratory conditions. For all species examined, microsporidia-infected larvae took significantly longer to develop than did uninfected larvae but the microsporidium had no effect on larval mortality. Adult sex ratios of uninfected and microsporidia-infected adults were about 1:1 (female symbol:male symbol) and did not differ significantly. At the end of a 90-day trial, microsporidia-infected H. convergens produced significantly fewer eggs and did not live as long as uninfected individuals. Differences in fecundity and longevity were not observed for the three non-target coccinellids that were examined. Mean spore counts from smear preparations of microsporidia-infected A. bipunctata did not differ significantly from H. convergens, suggesting that A. bipunctata (a native coccinellid) is a suitable host for the microsporidium but infection was lighter in C. septempunctata and H. axyridis (introduced species). Vertical transmission of the pathogen was observed during the 90-day trial by examining eggs and larvae that were produced by microsporidia-infected adults. For all species examined, 100% vertical transmission of the pathogen was eventually observed. Three eugregarines were found in two adult A. bipunctata: Gregarine A trophozoites are similar in size to those of Gregarina katherina Watson (described earlier from Coccinella spp.), Gregarine B trophozoites are similar in size to those of Gregarine A but are morphology distinct, and Gregarine C trophozoites are similar in size to G. barbarara Watson (described earlier from A. bipunctata).
