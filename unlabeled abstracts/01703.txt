Comparative characterization of Na+ transport in Cyprinodon variegatus variegatus and Cyprinodon variegatus hubbsi: a model species complex for studying teleost invasion of freshwater
SUMMARY The euryhaline fish Cyprinodon variegatus variegatus is capable of tolerating ambient salinities ranging from 0.3 to 160 PSU, but is incapable of long-term survival in freshwater (&lt;2 mmol l-1 Na+). A population isolated in several freshwater (0.4-1 mmol l-1 Na+) lakes in central Florida is now designated as a subspecies (Cyprinodon variegatus hubbsi). We conducted a comparative study of Na+ transport kinetics in these two populations when acclimated to different ambient Na+ concentrations. Results reveal that the two subspecies have qualitatively similar low affinity Na+ uptake kinetics (Km=7000-38,000 mmol l-1) when acclimated to 2 or 7 mmol l-1 Na+, but C. v. hubbsi switches to a high affinity system (Km=100-140 mmol l-1) in low-Na+ freshwater (<=1 mmol l-1 Na+). Inhibitor experiments indicate that Na+ uptake in both subspecies is EIPA-sensitive, but sensitivity decreases with increasing external Na+. EIPA induced a 95% inhibition of Na+ influx in C. v. hubbsi acclimated to 0.1 mmol l-1 Na+, suggesting that this subspecies is utilizing a Na+/H+ exchanger to take up Na+ in low-Na+ environments despite theoretical thermodynamic constraints. Na+ uptake in C. v. hubbsi acclimated to 0.1 mmol l-1 Na+ is phenamil-sensitive but not bafilomycin-sensitive, leading to uncertainty about whether this subspecies also utilizes Na+ channels for Na+ uptake. Experiments with both subspecies acclimated to 7 mmol l-1 Na+ also indicate that a Cl--dependent Na+ uptake pathway is present. This pathway is not metolazone-sensitive (NCC inhibitor) in either species but is bumetanide-sensitive in C. v. variegatus but not C. v. hubbsi. This suggests that an apical NKCC is increasingly involved with Na+ uptake for this subspecies as external Na+ increases. Finally, characterization of mitochondria-rich cell (MRC) size and density in fish acclimated to different ambient Na+ concentrations revealed significant increases in the number and size of emergent MRCs with decreasing ambient Na+. A linear relationship between the fractional area of emergent MRCs and Na+ uptake rate was observed for both subspecies. However, C. v. variegatus have lower Na+ uptake rates at a given MRC fractional area compared with C. v. hubbsi, indicating that the enhanced Na+ uptake by C. v. hubbsi at low ambient Na+ concentrations is not strictly a result of increased MRC fractional area, and other variables, such as differential expression of proteins involved in Na+ uptake, must provide C. v. hubbsi with the ability to osmoregulate in dilute freshwater.
