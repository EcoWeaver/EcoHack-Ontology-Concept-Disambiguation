Mapping the occurrence of Chromolaena odorata (L.) in subtropical forest gaps using environmental and remote sensing data
Globally, subtropical forests are rich in biodiversity. However, the native biodiversity in these forests is threatened by the presence of invasive species such as Chromolaena odorata (L.) King and Robinson, which thrives in forest canopy gaps. Our study explored the utility of WorldView-2 data, an 8-band high resolution (2 m) imagery for mapping the probability of C. odorata occurrence (presence/absence) in canopy gaps of a subtropical forest patch, the Dukuduku forest, South Africa. An integrated modelling approach involving the WorldView-2 vegetation indices and ancillary environmental data was also assessed. The results showed a higher performance of the environmental data only model (deviance or D 2 = 0.52, p
