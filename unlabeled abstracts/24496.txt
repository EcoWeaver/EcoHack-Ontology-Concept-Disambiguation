Space use of a non-native species, the European hare (Lepus europaeus), in habitats of the southern vizcacha (Lagidium viscacia) in Northwestern Patagonia, Argentina
Two medium-sized herbivores with high trophic overlap coexist on rocky outcrops in the Patagonian landscape: the southern vizcacha (Lagidium viscacia), which is a native rock specialist, and the European hare (Lepus europaeus), which is a non-native species. We determined the patterns of space use related to distance from outcrops and analyzed spatial overlap between the two species. There were significant differences between the two species in the use of space adjacent to outcrops. The southern vizcacha mainly uses short and medium distances from the outcrop (up to 40m), whereas the hare's greatest activity was recorded at distances greater than 50m. However, there is a partial overlap at medium distances (30-40m) among both herbivores. Although, in general terms, there is no significant spatial overlap between hares and southern vizcachas, their biological characteristics and the high dietary overlap between the species allow us to predict that, if resources become scarce, the hare could extend its area of activity, as what happens elsewhere, and exploit food resources near outcrops, increasing the vulnerability of vizcacha colonies.
