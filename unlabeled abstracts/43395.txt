Infestation of the invasive mollusc Crepidula fornicata by the native shell borer Cliona celata: a case of high parasite load without detrimental effects
The temporal prevalence of the widespread boring sponge Cliona celata and its effects were analysed in a population of the invasive mollusc Crepidula fornicata. This mollusc produces extra shell material when infested with the endolithic sponge, suggesting that infestation may be detrimental for C. fornicata growth and/or reproduction. For 37months, size, sex, female reproductive status and sponge-infestation stage were recorded for 300 individuals sampled every month in the Bay of Morlaix (France). In the 12,049 individuals examined, the prevalence of C. celata was high with a monthly average of 43.1% of the individuals hosting the sponge. The relative proportion of heavily infested individuals generally increased over time. Nevertheless, a cyclic decrease occurred every 10months, suggesting putative episodes of mortality of heavily infested individuals. The gregarious behaviour of the mollusc seemed to promote the high prevalence of the sponge, which may propagate through contact between neighbouring C. fornicata individuals. Due to the sex-size relationship in protandrous C. fornicata, females were far more infested than males. We did not find evidence for a cost of producing extra shell material on somatic growth or on female fertility, and the boring sponge is unlikely to substantially affect the sex-change patterns in C. fornicata. The limited effects of the endolithic sponge on C. fornicata contrasts with the documented damage to some local species, including commercially exploited shellfish, suggesting that C. fornicata may alter the infestation dynamics in the surrounding native community. Dedicated studies are now needed to investigate the extent and mechanisms of these species interactions. KeywordsBoring sponge-Invasive mollusc-Sex change-Species interaction
