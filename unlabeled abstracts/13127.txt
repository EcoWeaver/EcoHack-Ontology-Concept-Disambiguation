Artificial hard substrate as a habitat for hard bottom benthic assemblages in the southern part of the Baltic Sea - a preliminary study
Benthic species associated with hard substrate are known to form communities characterized by high abundance and biomass. Although the bottom of the Southern Baltic Sea is dominated by soft sediments, such communities find favorable conditions to thrive on artificial substrates of offshore constructions. The aim of this research was to characterize both short-term and long-term benthic communities associated with artificial hard bottom provided by man-made structures in the Southern Baltic Sea. Species composition as well as the abundance and biomass were examined at various sites. An inactive World War II torpedo testing facility in the Gulf of Gdansk served as a site for sampling long-term communities while short-term communities were sampled using settlement panels and PVC cylinders. Panels were deployed at the torpedo testing facility for 127 days. PVC cylinders were deployed for 141-190 days in the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone. Twenty six macrofaunal taxa, including 12 crustaceans, were identified during the research.
