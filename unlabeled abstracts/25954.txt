Learning from our mistakes: minimizing problems with invasive biofuel plants
One of the environmental concerns associated with producing biofuels from alien plants is the risk of these species becoming invasive. We explored whether insights from commercial forestry and agroforestry could inform strategies to reduce future problems with invasive biofuel plants.The dynamics, dimensions, and extent of invasions of forestry species can be explained using models incorporating species traits, environmental features, stochastic factors associated with plantings, and residence time. Economic driving forces are crucial.Important lessons to be learnt from forestry for reducing problems with invasiveness of alien species for biofuel production include: the use of global databases and screening tools for identifying high-risk species; the design and configuration of plantations to minimize spread risk; and the use of biological control to reduce invasiveness.Research highlights> Problems with invasiveness set to grow as planting of alien plant species for biofuel production increases. > Lessons from invasions in commercial forestry and agroforestry suggest approaches to minimize problems. > Species selection, reduction of seed production, configuration and design of plantings are crucial. > Certification and international best-practice standards must be developed and integrated with national and regional policies.
