Exploiting seasonal habitat use of the common carp, Cyprinus carpio, in a lacustrine system for management and eradication
The control of invasive species is a major challenge to the preservation of native ecosystems, both terrestrial and aquatic. A population of the invasive common carp, Cyprinus carpio, was detected in Lakes Sorell and Crescent, Tasmania, Australia, in the mid-1990s. Early detection allowed for the containment of their population to this lacustrine system. Radio-telemetry was subsequently used over a 5-year period to understand seasonal distribution of carp in relation to environmental parameters to guide efficient eradication strategies. The present study found that fish displayed increased mobility during spring-summer periods, moving into shallow habitat rich in macrophytes, particularly during years of high lake levels. During years of low lake levels, this pattern was altered with frequent use of a rocky 'secondary' habitat in Lake Sorell. During winter, carp congregated in deeper habitat in Lake Sorell, whereas no habitat-specific winter aggregations were found in Lake Crescent. The increased knowledge of spatio-temporal preferences of carp provided a basis for deploying barriers to facilitate the capture of fish and sabotage spawning events. The results have led to the eradication of carp from Lake Crescent and a significant reduction of their population in Lake Sorell.
