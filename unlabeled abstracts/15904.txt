Foreclosures and Invasive Insect Spread: The Case of Asian Citrus Psyllid
Human economic activity is considered to be an important factor in exacerbating the speed of invasive species spread, but may also play an important role in preventing it. In this study, we investigate the role of home foreclosure in the spread of Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama) throughout residential areas of Southern California. We find that foreclosures are indeed a significant factor in explaining ACP spread, even after controlling for other human and environmental effects. Our results suggest that human economic activity may be more important in controlling the spread of invasive species than previously realized, and that the external costs of the foreclosure problem may also be underestimated.
