ALTERNATIVE METHODS TO ANALYZE THE RANK ORDERED DATA: A CASE OF INVASIVE SPECIES CONTROL
Data collected regarding homeowner preferences for various Formosan Subterranean termite control methods were analyzed using ordered probit and exploded logit models. Ordered probit model for first, second and fourth preferences had similar variables significant, although the first preference model had many significant variables. The most important variable, in terms of significance, across all preferences was the perception that a respondent thinks that termite existence is a problem in their neighborhood. The results from the exploded logit model indicated that a control option with liquid treatment option and more visits by a pest control agency is a less preferred treatment option.
