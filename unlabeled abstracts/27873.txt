Nurse effect of the native cushion plant Azorella monantha on the invasive non-native Taraxacum officinale in the high-Andes of central Chile
Positive interactions among native plant species are common in alpine habitats, particularly those where one species (nurse plant) generates microclimatic conditions that are more benign than the surrounding environment, facilitating the establishment of other species. Nonetheless, these microclimatic conditions could facilitate the establishment of non-native species as well. A conspicuous component of the alien alpine flora of the central Chilean Andes is the perennial herb Taraxacum officinale agg. (dandelion). In contrast to other alien species that are restricted to human-disturbed sites, T. officinale is frequently observed growing within native plant communities dominated by cushion plants. In this study we evaluated if T. officinale is positively associated with the cushion plant Azorella monantha. Via seedling survival experiments and gas-exchange measurements we also assessed the patterns of facilitation between cushions and dandelions, and explore the potential mechanisms of invasion by dandelions. T. officinale grows spatially positively associated with cushions of A. monantha. Survival of seedlings, as well as their net-photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance, were higher within cushions than in open areas away from them, suggesting that the microclimatic modifications generated by this native cushion facilitates the establishment and performance of a non-native invasive species. Our results, as well as other recent studies, highlight the role of native communities in facilitating rather than constraining non-native plant invasions, particularly in stressful habitats such as alpine environments.
