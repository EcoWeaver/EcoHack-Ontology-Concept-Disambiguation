Range extension of the invasive freshwater fish species, gibel carp Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782) in western Turkey
Gibel carp Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782) has become an important non-native fish in all regions of Turkish inland waters with its wide distribution, high prevalence and impacts on native fish species through mainly reproductive and feeding interactions. This paper presents the first record of gibel carp caught on 15 December 2011 from Tersakan Stream in Mugla Province in SW Turkey. Size range of the species, possible introduction pathways and structure of the stream suggest that the species could well fit in its new environments and that further spread is likely.
