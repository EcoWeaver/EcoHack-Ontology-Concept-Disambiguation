Environmental history of the St. Marys River
This paper provides a brief history of the navigational and industrial activities that led to the St. Marys River being declared a Great Lakes Area of Concern in 1985 and serves to give context to the special issue of the Journal of Great Lakes Research devoted to the St. Marys River. Although much of the river contains important fish and wildlife habitat including mostly intact coastal wetlands, the urban areas of the upper St. Marys River have been impacted over the past 100+years by industrial and navigational development. One of the more severe impacts was the near-total destruction of the once-prolific St. Marys Rapids. Large volumes of pollution were discharged into the river including up to 10,000kg/day of oil and grease. The invasion of sea lamprey severely reduced lake trout and other fisheries. Water quality monitoring and other studies from the 1970s to 1980s documented these problems. Enforcement of environmental regulations enacted in Canada and the United States, investments in pollution control technology by industry and the municipalities, and improved fisheries management for invasive species have resulted in improved environmental conditions, however legacy impacts remain. The on-going Remedial Action Plan (RAP) process provides a framework for continued environmental improvements.
