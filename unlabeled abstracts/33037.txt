The Balance of Terror: An Alternative Mechanism for Competitive Trade-Offs and Its Implications for Invading Species
This article uses models to propose an explanation for three observations in community ecology: the apparent overreaction of prey to attack by specialist predators, the existence of a common trade-off among components of competitive ability in communities of unrelated competitors, and the ability of invading species to break the native trade-off. Strategies that increase resource collection ability are assumed to increase vulnerability to attack by specialist consumers according to a vulnerability function. If competitors compete for a common resource and share the same form of the vulnerability function, then they are favored to converge on the same evolutionarily stable level of competitiveness or trade-off curve even if the parameters describing their specialized consumers differ. The position of the common strategy or trade-off curve depends on the whole guild, with more speciose guilds tending to favor higher levels of competitiveness. Invaders can break the native trade-off if they come from a guild with a higher trade-off curve, an effect possibly enhanced evolutionarily by escape from specialist consumers.
