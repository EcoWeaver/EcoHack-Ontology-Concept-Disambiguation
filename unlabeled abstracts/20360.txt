Landscape factors that shape a slow and persistent aquatic invasion: brown trout in Newfoundland 1883-2010
Aim We investigated watershed-scale abiotic environmental factors associated with population establishment of one of the 'world's 100 worst alien invaders' on a temperate Atlantic island. Within the context of the conservation implications, we aimed to quantify (1) the early history and demographics (numbers and origins) of human-mediated brown trout (Salmo trutta) introductions, (2) the current distribution of established populations, and (3) the watershed-scale environmental factors that may resist or facilitate trout establishment.
