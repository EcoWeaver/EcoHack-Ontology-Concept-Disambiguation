Mayaca fluviatilis Aubl.: an ornamental aquatic with invasive potential in Sri Lanka
The ornamental aquatic plant industry in Sri Lanka has grown substantially during the last decade and there is a renewed demand for several exotic species. Mayaca fluviatilis, a submerged plant used in aquaria, is not recorded as a naturally occurring plant in Sri Lanka. However, recent studies recorded it in the wet zone of Sri Lanka and certain countries have recognized it as a problematic plant. The knowledge of the mode of propagation of invasive species is vital in the management of biological invasions. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the propagation ability of vegetative parts of M. fluviatilis. A field survey was conducted in the wet zone of Sri Lanka, and populations of M. fluviatilis were monitored between 2006 and 2009. The propagation ability of different maturity stages of stem cuttings (terminal, middle and basal) were investigated, and terminal stem cuttings with five different lengths (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 cm) were used to investigate the propagation ability of fragmented vegetative parts. Terminal shoots showed the highest survival rates and significantly high (P
