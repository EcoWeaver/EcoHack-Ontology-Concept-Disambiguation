Real-time PCR identification of the ambrosia beetles, Trypodendron domesticum (L.) and Trypodendron lineatum (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae)
The European hardwood ambrosia beetle (Trypodendron domesticum) and the striped ambrosia beetle (Trypodendron lineatum) are wood-boring pests that can cause serious damage to lumber, resulting in a need for management of these pests in logging and lumber industries. Natural populations of ambrosia beetles exist throughout the world, but movement of ambrosia beetles into new habitats, particularly via international trade, can result in the establishment of invasive species that have the potential to spread into new territory. Efforts to monitor ambrosia beetle populations are time-consuming and could be greatly enhanced by the use of molecular methods, which would provide accurate and rapid identification of potentially problematic species. Here, we present new real-time PCR assays for the detection and identification of T. domesticum and T. lineatum. The methods described herein can be used with a variety of sampling strategies to enable timely and well-informed decision-making in efforts to control these ambrosia beetles.
