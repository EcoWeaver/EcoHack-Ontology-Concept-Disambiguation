Response of Acartia populations to environmental variability and effects of invasive congenerics in the estuary of Bilbao, Bay of Biscay
The effect of environmental factors (river discharge, water temperature and dissolved oxygen saturation) on the abundance and distribution of Acartia populations and the interactions between their congenerics was evaluated by means of transfer function (TF) models in the estuary of Bilbao during the period 1998-2005. The recorded species were Acartia clausi, Acartia tonsa, Acartia margalefi and Acartia discaudata. Acartia clausi dominated in the entire euhaline region of this estuary until 2003 when it was displaced from the inner part by A. tonsa. This invasive species (A. tonsa) was found for the first time in 2001 and colonized successfully the inner (salinity 30) and intermediate (salinity 33) waters of this estuary since 2003. The TF models revealed an immediate and negative effect of A. tonsa on A. clausi in the intermediate salinity (33) waters, where these species showed the highest spatial overlap. The results indicate that environmental changes from 2003 influenced the abundance of Acartia species, being unfavourable for A. clausi. The decrease of A. clausi abundance in low salinity waters was related to a significant decrease of dissolved oxygen saturation levels, whereas the increase of temperature was linked to a significant increase of A. tonsa. Acartia margalefi and A. discaudata were scarce over the entire period, but they were found to be valuable indicators of hydrological changes, which were associated to climate factors. These two latter species increased in abundance and expanded their seasonal distribution, and in the case of A. margalefi also its spatial distribution, in 2002, coinciding with the period in the time-series when autumn-winter rainfall and summer temperatures were lowest, and dissolved oxygen saturation levels were highest.
