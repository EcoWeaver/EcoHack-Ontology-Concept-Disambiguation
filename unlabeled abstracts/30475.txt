Competitive strength of Australian swamp stonecrop (Crassula helmsii) invading moorland pools
We conducted two indoor experiments to test the competitive strength of the invasive plant Crassula helmsii in comparison to that of two native moorland species from northwest Europe, Littorella uniflora and Hypericum elodes in terrestrial conditions. In both experiments nutrient-poor moorland soil was used. The total cover of C. helmsii increased gradually in monocultures, until after 7-20 weeks a maximum of 12% in experiment 1 and 15-20% in experiment 2 was reached in the control conditions. Nitrogen content of C. helmsii plants was very low at the end of the latter experiment. Adding additional N had little effect in experiment 1, but in experiment 2 C. helmsii cover doubled. In the mixed cultures, C. helmsii fared worse than the native species. In experiment 1 the increase in cover was higher for both L. uniflora and H. elodes than in their monocultures, while in experiment 2 fresh weight at the end of the experiment was 3 times higher for L. uniflora and did not differ significantly between H. elodes and C. helmsii. The results indicate that the native species are better competitors for nutrients than C. helmsii due to their larger root system. No allelopathic effect of L. uniflora on C. helmsii growth was observed. These observations are discussed in the light of C. helmsiimanagement in the field.
