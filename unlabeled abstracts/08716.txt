Effects of chemical management for invasive plants on the performance of Lithobates pipiens tadpoles.
Invasive plants impact amphibians by altering habitat, species interactions, and by releasing potentially toxic secondary chemicals. Despite being costly and having the potential for impacts to non-target wildlife, chemical management is commonly used to control invasive plants. Prior research has indicated that individual effects of invasive plants or herbicides can be harmful to aquatic organisms; however, information is lacking on the combined effect of these factors on amphibians. A laboratory experiment was performed to assess the impact of leachates of the invasive plants Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) and European buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), the herbicide Renovate(r) 3 (triclopyr), and combined effects of each plant leachate and the herbicide on the growth, morphology and survival of northern leopard frog (Lithobates pipiens) tadpoles. No effects of treatment on survival were observed. Tadpole exposure to M. spicatum reduced body mass by 17%, exposure to R. cathartica increased body mass by 36%, and exposure to R. cathartica + low herbicide increased body mass by 38% (although only early in the experiment). Exposure to Renovate(r) 3 induced a 16% and 29% decrease in tadpole size in lower (0.22 mg triclopyr ai /L) and higher (0.92 mg triclopyr ai /L) concentration treatments, respectively. Results from this study highlight the importance of considering both individual and combined effects of invasive plants and herbicides, since they may have different outcomes for tadpole growth and development.
