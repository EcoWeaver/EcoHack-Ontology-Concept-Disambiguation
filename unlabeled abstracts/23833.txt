Identification and Control of Invasive Privets (Ligustrumspp.) in the Middle Southern United States
AbstractThe identification of privet in the middle southern United States can be difficult. Because most introduced species of privet can be invasive, and recent mapping projects seek location and species population data, proper identification is important. Without proper identification of privet species, data on species distributions and other pertinent information regarding invasiveness could lead to improper conclusions. Currently, information on privet identification is scattered throughout a number of reference materials. The purpose of this publication is to assist with the proper identification of escaped privet species, and suggest management options.
