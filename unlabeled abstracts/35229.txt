Stakeholders' perceptions of the impacts of invasive exotic plant species in the Mediterranean region
Invasive species pose an increasing environmental problem across the globe, but to date socio-economic perspectives on this problem have been limited. In this study stakeholder perceptions of the impacts of invasive exotic plant species on the islands of Mallorca, Sardinia and Crete are examined through the use of semi-structured interviews, Likert scales and Contingent Valuation. Results showed substantial concerns about the impact of invasive exotic plant species on the islands, particularly on Mallorca where awareness of the issue has increased in recent times due to campaigns to eradicate terrestrial and aquatic invasive plants. Not all perceptions are negative and several respondents suggest that a turnover in local species is an inherent part of the sense of the place in the region. If the management of invasive exotic plant species in the Mediterranean region is to improve then there is a need to raise awareness of the impact of invasive species amongst both the general public and professional stakeholders.
