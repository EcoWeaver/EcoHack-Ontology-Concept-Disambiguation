Note: First report of the Q biotype ofBemisia tabaci in Southern Sonora, Mexico
Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) adults were collected from poinsettia plants (Euphorbia pulcherrima) in retail nurseries in Cd. Obregon and Navojoa, Sonora, Mexico. A single field sample was collected from broccoli plants in Obregon, Sonora. Both adult whitefly and immature instars were observed on infested leaves. Whiteflies were identified asB. tabaci using morphological characters of the pupae to distinguish them from the greenhouse whitefly; and to specific biotype, by molecular analysis using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) sequence. Phylogenetic analysis of mtCOI sequences indicated that poinsettias were colonized both by the Q and the B biotype. The Q biotype was found only on poinsettia plants, and one poinsettia sample was infested with both the Q and the B biotype. The B biotype alone was associated with the field-collected broccoli sample analyzed in the study. A more extensive survey is required to determine the extent of the distribution of the Q biotype in Mexico, particularly where ornamental plants are transported from central to northern Mexico. Such plants could serve as the source of the Q biotype, which has been reported to be highly resistant to insecticides including the neo-nicotinoids that are widely used to control the B biotype in much of Mexico. This is the first report of the Q biotype in Mexico.
