Distribution of Nitellopsis obtusa (Characeae) in New York, U.S.A
The charophytic green alga Nitellopsis obtusa was first reported in the New World in the St. Lawrence River in 1978. Since that time, N. obtusa has been reported from inland lakes throughout Michigan, northern Indiana, and western New York and has been listed as an aggressive invasive species by the United States Geological Survey. This study addresses the distribution of N. obtusa by surveying 390 waterbodies throughout New York. Previous reports are confirmed and new localities are presented, including new reports from five counties (Franklin, Ontario, Seneca, Wayne, and Yates). In total, N. obtusa was found in 17 counties at 31 sites, including 16 inland lakes, seven sites in the St. Lawrence River, and eight sites in Lake Ontario.
