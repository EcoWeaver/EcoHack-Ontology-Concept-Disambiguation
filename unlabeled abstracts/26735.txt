Environmental factors influencing the biodeposition of the suspension feeding bivalve Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas): Comparison of brackish and freshwater populations
Invasive suspension feeders have been particularly successful in shallow eutrophic estuarine and freshwater ecosystems. The impact of an invasive species is strong under favourable conditions. However, suboptimal feeding conditions may significantly reduce the impact to ambient environment. The invasive bivalve Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas) is able to colonize both fresh and brackish waterbodies. In an in situ experiment the seasonal variability in the biodeposition of D. polymorpha from fresh and brackish water populations was quantified at different temperature, salinity and chlorophyll a (Chl a) regimes. Salinity fluctuations in brackish water areas, temperature and water Chl a content were all important factors in the model of mussels' feeding. The results indicated that D. polymorpha fed significantly more in fresh than in brackish water. Mussels acclimated more easily to acute transfer from brackish to freshwater than vice versa. The biodeposition of zebra mussels increased with temperature and water Chl a content but these effects were less straightforward than that of salinity. The results suggest that the impact of D. polymorpha on recipient ecosystem is more pronounced in fresh than in brackish water environments.
