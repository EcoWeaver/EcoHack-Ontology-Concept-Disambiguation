Invasive mollusc faunas of the River Thames exemplify biostratigraphical characterization of the Anthropocene
Profound changes to the species configuration of ecosystems globally during the 19th to 21st centuries, resulting from the introduction of neobiota, have produced a distinctive palaeontological signature in sedimentary deposits, here exemplified by those of the River Thames. Coring near Teddington Lock (ca. 4.3 m above sea level, ca. 89 km upstream from the mouth of the Thames estuary) yielded dense assemblages of shells of the invasive Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (recently invaded in 2004) and the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha (invaded 1824), which together accounted for 96% of individuals sampled. Population densities of C. fluminea of over 6000 individuals per m2 were maintained for a depth of 1 m indicating that the Asian clam is an important biostratigraphical marker in the Thames for sedimentary deposits accumulating since 2004. The first modern European occurrence of C. fluminea was in Portugal in 1980. In 1987, the first occurrence of C. fluminea on the northern coast of South America was observed in the Caripe River, Venezuela. The non-native range of D. polymorpha was restricted to continental Europe for over 200 years until it appeared in the Great Lakes, USA, in 1986 having been transported in ballast water. Within three years, it reached populations of over 750,000 individuals per m2 and it is presently recorded in 35 states. Therefore, the pan-Atlantic range expansion of D. polymorpha, coupled with the recent invasion history of C. fluminea in Venezuela and Portugal, identifies a biostratigraphical interval in sedimentary deposits forming from the early 1980s that can be correlated between Europe and the Americas.
