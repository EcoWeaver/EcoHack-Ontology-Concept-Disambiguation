Is The invasive amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus the main factor structuring the benthic community across different types of water bodies in the River Rhine system?
Dikerogammarus villosus, one of the most successful invaders in European river systems, is commonly regarded as a threat to native biodiversity and a main factor structuring the benthic community of invaded systems. The impact of D. villosus has been intensively studied in small-scale experiments and field observations, but its impact on natural communities on a larger scale remains unclear. Here, we investigated the benthic community structure at ten sites covering a broad range of habitats along the River Rhine (Central Europe) and its tributaries, to determine whether D. villosus is one of the main factors structuring the benthic community. Community composition was analysed using non-metric multidimensional scaling, distance-based redundancy analysis, and correlation analyses. D. villosus was one of nine relevant taxa present that altogether reflected a large part of the variation in the benthic samples, but further analyses indicated that the species might be less important for the community structure than other relevant taxa. Moreover, all nine relevant taxa together can explain only a similar amount of variation in our samples than the five relevant non-faunal environmental factors (water temperature, pH, conductivity, percentage of medium-sized gravel and macrophytes). Overall, our results suggested that rather a combination of non-faunal environmental factors than D. villosus mainly structure the benthic community composition on this larger spatial scale.
