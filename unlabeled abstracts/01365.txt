Phenological documentation of an invasive species, Sapium sebiferum (L.) Roxb
Phenological documentation and plant invasion are key contemporary issues in the biological sciences. Recognizing this, the present paper describes the phenological stages of an invasive species, Sapium sebiferum (L.) Roxb. A tree of the species was marked, and daily visits were made for recording its phenology. The Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt and CHemical industry (BBCH) scale was used for documenting the same. Of the total ten principal stages, eight were observed in the species. These stages started with bud development (stage 01) in the month of March and ended with leaf fall (stage 97) in the month of December. Descriptions of the phenological stages and their dates are provided in the text. It is hoped that such a phenological scale will be helpful in managing plant invasion.
