Invasive aquatic plants in China
Invasive aquatic plants can cause local losses of species diversity throughout the world and they can also contribute to water quality deterioration. Although widely studied elsewhere, little information exists about invasive aquatic plants and their impacts in China. This study summarizes the taxonomy, origin, vector of introduction, current distribution, and the ecological impacts of invasive aquatic plants in China. This study provides useful information for the management of freshwater habitats and suggests strategies for curtailing the increasing problem of invasive aquatic plants and their impacts. We integrated data based upon original research and a literature review to compile an inventory of invasive aquatic plants in China. In total, we found 152 invasive aquatic plant species belonging to 84 genera and 39 families, representing four major growth forms including emergent (57.24%), submerged (27.63%), rooted floating leaf (9.87%), and free floating (5.26%) categories of aquatic plants. The Poaceae (Gramineae) (23 species) was the most represented and species-rich family, followed by Alismataceae (14 species), Cyperaceae (13 species), Nymphaeaceae and Araceae (both with 10 species). The majority of the invasive aquatic plant species were introduced from South America, and there were also many from North America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Most of these species (96.05%) are obligate freshwater species, while a minority (3.95%) is limited to marine or intertidal habitats. The ornamental trade has been the most frequent historic pathway for the introduction of invasive aquatic plants.
