Effects of body temperature on righting performance of native and invasive freshwater turtles: consequences for competition
Righting behavior of aquatic turtles might be subject to coadaptation pressures between preferred basking temperature and locomotion, given that it is mainly performed on land and may critically determine the survival of turtles. We analyzed the effect of body temperature (T(b)) on righting performance of two species of freshwater turtles, the endangered native Spanish terrapin (Mauremys leprosa), and the red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans), an introduced invasive species that is displacing native turtles in the Iberian Peninsula. Interspecific differences in morphology, basking requirements and behavioral responses have been found between Spanish terrapins and introduced sliders. Therefore, we hypothesized that T(b) might differentially affect righting behavior of these two turtle species. We found a clear effect of T(b) on righting response of both M. leprosa and T. scripta, with the performance enhanced at the preferred basking temperature of each turtle species. These results suggest that righting might be coadapted to preferred basking temperature in freshwater turtles. Also, M. leprosa required longer times to right on average than T. scripta, which denotes a higher efficiency of introduced sliders at righting performance. These interspecific behavioral asymmetries in righting performance between native and exotic turtles might contribute to the greater competitive ability of introduced T. scripta, favoring the expansion of exotic sliders in the new environments in which they are introduced, in detriment to native Spanish terrapins.
