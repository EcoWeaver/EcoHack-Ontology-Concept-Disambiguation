Synflorescence regeneration after cutting in Solidago xniederederi (Asteraceae), a hybrid between invasive S. canadensis and native S. virgaurea
Solidago xniederederi, a natural hybrid between invasive S. canadensis and native S. virgaurea, is considered as naturalized alien taxon in Europe. In this study, we conducted a field experiment on the regeneration ability of S. xniederederi after cutting off its synflorescences (panicles with capitula). The regeneration of synflorescences occurred in 79.6% of the examined shoots (ramets) of the hybrid. After regeneration shoots were significantly shorter and formed shorter, narrower and less branched synflorescences. Moreover, the number of capitula was significantly lower after regeneration as well as number of disc flowers and pollen viability. The obtained results suggest that the hybrid has a high ability of synflorescence regeneration after cutting and one-time cutting at high level during flowering is not effective method to control the hybrid in the wild.
