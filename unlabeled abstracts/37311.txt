Seasonal Dynamics and Plant Preferences ofMegacopta cribraria, an Exotic Invasive Insect Species in the Southeast
Megacopta cribraria (Kudzu Bug) (Hemiptera: Plataspidae) is an invasive insect in the Southeast. In Baldwin County, GA, we found adult Kudzu Bugs at high abundances throughout the summer, while juveniles showed peaks in early July and Sep-tember. We conducted a series of choice-preference tests and determined that the insects preferred Glycine max (Soybean) over Phaseolus lunatus (Lima Bean). Additionally, they preferred Pueraria montana var. lobata (Kudzu) over Soybeans, highlighting the role of Kudzu as a primary host plant. Additionally, Kudzu Bugs continued to feed on Soybeans, even in the presence of Kudzu.
