Positive relationships between invasive purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and plant species diversity and abundance in Minnesota wetlands
Plant species invasions may result from, and cause, changes in the vegetation community and abiotic environment. It is often hypothesized that nonnative plant invaders suppress the diversity of native species. We examined relationships of vegetation and environmental gradients associated with the nonnative invasive wetland plant Lythrum salicaria L. to determine whether L. salicaria invasion is associated with reduced diversity and abundance of resident plant species in the wetland community. Vegetation and environmental variables were surveyed in 10 wetlands defining a gradient of L. salicaria abundance. In addition, relationships among variables were compared between invaded, Lythrum-dominated and uninvaded, Typha-dominated patches within 6 of the 10 invaded wetlands. Contrary to expectations, ordination results showed that plant diversity was higher in invaded than in uninvaded patches. Lythrum salicaria replaced other plant density and biomass on a one-to-one basis. The ordination results generated an unexpected competing set of testable hypotheses regarding whether L. salicaria invades diverse plant communities or enhances plant community diversity.Key words: invasion, Lythrum salicaria, ordination, plant community composition, Typha-dominated marshes, wetlands.
