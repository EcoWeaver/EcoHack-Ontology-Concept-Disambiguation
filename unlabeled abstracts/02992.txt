Eradicating the grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis from urban areas: an innovative decision-making approach based on lessons learnt in Italy
Background: Eradication of Invasive Alien Species supports the recovery of native biodiversity. In Europe, a new Regulation introduces obligations to eradicate the most harmful invasive species. However, eradications of charismatic mammals may encounter strong oppositions. Considering the case study of the Eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis Gmelin, 1788) in central Italy, we developed a structured decision making technique, based on a Bayesian Decision Network model and explicitly considering the plurality of environmental values of invasive species management to reduce potential social conflicts. Results: The model identified priority areas for management activities. These areas corresponded to the core of the grey squirrel range, but they also included peripheral zones, where rapid eradication is fundamental to prevent the spread of squirrels. However, when the model was expanded also integrating the attitude of citizens towards the project, the intervention strategy slightly changed. In some areas, the citizens' support was limited and this resulted in a reduced overall utility of intervention. Conclusion: The suggested approach extends the scientific basis for the management decisions, evaluated in terms of technical efficiency, feasibility and social impact. Here, the Bayesian Decision Network model analysed the potential technical and social consequences of management actions and it responded to the need of transparency in the decision process, but it can be easily extended to consider further issues, common in many mammal eradication programs. Thanks to its flexibility and comprehensiveness, it provides an innovative example of how to plan rapid eradication or control activities, as required by the new EU Regulation.
