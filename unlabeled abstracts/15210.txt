Introduction and spread of non-native parasites withSilurus glanisL. (Teleostei: Siluridae) in UK fisheries
AbstractDespite growing concern of the ecological risks posed by the European catfishSiluris glanisL. in freshwater fisheries, little information exists on the parasite fauna of this silurid catfish in Britain. Parasitological examinations of releasedS. glanisfrom four still-water fisheries in England revealed the presence ofThaparocleidus vistulensis(Siwak, 1932) andErgasilus sieboldi(Nordmann, 1832), both non-native parasites, the latter known to be an important fish pathogen. This represents the first record ofT. vistulensisfrom British freshwater fish. The human-assisted movement ofS. glanisbetween UK recreational still-water fisheries provides a clear avenue for the introduction and spread of non-native parasites.
