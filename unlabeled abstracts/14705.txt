Evaluating the genetic effects of the invasive Ocenebra inornata on the native oyster drill Ocenebra erinacea
Studies focusing on the effect of invasive species on the genetic diversity of native marine invertebrates remain scant. Here we report diversity among French populations of the intertidal gastropod Ocenebra erinacea (Linnaeus, 1758) sampled in the presence and absence of the invasive Ocenebra inornata (Recluz, 1851). Between 1999 and 2004, a total of 352 individuals of O. erinacea was collected from 15 sites (five of which had the invasive present) and was genotyped at the mitochondrial locus Cytochrome Oxidase 1 (cox1). No statistical difference was observed between polymorphism levels recorded within native populations exposed to the invasive, compared with populations sampled in the absence of O. inornata. No sign of native population decline was detected in response to the invader. While significant shifts in native O. erinacea population sizes have previously been reported in the literature, genetic effects may take longer to accumulate, or may be undetectable without a larger panel of genetic markers. By contrast, large genetic distances and significant population differentiation were recorded between Atlantic and Mediterranean O. erinacea samples, suggesting that these populations have distinct evolutionary histories. Comparison of genetic divergence within the closely related genus Nucella suggests that the Atlantic populations of O. erinacea and those from Thau Lagoon in the Mediterranean may belong to different species or subspecies.
