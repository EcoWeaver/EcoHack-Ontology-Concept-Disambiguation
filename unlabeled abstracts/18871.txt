Number of source populations as a potential driver of pine invasions in Brazil
To understand current patterns of Pinus invasion in an Araucaria forest in southern Brazil, we quantified invasion at the local scale and compared it with habitat characteristics, propagule size, and number of source populations, using generalized linear models. We also compared observed and expected invasive species status based on a previously developed model (Z scores) using Chi square and correlation tests to evaluate the predictability of species status based on their traits. Of the 16 Pinus species currently present in the site, three are invasive (P. elliottii, P. glabra, and P. taeda), three are naturalized (P. clausa, P. oocarpa, and P. pseudostrobus), and ten are present only as the originally planted individuals. While P. taeda spread the farthest, P. glabra had greater overall density, but none of the invasive species has spread more than 250 m in 45 years. Invasive Pinus plants were found where forest tree density was below 805 trees ha-1, and invasive Pinus density decreased log-linearly with an increase in native tree density. Number of individuals introduced and number of source populations were strong predictors of naturalization, thus both propagule size and propagule diversity can potentially be driving invasion success. Z scores based on species traits did not predict which species would invade in Rio Negro. Our findings suggest that Araucaria forests might not resist invasion by Pinus as recently suggested and support the hypothesis that propagule pressure is a fundamental driver of invasions with propagule diversity being a possible component of this mechanism.
