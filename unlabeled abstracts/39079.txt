Habitat shapes the thermoregulation of Mediterranean lizards introduced to replicate experimental islets
Both environmental temperatures and spatial heterogeneity can profoundly affect the biology of ectotherms. In lizards, thermoregulation may show high plasticity and may respond to environmental shifts. In the context of global climate change, lizards showing plastic thermoregulatory responses may be favored. In this study, we designed an experiment to evaluate the extent to which lizard thermoregulation responds to introduction to a new environment in a snapshot of time. In 2014, we captured individuals of the Aegean Wall lizard (Podarcis erhardii) from Naxos Island (429.8 km2) and released them onto two small, lizard-free islets, Galiatsos (0.0073 km2) and Kampana (0.004 km2) (Aegean Sea, Greece). In 2017, we returned to the islets and estimated the effectiveness (E), accuracy and precision of thermoregulation measuring operative, preferred (Tpref) and body temperatures. We hypothesized that the three habitats would differ in thermal quality and investigated the extent to which lizards from Naxos demonstrate plasticity when introduced to the novel, islet habitats. Thermal parameters did not differ between Galiatsos and Naxos and this was reflected in the similar E and Tpref. However, lizards from Kampana deviated in all focal traits from Naxos, resulting in higher E and a preference for higher Tpref. In sum, Naxos lizards shifted their thermoregulatory profile due to the idiosyncratic features of their new islet habitat. Our results advocate a high plasticity in lizard thermoregulation and suggest that there is room for effective responses to environmental changes, at least for Podarcis lizards in insular habitats.
