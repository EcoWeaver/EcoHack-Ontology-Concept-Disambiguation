Population abundance and host use pattern ofOphraella communa(Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in its native and introduced range
We found that the abundance of Ophraella communa, a specialist herbivore of the invasive weeds Ambrosia artemisiifolia and A. trifida, is higher in the introduced range than in its native range. We also found that the native O. communa does not feed on A. trifida, but introduced O. communa does so extensively.
