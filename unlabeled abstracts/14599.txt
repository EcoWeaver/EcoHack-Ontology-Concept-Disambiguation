Effects of Salinity on the Photosynthesis of Two Poaceous Halophytes
To explore the difference of C4 and C3 photosynthetic pathways in responding to high salinity and its potential role in determining vegetation zonation in coastal saltmarshes, two Poaceous halophytes, C4Spartina alterniflora and C3Phragmites australis, were studied with different salinities. The results showed that proper salinities were required for both species to maintain optimal photosynthesis. The maximal net assimilation rates of S. alterniflora and P. australis appeared with 400 and 100 mmol L-1 NaCl, respectively. Both species exhibited similar responses of stomatal conductance towards the set salinities, and chlorophyll contents in P. australis were even promoted by 100-400 mmol L-1 NaCl. Although no significant changes in the maximal quantum yield of photosystem II were found in either species treated by NaCl, instant quantum yield of photosystem II of P. australis was significantly decreased, whereas that of S. alterniflora increased. We suggest that the zonation between S. alterniflora and P. australis is not exclusively caused by the CO2-concentrating mechanism of the C4 pathway and stomatal conductance is not a restricting factor for either species. It might be that the electron transfer from photosystem II and the energy use efficiency being limited in the C3P. australis grown under high salinity.
