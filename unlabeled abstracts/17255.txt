Nesting ecology of the exotic Trachemys scripta elegans in an area of Southern Italy (Angitola Lake, Calabria)
The nesting ecology of the slider turtle Trachemys scripta elegans was studied in Angitola Lake, a natural protected area in Calabria (Southern Italy). During 2008-2010, data were collected based on 1081 egg shells from 250 nests. The average number of egg shells per nest was 4.3 (min-max = 1-16) and the clutch size increased from 2008 to 2010. Two main hatching periods were identified: one in July and another in September. There were significant correlations between nest diameter and nest depth, between nest diameter and egg shell number, and between nest depth and egg shell number.
