An Automated Content Analysis of Forestry Research: Are Socioecological Challenges Being Addressed?
Forests worldwide are increasingly threatened by a wide range of human-induced socioecological challenges, such as urbanization, invasive species, and climate change. Using automated content analysis, we analyzed 14,855 abstracts published in seven prominent applied forestry journals between 2000 and 2013 to determine the degree to which these publications are providing forest managers with the information needed to address these challenges. We found that most articles still focus on more traditional forestry topics (e.g., silviculture and timber harvesting), with limited evidence of effort to address socioecological challenges. Although these traditional topics are essential to forest management, framing this research within the broader context of contemporary socioecological challenges will improve forest managers' abilities to address these challenges and contribute to the sustainability of forest ecosystems.
