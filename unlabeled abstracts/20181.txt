The importance of open data for invasive alien species research, policy and management
Rapidly changing environmental conditions and the increasing establishment of invasive alien species present many challenges for policy makers, managers and researchers. The traditional policies for data management, or lack thereof, are obstructing an adequate response to invasive alien species, which requires accurate and up-to-date information. This information can only be provided if data regarding invasive alien species are available and useable by all, irrespective of country, status or purpose. The best way forward is for researchers to publish their data openly, by making use of repositories in which the data are licenced in a permissive manner, while making sure they are credited by the adequate provision of citation. Reducing the barriers to data sharing will improve our ability to respond to the growing issue of biological invasions.
