Invasive exotic shrub (Rhamnus cathartica ) alters the timing and magnitude of post-dispersal seed predation of native and exotic species
Invasive exotic plants may generate deleterious indirect effects on native species, such as increasing consumer pressure on native plants (i.e. apparent competition). Although rarely examined, invasive shrubs may create novel pulses of consumer pressure because their leaves senesce later, providing temporal increases in cover. Apparent competition generated by invasive species may have a strong temporal signal due to extended phenologies of invasive plants. Using an experimental manipulation of the invasive shrub, Rhamnus cathartica, we evaluated whether seed predation of multiple species is higher in invaded areas, and if the novel extended phenology of R. cathartica leads to temporal changes in seed predation.
