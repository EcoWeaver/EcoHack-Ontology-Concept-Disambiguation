Propagating Native Species: Experience at the Wind River Nursery
Propagation information developed at the USDA Forest Service Wind River Nursery in Carson, WA, is provided for 9 hardwood tree and 30 shrub species native to the Pacific Northwest. This includes information on: seed collection, extraction, stratification, and storage; timing of collection and propagation techniques for cuttings; and a summary of propagation experience (planting media and container used, specialized methods, and type of stock produced). Most species were propagated from seed, some from stem or root cuttings, and some from both seed and cuttings. Some species were very difficult or impossible to propagate at the nursery.
