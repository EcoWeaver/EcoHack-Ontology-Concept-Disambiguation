Interactions between alien goldenrods (Solidago and Euthamia species) and comparison with native species in Central Europe
Competitive interactions are among the crucial determinants of plant invasion. Most invasive species are more competitive than native species, with the strongest competition expected between species that share similar niches and/or those that are closely related. Because many habitats can be invaded by several non-native species, the competition between alien plants has an increasing importance. The American-origin goldenrods (Solidago and Euthamia) are exceptionally successful invaders in Europe. A replacement series experiment was performed, to identify the interactions between goldenrods in their invasive range. We determined what type of interferences dominated between the examined taxa by comparing the total yield of plants in mixtures and as a monoculture. Four alien goldenrods [Solidago altissima L., Solidago canadensis L., Solidago gigantea Aiton and Euthamia graminifolia (L) Nutt] were studied and compared with native species (Solidago virgaurea L. and Tanacetum vulgare L) that co-occur with them in natural conditions. The results show that the invasive Solidago species had similar competitive abilities. The invasive species that were examined, out-competed the native taxa. These results highlight the high competitiveness of E. graminifolia, which reduced the biomass of the other species. Such competitive abilities were related to underground competition. These results suggest the necessity to monitor this species as a potentially invasive taxon.
