Erratum to: Linking calcification by exotic snails to stream inorganic carbon cycling
Biotic calcification is rarely considered in freshwater C budgets, despite calculations suggesting that calcifying animals can alter inorganic C cycling. Most studies that have quantified biocalcification in aquatic ecosystems have not directly linked CO 2 fluxes from biocalci-fication with whole-ecosystem rates of inorganic C cycling. The freshwater snail, Melanoides tuberculata, has achieved a high abundance and 37.4 g biomass m-2 after invading Kelly Warm Springs in Grand Teton National Park. This high biomass suggests that introduced populations of Mel-anoides may alter ecosystem processes. We measured Melanoides growth rates and biomass to calculate the production of biomass, shell mass, and CO 2. We compared Melanoides biomass and inorganic C production with ecosystem C pools and fluxes, as well as with published rates of CO 2 production by other calcifying organisms. Melano-ides calcification in Kelly Warm Springs produced 12.1 mmol CO 2 m-2 day-1 during summer months. We measured high rates of gross primary productivity and respiration in Kelly Warm Springs (-378 and 533 mmol CO 2 m-2 day-1 , respectively); CO 2 produced from bio-calcification increased net CO 2 production in Kelly Warm Springs from 155 to 167 mmol CO 2 m-2 day-1. This rate of CO 2 production via biocalcification is within the published range of calcification by animals. But these CO 2 fluxes are small when compared to ecosystem C fluxes from stream metabolism. The influence of animals is relative to ecosystem processes, and should always be compared with ecosystem fluxes to quantify the importance of a specific animal in its environment.
