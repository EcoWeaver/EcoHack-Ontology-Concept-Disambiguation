Limited effects of non-native trout on microcrustacean zooplankton in boreal foothills lakes: comparisons of stocked, unstocked, and fishless lakes
Stocking lakes with trout can have strong effects on native communities; however, the nature of impacts is not universal across receiving ecosystems. To assess effects of non-native trout, relative to native small-bodied fish, on microcrustacean zooplankton, we compared stocked, unstocked (but fish-bearing), and fishless lakes in the boreal foothills of Alberta, Canada. Relative to unstocked lakes, stocked lakes had greater richness, but otherwise showed few additional effects on microcrustacean communities. In contrast, fishless lakes supported lower abundances of Cladocera, Calanoida, and Cyclopoida, but were dominated by larger cladoceran and calanoid taxa, compared with fish-bearing lakes (stocked and unstocked). Vertical distributions also differed significantly among lake types; microcrustaceans had far higher relative abundances at 1 m than at 2 m in fishless lakes compared with fish-bearing lakes (distributions in stocked and unstocked lakes were similar). Microcrustacean communities in fishless lakes were likely shaped by the invertebrate planktivore Chaoborus, which was abundant in these systems, whereas native fishes likely structured microcrustacean communities prior to trout introductions, with planktivory by trout causing few additional effects.
