The first invasive bivalve in African fresh waters: invasion portrait and management options
The first clear evidence of the establishment of an invasive freshwater bivalve in Africa is provided, through the description of the distribution of Corbicula fluminea in Morocco.C. fluminea was detected in 2008 and 2011 in two independent river basins, although still absent in other river systems throughout the country.This information is used to propose management actions, which should be focused on avoiding interbasin expansion as well as new introduction events from European fresh waters.
