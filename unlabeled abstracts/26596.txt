Competitive interactions between native and exotic earthworm species as influenced by habitat quality in a California grassland
Worldwide, anthropogenic disturbance has contributed to reductions in native earthworm abundance and diversity and subsequent establishment of exotic populations. Exotic earthworm species dominate the earthworm community primarily in nutrient-enriched soils characteristic of urbanized and rural areas, while native species persist in less disturbed habitat. We hypothesized that exotic species may displace native species through competitive interactions, but only under conditions of high resource availability. To test this we manipulated both grassland productivity and the presence and density of intra- and interspecific competitors in field and laboratory experiments with two common species, the native megascolecid Argilophilus marmoratus Eisen 1893 and the exotic lumbricid Aporrectodea trapezoides Duges 1828.
