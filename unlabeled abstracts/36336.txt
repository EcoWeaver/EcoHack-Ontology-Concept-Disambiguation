Stakeholder Opinions on Invasive Species and Their Management in the San Marcos River
The San Marcos River in Texas supports a wide diversity of aquatic organisms and provides critical habitat for eight endangered species. It is also a highly invaded ecosystem, with 48 documented introduced species. Several of these are invasive and known to negatively impact native species. Increasing pressure to control or eradicate invasive species exists to mitigate their impacts. Management programs can be controversial and, in some cases, have been delayed or stopped because of public opposition. People who have a vested interest in an invaded ecosystem, stakeholders, may be the most likely to express opposition or offer support for invasive species control. Understanding opinions can help guide educational outreach to gain public support for management programs. To assess stakeholder's opinions of invasive species (defined as species that cause harm to the environment or human health), a survey instrument was distributed, and 335 completed surveys were analyzed. The majority of survey participants believed nonnative, invasive species should be controlled to conserve the environment (84.4%), where they damage native Texas species (75.9%), and in particular when they threaten rare Texas native species (89%). Proposed management methods influenced levels of support for invasive species control. Significant differences among demographic groups were found in membership in environmental organizations, knowledge of invasive species in the river, and sources of information on invasive species.
