Landscape Position Influences the Distribution of Garlic Mustard, an Invasive Species
We investigated the distribution and abundance of Alliaria petiolata, an invasive biennial, with respect to historical land use, and examined environmental conditions to look for correlations with distribution patterns. Sixty currently forested plots in Cuyahoga Valley National Park, OH were chosen based on 1959 land use: agricultural (open) versus forested. Plots were analyzed for Garlic Mustard distribution, abundance, invasion area, and incursion distance. Garlic Mustard distribution did not vary with historical land use, but did vary significantly with distance from rivers and with elevation. Polygon area:perimeter values were also correlated with invasion. These results differ from studies done with Garlic Mustard in New England where historical land use appeared to be a larger factor in distribution. These results suggest the importance of landscape corridors in biological invasions and can be used to identify areas with greater potential for invasive species in this region.
