EFFECTIVENESS OF SELECTIVE FISHING METHODS ON STRUGGLE AGAINST INVASIVE FISH SPECIES IN INLAND WATERS
Invasive fish species pose major threats to fisheries, aquaculture and biological diversity. These threats are occurred by invasion of habitats and predation on local fish species, and cause rapidly to vanish of endemic species and collapse fisheries production.At present the scientists in many fields focus on the presence and distributions of invasive fish, but there are less studies about invasive species on decontamination from infested watersheds. In this paper, effectiveness of selective fishing methods on control of invasive species in infested inland waters has been reviewed. The possibilities of removing invasive species from watershed and increasing catch pressure on these species were discussed by using results both practical studies and common international applications. As a result, specially designed fishing traps and pots can be used expediently to struggle against invasive fish species in inland waters
