The rapid evolution of self-fertility in Spartina hybrids (Spartina alterniflora x foliosa) invading San Francisco Bay, CA
Plant hybridization can lead to the evolution of invasiveness. We wished to determine whether hybrids between the largely self-sterile Atlantic Spartina alterniflora and California native S. foliosa had evolved self-fertility during their ca 30year existence in San Francisco Bay, CA. In pollination experiments we found that neither of the parental species was self-fertile, nor were early generation hybrids. A large fraction of later generation hybrids were profusely self-fertile. Inbreeding depression was high in the parental species and early generation hybrids, but was much reduced in later generation hybrids--some even showed outbreeding depression. We found that populations of later generation hybrids and their seedling progeny were almost two-fold more homozygous than early generation hybrids, consistent with the evidence of increased selfing shown by our parentage analyses based upon 17 microsatellite markers. We posit that evolved self-fertility has contributed substantially to the rapid spread of hybrid Spartina in San Francisco Bay.
