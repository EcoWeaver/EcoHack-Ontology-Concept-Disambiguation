Effects of Disturbance on Herbaceous Exotic Plant Species on the Floodplain of the Potomac River
The objective of this study was to investigate specific effects of disturbance on exotic species in floodplain environments and to provide baseline data on the abundance of exotic herbs in the Potomac River floodplain. Frequency of exotics generally increased with man-made disturbance (forest fragmentation and recreational use of land) and decreased with increasing flooding frequency. Species richness of exotics followed a similar pattern. Some variation was found in individual species' responses to disturbance. The spread of Alliaria officinalis and Glecoma hederacea, the most frequent exotic species, was inhibited by forest fragmentation.
