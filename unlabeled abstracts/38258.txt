Amblycerus robiniae (Fabricius, 1781) (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae), an alien species established in Europe
After more than 30 years from the first and only record of Amblycerus robiniae in Europe (Kecskemet, Hungary), two new established populations are reported. The new records came from Romania, 210-250 km away from the initial record, suggesting the possibility that the species was already established in Hungary and that it spread slowly to the southeast. Gleditsia triacanthos Linnaeus, 1753 seed pods were collected in order to detect the species and assess its abundance and frequency. The emerging adults were reared in laboratory conditions to collect information regarding its parasitoids and pest potential. Information regarding rearing, life cycle and biology of the species are also provided.
