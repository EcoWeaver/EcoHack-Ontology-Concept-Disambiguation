Invasive fish threat in Manyas Lake (Turkey)
Two non-native freshwater fish species, Gambusia holbrooki Girard, 1859 and Pseudorasbora parva (Temminck & Schlegel, 1846) were recorded for the first time for the Manyas Lake, and the number of the non-native fish species living in the lake has increased to three. These non-native fish species described as invasive were considered as new threats to the lake, which is already threatened by eutrophication and habitat degradation.
