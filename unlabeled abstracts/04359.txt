GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION AMONG ANCESTRAL AND INTRODUCED POPULATIONS OF THE EURASIAN TREE SPARROW (PASSER MONTANUS).
We compared genetic variation in three introduced North American populations of Passer montanus with an ancestral German population, a native Swedish population, and an introduced Australian population. The North American P montanus were less variable genetically than the ancestral German birds, presumably a result of the founding event. The genetic structure of all six populations of P montanus can be explained in terms of interaction among mutation, genetic drift, effective population size, and unknown selective factors. Cluster analyses and an ordination of distance measures derived from electrophoretic data generally showed relationships in phenetic space among populations consistent with the magnitude of their geographic separation. An exception occurred with the Swedish population, which was closer in the ordination to a North American population than to the geographically neighboring German population. This seemingly anomolous juxtaposition was attributed to the relative abundance of alleles present in the Swedish birds. Populations of P montanus seem to have diverged in a manner similar to that seen in conspecific disjunct populations, i.e., at present showing no trenchant indication of genetic speciation.
