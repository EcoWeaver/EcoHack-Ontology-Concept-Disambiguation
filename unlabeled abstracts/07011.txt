Expansion of the neuropeptidome of the globally invasive marine crab Carcinus maenas
Carcinus maenas is widely recognized as one of the world's most successful marine invasive species; its success as an invader is due largely to its ability to thrive under varied environmental conditions. The physiological/behavioral control systems that allow C. maenas to adapt to new environments are undoubtedly under hormonal control, the largest single class of hormones being peptides. While numerous studies have focused on identifying native C. maenas peptides, none has taken advantage of mining transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA) sequence data, a strategy proven highly successful for peptide discovery in other crustaceans. Here, a C. maenas peptidome was predicted via in silico transcriptome mining. Thirty-seven peptide families were searched for in the extant TSA database, with transcripts encoding precursors for 29 groups identified. The pre/preprohormones deduced from the identified sequences allowed for the prediction of 263 distinct mature peptides, 193 of which are new discoveries for C. maenas. The predicted peptides include isoforms of adipokinetic hormone-corazonin-like peptide, allatostatin A, allatostatin B, allatostatin C, bursicon, CCHamide, corazonin, crustacean cardioactive peptide, crustacean hyperglycemic hormone, diuretic hormone 31, diuretic hormone 44, eclosion hormone, FMRFamide-like peptide, HIGSLYRamide, intocin, leucokinin, myosuppressin, neuroparsin, neuropeptide F, orcokinin, pigment dispersing hormone, proctolin, pyrokinin, red pigment concentrating hormone, RYamide, short neuropeptide F, SIFamide, and tachykinin-related peptide. This peptidome is the largest predicted from any single crustacean using the in silico approach, and provides a platform for investigating peptidergic signaling in C. maenas, including control of the processes that allow for its success as a global marine invader.
