Does invasive plant management aid the restoration of natural ecosystems?
Invasive alien plants of natural ecosystems, commonly referred to as weeds, can reduce the abundance and diversity of native flora and fauna, and alter ecosystem processes. Using Australia's 20 'Weeds of National Significance' (WoNS), we investigated how natural ecosystems responded following their management. We reviewed the literature and surveyed land managers involved in WoNS management programs by distributing a questionnaire through various e-mail networks. While most of the 95 papers reviewed measured the effect of management on the target WoNS, only 18 assessed the response of other plant species. In these studies, native plant species did not necessarily recover following management and in many instances the managed WoNS was replaced by other weed species. Three other studies investigated the response of invertebrate communities and an ecosystem process following WoNS management but none examined the response of vertebrates or microbial communities. A total of 168 replies were received to the land manager survey. Of the 142 land managers who evaluated their WoNS management program, 86 monitored the response of native plant species and/or other weeds, mostly using qualitative assessments. These managers reported no vegetation response after management of the WoNS (7%) or re-colonisation by a combination of native and weed species (52%) or only by native plants (33%) or the targeted WoNS (2%). Our results emphasise the need to select sites for weed management that are less degraded and thus have a higher likelihood of natural recovery and/or to incorporate activities that facilitate recovery of native plant communities in conjunction with weed removal.
