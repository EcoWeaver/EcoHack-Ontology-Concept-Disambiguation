THE AUSTRALIAN DISTRIBUTION OF THE INTRODUCED SPHAEROMATID ISOPOD, PARACERCEIS SCULPTA
The sphaeromatid isopod. Paracerceis sculpta, identified for the first time in Australia at Townsville. Queensland. in 1982 (from a collection made in 1975) is a native of the Pacific Coast of North and Central America and has a wide global introduced distribution. We report on the distribution of P. sculpta in Australia based primarily on a series of port surveys specifically designed to detect introduced fauna and supplemented by museum records. Based on its current distribution and the local abundance at specific sites, P. sculpta is primarily associated with and likely to be transported by hull fouling, although it may rarely be transported by ballast water. Paracerceis sculpta is likely to continue its expansion in Australian waters either through coastal (domestic) translocations or directly from overseas.
