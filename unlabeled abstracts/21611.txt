Origin, diffusion and reproduction of the giant reed (Arundo donax L.): a promising weedy energy crop
Giant reed (Arundo donax) is a promising energy crop of the Mediterranean areas. It has long been associated with humans and has been cultivated in Asia, southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East for thousands of years. It is a perennial herbaceous plant (Poaceae) found in grasslands and wetlands throughout a wide range of climatic zones. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis was used to assess genetic inter and intrarelationships between A. donax and other Arundo species. Furthermore, the development of the sexual apparatus was analysed to understand the basis of sterility in the accession examined. The dendrograms obtained by phenetic and cladistic analysis support the monophyletic origin of giant reed and suggest that it originated in Asia and began to spread into the Mediterranean without traces of hybridisation with the other Arundo species. In particular, samples from Mediterranean areas are characterisd by a lower gene diversity and incidence of rare AFLP fragments indicating that these populations are recent in origin. Moreover, results indicate the occurrence of post-meiotic alterations in the ovule and pollen developmental pathway. Thus, the success of giant reed can be attributed mainly to its rapid clonal spread by rhizome extension, flood dispersal of rhizome and culm fragments.
