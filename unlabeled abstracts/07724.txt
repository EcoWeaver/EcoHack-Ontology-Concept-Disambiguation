Invading populations of an ornamental shrub show rapid life history evolution despite genetic bottlenecks.
Human-mediated species introductions offer opportunities to investigate when and how non-native species to adapt to novel environments, and whether evolution has the potential to contribute to colonization success. Many long-established introductions harbour high genetic diversity, raising the possibility that multiple introductions of genetic material catalyze adaptation and/or the evolution of invasiveness. Studies of nascent invasions are rare but crucial for understanding whether genetic diversity facilitates population expansion. We explore variation and evolution in founder populations of the invasive shrub Hypericum canariense. We find that these introductions have experienced large reductions in genetic diversity, but that increased growth and a latitudinal cline in flowering phenology have nevertheless evolved. These life history changes are consistent with predictions for invasive plants. Our results highlight the potential for even genetically depauperate founding populations to adapt and evolve invasive patters of spread.
