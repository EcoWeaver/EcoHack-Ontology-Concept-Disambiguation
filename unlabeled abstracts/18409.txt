Ecological determinants of parasite acquisition by exotic fish species
Disease-mediated threats posed by exotic species to native counterparts are not limited to introduced parasites alone, since exotic hosts frequently acquire native parasites with possible consequences for infection patterns in native hosts. Several biological and geographical factors are thought to explain both the richness of parasites in native hosts, and the invasion success of free-living exotic species. However, the determinants of native parasite acquisition by exotic hosts remain unknown. Here, we investigated native parasite communities of exotic freshwater fish to determine which traits influence acquisition of native parasites by exotic hosts. Model selection suggested that five factors (total body length, time since introduction, phylogenetic relatedness to the native fish fauna, trophic level and native fish species richness) may be linked to native parasite acquisition by exotic fish, but 95% confidence intervals of coefficient estimates indicated these explained little of the variance in parasite richness. Based on R2-values, weak positive relationships may exist only between the number of parasites acquired and either host size or time since introduction. Whilst our results suggest that factors influencing parasite richness in native host communities may be less important for exotic species, it seems that analyses of general ecological factors currently fail to adequately incorporate the physiological and immunological complexity of whether a given animal species will become a host for a new parasite.
