Phytosociological characteristics and diversity of trees in a comanaged protected area of Bangladesh: Implications for conservation
The Chunati wildlife sanctuary (CWS), a degraded protected area in south-eastern Bangladesh, had been under co-management since 2004. This study examined phytosociological characteristics and diversity of trees in CWS and discussed villagers' opinion on the impact of co-management on forest conservation. Following a stratified and systematic sampling 140 circular plots, 17.84 m radius each, were laid out in seven forest beats for the assessment of phytosociological characteristics and tree diversity. Several key-informant interviews and 15 focus group discussions were held to explore the impact of co-management on forest conservation and on villagers' livelihood. A total of 93 tree species were identified having a diameter at breast height (dbh) of >=5 cm in 36 plant families. The dominant species were Acacia auriculiformis, Dipterocarpus turbinatus, Ficus hispida and Tectona grandis. The average density of trees was 239 trees/ha of which 60% was composed of planted exotic species. Nearly 90% trees were belonging to 5-15 cm dbh class and the Shannon-Wiener index was 3.15. The co-management governance had brought positive changes in forest conservation. However, to sustain the engagement of poor villagers in the co-management and conservation of degraded CWS more collective efforts are needed to support their living.
