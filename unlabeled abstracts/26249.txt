Pachydellus hades(Halliday) (Acari: Pachylaelapidae), a European mite species described from Australia
Pachydellus hades (Halliday) (Acari: Pachylaelapidae) was described from Jenolan Caves, NSW, Australia, and was thought to be an Australian endemic species. It is now known that this species is abundant in Slovakia and other parts of Europe, but its presence there was not recognised because it had been misidentified as other species. It appears likely that this species was introduced from Europe into Australia through human activities. The Australian type locality of this species gives a misleading impression of its native range.
