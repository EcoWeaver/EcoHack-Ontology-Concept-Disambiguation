Non-native fishes in Brazilian freshwaters: identifying biases and gaps in ecological research
Brazil is the country in the world with the highest freshwater fish diversity. Because of the high rates of species introduction, the number of publications about invasive fish has increased in the last decades in this country. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify knowledge patterns and gaps related to the introduction of non-native fishes in distinct Brazilian freshwater ecosystems. Compared to the last official report, we found that the number of records in the literature is three times greater, with at least 352 non-native freshwater fish species (255 translocated and 97 exotics). Studies were concentrated in developed and impacted regions of the country and were mostly conducted in reservoirs and rivers. Only 7% of the studies tested invasion hypotheses, mainly those in the so-called Darwin's and trait concept clusters. Studies that assessed the effects of non-native species investigated a few species, such as Oreochromis niloticus, Coptodon rendalli, or Cichla kelberi. However, the impacts of most species, especially those translocated among Brazilian ecoregions, remain largely unexplored. Therefore, the fish invasion literature in Brazil still has relevant knowledge gaps, biases, and research topics needing investigation. This picture prevents a proper understanding of the ecological and socio-economic consequences of fish introductions to native ecosystems, especially in highly biodiverse regions such as the Amazon. Future research and government agendas should fill these knowledge gaps to allow the establishment of effective surveillance, control, and management programs for non-native fishes in Brazilian freshwaters.
