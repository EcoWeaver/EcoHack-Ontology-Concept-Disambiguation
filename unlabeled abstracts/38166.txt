The dilemma of Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus): a valued pasture grass and a highly invasive species
On a global scale, invasive grasses threaten biodiversity and ecosystem function. Nevertheless, the importation of forage grasses is a significant economic force driven by globalization. Pastureland and rangeland are of critical economic and ecological importance, but novel grass species may lead to invasion. Recognizing that economically important species can also be ecologically damaging creates a contentious debate for land managers, policymakers, and ecologists alike. Many Afrotropical perennial grass species have been intentionally introduced pantropically given their high forage production and resistance to stress. However, these traits may also confer competitive ability, increasing the possibility of unintended escape and invasion. Further, these traits have posed challenges for traditional control methods using chemicals, prescribed fire, and mowing. The use of classic biological control may alleviate the ecological impact in invaded areas. In this literature synthesis we examine Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus); whose economic value in many countries is undeniable, yet its impact on native ecosystems is a mounting concern. First, we introduce Guinea grass taxonomy, general biology and ecology, and the geographic and genetic origins. Second, we review the economic value and the ecological impacts. Third, we review the control of Guinea grass in undesired areas using chemical and mechanical means. Finally, we review current efforts to use biological control.
