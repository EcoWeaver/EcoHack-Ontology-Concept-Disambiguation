IveGot1: Reporting and Tracking Invasive Species in Florida
Several agencies and programs within the state of Florida formed the Everglades Cooperative Invasive Species Management Area (Everglades CISMA) to collaborate and share information about the invasive species that threaten the region's ecosystems. In 2010, the Everglades CISMA contracted with the Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health (Bugwood) to implement EDDMapS as the database to store and share data collected by their programs and to develop and maintain a website and a smartphone application designed for professionals and citizen scientists to report invasive species. The project, IveGot1, has been a categorical success and has become a model for invasive species reporting nationwide. As of May 2015, members had submitted 3481 website records, 1178 smartphone records, and 248,571 records from bulk data-uploads.
