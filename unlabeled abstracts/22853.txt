Quantifying Predation on Galaxiids and Other Native Organisms by Introduced Rainbow Trout in an Ultraoligotrophic Lake in Northern Patagonia, Argentina: A Bioenergetics Modeling Approach
Exotic rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss support an economically valuable recreational fishery in Patagonia but also create concern for impacts on native organisms. These concerns are intensified by the possibility of hatchery release programs in this region. We estimated losses of different prey from predation by rainbow trout in Lake Moreno, Rio Negro Province, Argentina, using a bioenergetics model combined with input data from directed sampling on growth, seasonal diet, distribution, and thermal experience. The fish community was sampled seasonally using gill nets, hydroacoustics, and ichthyoplankton
