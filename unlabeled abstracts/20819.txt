Forest dynamics following eastern hemlock mortality in the southern Appalachians
Understanding changes in community composition caused by invasive species is critical for predicting effects on ecosystem function, particularly when the invasive threatens a foundation species. Here we focus on dynamics of forest structure, composition and microclimate, and how these interact in southern Appalachian riparian forests following invasion by hemlock woolly adelgid, HWA, Adelges tsugae. We measured and quantified changes in microclimate; canopy mortality; canopy and shrub growth; understory species composition; and the cover and diversity in riparian forests dominated by eastern hemlock Tsuga canadensis over a period of seven years. Treatments manipulated hemlock mortality either through invasion (HWA infested stands) or girdling (GDL) hemlock trees.
