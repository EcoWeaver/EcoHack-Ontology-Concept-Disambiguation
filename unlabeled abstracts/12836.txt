Progress and prospect in the integrated development of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) sector in Uttarakhand, Western Himalaya
Conservation, sustainable utilization and cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) have received much attention in the recent years. MAPs are important ecosystem service, and dependence on MAPs for sustaining livelihood in the developing regions is still high. Despite, the tradition of trade, priorities and practices for integrated development of MAPs sector in developing regions, including the entire Indian Himalayan Region are inadequate. Uttarakhand (India--Western Himalaya), is pioneer in categorizing potential MAPs, determining priorities and developing practices for integrated development of MAPs. On the basis of regional agro-climatic conditions, available MAPs resources and prospect, a total of 132 indigenous and exotic species of MAPs in the Uttarakhand are categorized as substantial. In addition, a total of 28 plans for integrated development of MAPs sector through four prioritized areas (6 plans for coordination, 5 for research, education and documentation, 3 for conservation and sustainable development and 14 for cultivation and marketing) are introduced in past 10-12 years. Recent facilitations in the sustainable harvesting, cultivation and marketing have enabled to achieve the considerable progress in production of planting materials, promotional cultivation and sustainable harvesting and marketing. MAPs produce from cultivation-associated sources, having an economic value of Rs. 93.90 lakhs to 294.60 lakhs (cf. to US $ 147,479.19-462,698.29.00) from 2007-08 to 2012-13, and produce obtained through sustainable harvesting with the value of Rs. 321.54 lakhs to 1,791.00 lakhs (cf. to US $ 505,010.21-2,812,941.73) from 2003-04 to 2012-13 was marketed from Uttarakhand. Even though, the facilitation-driven progress in MAPs sector is encouraging; however, considering some key aspects for ascertaining sustainability and competence in the MAPs sector are still required. An attempt is made to describe decadal progress in the MAPs sector in Uttarakhand with associated and expected prospect.
