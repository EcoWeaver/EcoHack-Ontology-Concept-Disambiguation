Sex differences in the morphological defenses of an invasive snail: dimorphism and predator-induced plasticity
Invasive species often show greater morphological plasticity than do native species. This plasticity increases their ability to evade predation, but differences in morphological defenses between sexes, including both dimorphism and predator-induced plasticity, remain poorly understood. We measured multiple shell characteristics of male and female adults of the invasive freshwater snail Pomacea canaliculata after they had been exposed to predation cues from the caged turtle Trachemys scripta elegans for 30 d. Regardless of sex, P. canaliculata individuals exhibited greater shell crushing (i.e., higher shell strength) and shell entry (i.e., smaller opercula) resistance characteristics and a narrower shape under predator-induced stress. Moreover, the snails exhibited sexual dimorphism in shell shape and strength characteristics. The shell crushing resistance capability of males was stronger than that of females in both the presence and absence of non-consumptive effects of predators, a difference that could be linked to shell thickness, mass, and calcium concentration. However, females had smaller opercula than males regardless of the presence of predators, which might allow them to better resist predator attacks on snail flesh via the aperture. The snails exhibited sex-specific body size plasticity responses to the predation threat such that shell height growth of females was inhibited in the presence of predators, whereas the shell height of males was unaffected. In general, males appeared to have stronger morphological defenses than females. These results indicate that energy allocation to shell morphological defense, growth, and reproduction differ between the 2 sexes under non-consumptive effects of predators, which might be a result of their different morphology and reproductive roles.
