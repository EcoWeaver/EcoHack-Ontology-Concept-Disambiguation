Physical-Ecological Interactions in a Lowland River System: Large Wood, Hydraulic Complexity and Native Fish Associations in the River Murray, Australia
Associations between channel morphology and the distribution and character of large woody debris (LWD) within a 95-km reach of the River Murray, Australia were examined at different scales. At the reach scale there was a uniform pattern of LWD distribution along the river. Most LWD was associated with eroding sites, close to the bank and aligned at 90deg or less to the flow. At the sub-reach scale (0.5-1.5 km) strong associations were found between the curvature of the river channel and LWD distribution. Distribution patterns at this scale suggest that LWD is mainly recruited by bank erosion and falls into the river perpendicular to the flow. It subsequently remains close to where it falls and is realigned rather than actively moved by the river. Within meander bends there was twice as much LWD along the outer bank as there was along the inner bank, and while the amount on the inner bank declined with increasing distance into the bend the reverse was true for the outer bank.
