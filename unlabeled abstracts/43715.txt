A service-oriented framework for controlling invasive species in agriculture
The Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) has killed or infested millions of ash trees in the USA. It has the potential to decimate ash trees as a component of North American forests, which will have dramatic ecological and economic effects. Government agencies have joined forces to implement a long-term programme to contain and eventually eradicate the borer. One key requirement for the success of this programme is the underlying information-sharing infrastructure. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based service-oriented framework, called Sentinel, to automate the dissemination of EAB-related information. We also present experiment results to assess the performance of our framework.
