Present knowledge on earthworm biodiversity in the State of Parana, Brazil
In this paper we summarize the current knowledge on earthworm biodiversity in the State of Parana, Brazil. Up to the present, 54 species of earthworms are known from the State, belonging to seven families and 19 genera. Native species (N=34), dominated over exotics (N=20). The most widespread exotics were Pontoscolex corethrurus (Glossoscolecidae) and several Amynthas spp. (Megascolecidae) and Dichogaster spp. (Acanthodrilidae), generally associated with anthropogenic sites. Of the native species, most (17 spp.) were in the genus Glossoscolex, frequently encountered in chronically wet soils. Further work is warranted, particularly more sampling efforts, but also ecological studies, given the potential biodiversity and agro-ecological importance of earthworms in Parana.
