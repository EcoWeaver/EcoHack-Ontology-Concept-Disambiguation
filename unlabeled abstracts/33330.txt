First record of North American fungus Rhizopogon pseudoroseolus in Australia and prediction of its occurrence based on climatic niche and symbiotic partner preferences
In 2017 a North American fungus, Rhizopogon pseudoroseolus (Boletales, Basidiomycota), formerly known in Oceania as only occurring in New Zealand, was found for the first time in South Australia. The morphological identification of collected specimens was confirmed using an internal transcribed spacer barcoding approach. In this study, the biogeography of R. pseudoroseolus is also presented, based on sporocarp and ectomycorrhiza records. Species distribution modeling implemented in MaxEnt was used to estimate the distribution of the potential range of R. pseudoroseolus in Australia and New Zealand. The obtained model illustrates, in the background of climatic variables and distribution of a symbiotic partner, its wide range of suitable habitats in New Zealand, South-East Australia, and Tasmania. Precipitation of the coldest quarters and annual mean temperature are important factors influencing the potential distribution of the fungus. The occurrence of Pinus radiata, the ectomycorrhizal partner of R. pseudoroseolus, is also an important factor limiting expansion of the fungus' invasion range.
