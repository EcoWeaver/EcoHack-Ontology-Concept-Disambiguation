Variation between mite communities in Irish forest types - Importance of bark and moss cover in canopy
Extensive afforestation took place in Ireland during the twentieth century and the forest cover currently represents about 10% of the land area. However, approximately 50% of this forest is Sitka spruce, a non-native species introduced from the North Western United States of America. Little is known about the microarthopods of these forests and the current study examined the mites (Oribatida and Gamasina) occurring in the canopy, moss (both on the soil surface and in the canopy) and soil of oak, ash, Scots pine and Sitka spruce forests in Ireland to compare the mite assemblages in each and to determine the associations between forest type and the form of constituent microhabitats in determining the structure of this fauna. There were significant differences between the diversity and species composition of the assemblages in the different forest types with the largest species richness occurring in oak forest and the smallest in first rotation Sitka spruce forest. Analysis of our data, together with the results from other studies, suggest that the differences arise because the variation between the architecture of the tree species is reflected in the structure of microhabitats such as the form of the bark and the extent of moss cover. Thus while the ultimate factors affecting the variation in the mite fauna may be the form of the microhabitats, these are intrinsic properties of the forests associated directly with the species of tree. Finally, our results do not support the view that exotic species will necessarily have low biodiversity of mites than native forests.
