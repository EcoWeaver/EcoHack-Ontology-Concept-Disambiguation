Possibilities for Exploitation of Invasive Species, Arundo donax L., as a Source of Phenol Compounds
AbstractRecycling and reuse are a fundamental pillar for reducing global pollution. In this context, the use of waste generated by invasive species control actions, as a natural raw material for the exploitation of their bioactive compounds, provides a great interest for a more sustainable industry. In this study, phenolic compounds were determined from the different parts that compose the invasive species Arundo donax L. The experiments were carried out using response surface methodology (RSM) by the Box-Behnken method, allowing us to evaluate the factors (temperature, time and type of solvent) and the values that optimized the extraction. The highest concentration of total phenolic compounds equivalent in gallic acid (GAE) was obtained from extracts with distilled water, with the fraction of leaves (7.43 mg GAE /g) in first place, followed by inflorescences (5.15 mg GAE /g) and finally stems (2.73 mg GAE /g).These optimum values were obtained using conditions of 6 h and 45 degC for leaves and stems and 4 h and 35 degC for inflorescences.. Identification and quantification of phenolic acids and flavonoids were carried out by HPLC-MS/MS analytical technique. In general, stem extracts were the most abundant in phenolic acids with potential pharmacological properties. These studies provided promising results for the Arundo donax L. species as a source of polyphenols, making full use of its residue and aiming to boost the circular economy in important industry sectors.
