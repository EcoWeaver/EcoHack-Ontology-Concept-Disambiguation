Dikerogammarus villosus (Sowinsky, 1894) (Crustacea, Amphipoda) colonizes next alpine lake - Lac du Bourget, France
Dikerogammarus villosus has been recorded for the first time in the alpine lake - Lac du Bourget, French Alps. Low abundance of the alien species in gathered samples suggests that the colonization is just in its initial stage. Two native gammarid species: Gammarus fossarum (Koch, 1835) and G. pulex (Linnaeus, 1758) are still present in the lake. The invader has most probably reached the lake through the Canal de Savieres joining the lake to the Rhone River in which it has been already present since late 1990s.
