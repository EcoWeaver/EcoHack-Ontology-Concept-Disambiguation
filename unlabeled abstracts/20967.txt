The contribution of the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory to developing an understanding of long-term (1934-2008) changes in managed and unmanaged forests
Long-term records from USDA Forest Service Experimental Forests and Ranges (EF&Rs) are exceptionally valuable scientific resources and common ground for research in natural resource management. Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, Southern Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina, is one of 82 EF&Rs located throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Since its establishment in 1934, the wealth and breadth of scientific knowledge gained from Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory research has provided both public and private land managers information on forest land management and has added to the knowledge base of natural resource science.
