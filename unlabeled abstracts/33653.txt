Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are a double-edged sword in plant invasion controlled by phosphorus concentration
The invasion success of some exotic plants depends on associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which range along a continuum from strong mutualism to parasitism frequently affected by soil phosphorus (P) availability. It is unclear how P availability shifts AM associations on native and invasive plants, which in turn influence their competition. In this work, we conducted a three-factor common garden experiment, including manipulations of P availability, AM fungi occurrence and interspecific competition to evaluate how AM fungi influence competition between two pairs of invasive and native plants under different P availabilities. Our results showed that P enrichment reduced positive AM effects on the growth of both native and invasive plants. Competition had no effect on AM colonization on the invasive plants, but reduced AM colonization on the native plants, which led invasive plants to receive greater AM benefits under low-P treatment, but to be exposed to stronger AM detriments under high-P treatment compared to the native competitors. Therefore, the competitive advantage of invasive vs native plants was enhanced by AM fungi under low-P treatment, but weakened under high-P treatment. Our work highlights the necessity to incorporate the interaction between soil microbes and nutrient availability on plant invasion in future studies.
