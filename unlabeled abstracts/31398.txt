The U.S. Geological Survey's Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database: over thirty years of tracking introduced aquatic species in the United States (and counting)
The U.S. Geological Survey's Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Database has tracked introductions of freshwater aquatic organisms in the United States for the past four decades. A website provides access to occurrence reports, distribution maps, and fact sheets for more than 1,000 species. The site also includes an on-line reporting system and an alert system for new occurrences. We provide an historical overview of the database, a description of its current capabilities and functionality, and a basic characterization of the data contained within the database.
