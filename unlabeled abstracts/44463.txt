Fate of invasive weed Mikania micrantha Kunth using vermitechnology employing three monoculture of earthworm species
Vermicomposting (VC) process, an excellent technique to convert invasive weed biomass into benign fertilizer. Earthworm species, Eisenia fetida, Eudrilus eugeniae, and Perionyx ceylanensis, were used to create a 60-day cycle of vermicomposting (VC) process. Reactors were set up in triplicate namely; control (VC), using E. fetida (VEF), using E. eudrilus (VEE), and using P. ceylanensis (VPC). 5:4:1 ratio is used containing invasive weed M. micrantha, cow-dung (CD), and sawdust (SD). Earthworm species were used to know the best species that can survive, have a lower mortality rate, and provide healthy compost. Among all, E. fetida showed successful growth rate with less mortality rate. Highest Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) (3.08%), total phosphorus (TP) (13.24 g/kg) and Potassium (33.25 g/kg) was observed in reactor VEF. PXRD analysis revealed the amorphous structure of the compound after 60 days of vermicomposting.
