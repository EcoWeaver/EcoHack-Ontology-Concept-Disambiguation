Long-term monitoring of an invasion process: the case of an isolated small wetland on a Mediterranean Island, second stage: toward a complete restoration
In the present article, the results of the first-stage of monitoring, following restoration works on a small Mediterranean wetland (Lake Stagnone, Capraia Island, Tuscan Archipelago), are reported. The recent spread of Typha and Phragmites in the lake changed diversity and composition of the plant communities. Nine years after their first monitoring (2009), a rarefaction of hydrophytes and small helophytes of conservation interest was detected. In 2010, the restoration started with the aim to remove (or at least reduce) the populations of the large, expansive helophytes. In 2012, the first post-actions monitoring were carried out using the same methods as previously, analysing the plant presence/absence and their cover value recorded in the same 15 plots selected in 2000 and 2009. The rise and fall of the populations of the various flora and vegetation types during this invasion process and the following restoration were statistically analysed. One year following the restoration, some recovery (replacement) had occurred of autochthonous hydrophytes and small helophytes. Many of these species are of conservation interest. Some aquatic plants, present on the site until the more or less recent past, were once more recorded. Given the rapid recovery of populations of many autochthonous species, the results are reasonably encouraging, rendering planned reintroductions unnecessary at the moment. On the other hand, because of the short time elapsed since restoration, the current community structure cannot in any way be considered an "equilibrium" one. Continued and regular monitoring is required to allow the reestablishment of the large expansive helophytes populations.
