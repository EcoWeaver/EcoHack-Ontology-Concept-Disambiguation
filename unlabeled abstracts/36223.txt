Effects of landscape composition on the occurrence of a widespread invasive bird species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
Despite the growing concern and literature on biological invasions, few studies have adopted an explicit landscape perspective to understand occurrence patterns of invasive species. We investigated how landscape composition influences the occurrence of a widespread invasive bird species, the Monk Parakeet Myiopsitta monachus, across landscapes of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We determined occurrence patterns and habitat composition in 24 sites, half of which harboring established populations of the species. Landscape composition had clear effects on species occurrence. Probability of occurrence decreased as the amounts of anthropogenic and agricultural areas in the landscape increased. Landscape composition was mostly strongly related to occurrence patterns when measured at the largest spatial scale considered (search radius = 3 km). Our results show that landscape composition may affect occurrence patterns of invasive species across landscapes. They also suggest that invasive species are not necessarily favored by habitat disturbance at the landscape level.
