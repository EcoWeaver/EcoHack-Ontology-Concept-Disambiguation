Short pulse of 1080 improves the survival of brown kiwi chicks in an area subjected to long-term stoat trapping
Many mainland populations of kiwi are declining because stoats (Mustela erminea) kill most of their chicks. Stoats are often trapped during conservation programmes, but the long-term effectiveness of trapping has not been measured. During continuous trapping of mammalian predators in the 9800 ha Whangarei Kiwi Sanctuary, the survival of brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) chicks declined over time. Following the use of sodium fluoroacetate (1080) to kill rats (Rattus spp.) and possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and likely secondary poisoning of stoats, chick survival at Riponui increased from 5% to 56%, and the 62% chick survival at Rarewarewa was better than the 20% recorded in a trapped-only area nearby. We suggest that untrappable stoats accumulate in areas subjected to continuous predator trapping. Conservation managers should build into their long-term pest control programmes a periodic pulse of an alternative tool to kill pests that, for whatever reason, actively avoid the primary control tool.
