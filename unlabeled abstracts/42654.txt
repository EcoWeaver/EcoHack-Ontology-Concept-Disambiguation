The Influence of the Invasive Plant Taraxacum officinale (FH Wigg)  on Soil Characteristics
The study which was aimed at detecting the effects of the properties of Taraxacum officinale on the characteristics of the soils was carried out in a garden in Use Offot Community in Uyo, Akwa Ibom state using the purposive sampling method. The samples were collected at a depth of 0-30 cm from different points in the study area, and were bulked into one composite sample. Standard procedures were adopted in the analyses of the soil sample and the results of the analysis of the sample showed that the soil with Taraxacum officinale had a neutral soil pH (7.055) as against the control soil which had a slightly acidic pH (6.72). The organic carbon, total nitrogen and available phosphorus contents were 0.78 %, 0.04 %, and 87.04 mg/kg respectively. The average cation exchange capacity (3.25 cmol/kg) was low; also the soil texture of the samples were identified as loamy sand. These values revealed that Taraxacum officinale had effects on the physicochemical properties of the soil it grew on.
