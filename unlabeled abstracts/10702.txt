Factors in habitat partitioning in Pseudotropheus aurora (Pisces: Cichlidae), an introduced species to a species-rich community of Lake Malawi
The territorial behaviour of a small rock-dwelling cichlid, Pseudotropheus aurora, was studied at Thumbi Island West at the southern end of Lake Malawi. P. aurora is one of several species that have been introduced to an already diverse fish community. Many of the endemic and introduced species are highly territorial. The coexistence of an introduced territorial species within a speciesrich community of other territorial species is examined. Territories from which P. aurora individuals were removed were invariably re-occupied by conspecifics. Similarly, when all territories of a certain area were emptied of all territory owners of any existing species, the former P. aurora territories were re-occupied by conspecifics. The possible roles of site specificity, competitive exclusion and behaviourally transmitted traditions regarding territories are discussed.
