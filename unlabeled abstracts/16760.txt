Pathways of macroinvertebrate invasions in the Ob River basin (West Siberia)
Water bodies of West Siberia mainly belong to the Ob River basin, which is not connected to other basins by shipping canals. The relative isolation of the basin predetermined the major role of industrial fisheries and aquarium trade in alien invertebrate transfer into the basin reservoirs. About 60% of the alien species were introduced into water bodies of West Siberia through industrial fisheries, and about 40% through aquarium fisheries. This paper is the first attempt to supplement a list of alien aquatic invertebrates from the Ob River basin. The data on the spread of 21 known non-indigenous species of invertebrates in this area are available. It should be noted that 7 species were deliberately introduced to enhance food reserves for fish, 8 were released by aquarists, 5 were inadvertently released during fish and forage organism introduction, and 1 (a crayfish) was imported for human consumption. For species with a known establishment period, there was a prolonged lag time in cases of both intentional and inadvertent introduction. The high invasion rate in the relatively isolated water bodies of the Ob River basin is comparable to that in Europe; hence, establishment of control over fishery-induced movement of alien invertebrates is required.
