Effects of hydrology on the growth and physiology of an invasive exotic,Lygodium microphyllum(Old World climbing fern)
We conducted a glasshouse study to examine effects of hydrology on the growth and physiology of Lygodium microphyllum (Old World climbing fern), an invasive exotic that is rapidly colonising forested wetlands in Florida, USA. We assessed the fernOs growth and physiological responses to three hydrological treat-ments - flood, drought and field capacity. To further explore the physiology of the treatment responses of L. microphyllum, we also sprayed each plant with gibberellic acid, paclobutrazol (gibberellin inhibitor) or a water control solution (at a rate of 5 mL three times per week) using a 3 * 3 factorial design. Flooding reduced relative growth rate by 55%, whereas periodic exposure of ferns to a soil water potential of)1 MPa did not affect growth or physiology. Flooding led to substantial decreases in specific leaf area and area-based rates of pinna photosynthesis, resulting in a 64% lower rate of photosynthesis per unit pinna mass. Application of growth regulators had no effect on fern growth, morphology or physiology. Even though flooding sub-stantially reduced growth, L. microphyllum still showed a positive relative growth rate after >2 months of inundated soils. This apparent hydrological plasticity is likely a contributing factor to the introduced fernOs widespread establishment across a range of plant com-munities within the Florida Everglades ecosystem. Short-term manipulation of site hydrology does not appear to be an effective management option. Conse-quently, this has considerable implications for the Everglades, which is undergoing a 30-year system-wide hydrological restoration.
