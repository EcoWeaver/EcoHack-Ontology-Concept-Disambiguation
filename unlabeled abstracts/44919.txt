The Biotic Resistance of Soil Biota on the Invasive Weed Coreopsis grandiflora Varies with Irradiance Levels
A greenhouse experiment was carried out to study the effects of the sterilization of the soil on the invasive weed Coreopsis grandiflora Hogg. at two irradiance levels. The sterilization was done by benomyl which is a fungicide used worldwide to sterilize the fungal pathogens. The study found that the effects of the sterilization on C. grandiflora varied with the light intensity in terms of the leaf biomass, total biomass and the root-shoot ratio. At high irradiance (60%) the sterilization significantly increased the leaf biomass, total biomass and the ability of photosynthesis of C. grandiflora, suggesting there are soil pathogenic fungi which contribute to biotic resistance against the invasive plants. In contrast, at low irradiance, the sterilization did not have significant effects on the biomass of the plant although the Fv/Fm was significantly increased, suggesting that the light was the key factor and the biotic resistance of soil biota have some minor effects on the plant invasion of C. grandiflora in low light habitat such as forest canopy. The biotic resistance of soil biota on C. grandiflora varies with irradiance levels, suggesting the limiting factors of invasive plants are complex and vary with microhabitats.
