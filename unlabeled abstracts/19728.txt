Isolation and characterization of polymorphic microsatellite markers for the invasive Senecio inaequidens DC. (Asteraceae)
Senecio inaequidens is an invasive plant native from South Africa where it is part of a polyploid complex. We developed nine polymorphic microsatellite markers for tetraploid and diploid plants of the complex. The loci described have between 3 and 28 alleles. They were amplified in both diploid and tetraploid populations with the exception of two loci that were not amplified in one of the diploid population. These markers can be used to clarify relationships within the complex, phylogeography of the invasive plants and diversity in the invaded area.
