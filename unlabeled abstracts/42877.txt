Integrated Framework for the Simulation of Biological Invasions in a Heterogeneous Landscape
Abstract In the integrated framework presented in this article, a geographical information system serves as a shell to integrate spatial, dynamic and stochastic perspectives of biological invasions in a coherent workflow. A decision tree model stratifies the landscape with respect to spatial susceptibility and builds the spatial biophysical structure for the simulation of species invasion. A dynamic diffusion model evaluates the temporal changes of species to provide the dynamic parameters for the simulation. A simulation model derived from percolation theory simulates species invasion by combining spatial and dynamic information, and explicitly representing spatio-temporal patterns of invasions within the GIS-percolation environment. The simulation illustrates the great influence of spatial structure and connectivity of landscape on the diffusion of the species.
