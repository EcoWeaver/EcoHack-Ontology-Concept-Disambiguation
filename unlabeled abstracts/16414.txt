Relationships among maleColeophora deauratella(Lepidoptera: Coleophoridae) pheromone-baited trap capture, larval abundance, damage and flight phenology
The red clover casebearer Coleophora deauratella Leinig and Zeller is an invasive pest of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) grown for seed production in Canada. Drastic yield losses (80-99.5%) have been reported in several growing regions over the last 30 years as a result of larval feeding damage.Field trials conducted in red clover seed production fields in Alberta, Canada, during the summers of 2010-2012 tested the efficacy of pheromone-baited traps to predict population density and assess male flight phenology of C. deauratella.Male moth pheromone-trap capture was positively related to larval abundance and proportion seed damage at both moderate and high population densities.Phenological models based on degree days (DD11.7) were better at describing median (50%) male flight compared with ordinal date models. Median C. deauratella male flight occurs at 258.39 DD11.7, starting from 1 January each year in the Peace River region of Alberta.The results obtained in the present study demonstrate that pheromone-baited traps can be used to detect the spread of this invasive species. Future work could incorporate pheromone-based monitoring into assessment for the need and timing of control measures to target this invasive pest.
