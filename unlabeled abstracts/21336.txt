New detection of a 30-year-old population of introduced mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus on Kyushu Island, Japan
The small Indian mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, which was recently determined to be a separate species from the Javan mongoose H. javanicus, is one of the most notorious invasive predators known. A population of Herpestes sp. was recently reported at Kagoshima prefecture on Kyushu Island, one of the main Japanese islands. Surprisingly, the trapping actions and information from residents after this report suggest that this Herpestes sp. population has been established in this area for at least 30 years. In this study, based on mitochondrial DNA sequences, we identified seven recently obtained Herpestes sp. individuals from this area as H. auropunctatus, confirming that an additional mongoose population has been established on Kyushu Island. Confirmation of the spatial distribution of the mongoose and surveillance systems in surrounding areas are urgently needed to prevent further expansion of this mongoose's distribution. It also highlights the large gap between the accepted scientific knowledge relating to biosecurity against biological invasion and local knowledge on the ground, even when the introduced species is notorious and relatively conspicuous. Recent progressions of invasibility studies would greatly contribute to the prioritization of allocating adequate resources to areas with high invasion risks.
