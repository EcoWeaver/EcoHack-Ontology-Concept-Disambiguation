Comment on "Opposing Effects of Native and Exotic Herbivores on Plant Invasions"
Parker et al . (Reports, 10 March 2006, p. 1459) showed that native herbivores suppress exotic plants more than native plants. Further analysis reveals that the effect of native herbivores is reduced on exotic plant species that are closely related to native species in the invaded region. Exotic plants may share traits with native congeners that confer similar resistance to resident herbivores.
