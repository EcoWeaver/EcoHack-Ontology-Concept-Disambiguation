The influence of nitrogen, water and competition on the vegetative and reproductive growth of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.)
As common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) spreads across Europe and other regions, it is becoming both a health and an economic threat. To better understand which environmental conditions facilitate the spread of the invasive species, in 2010, a greenhouse experiment was conducted determining the effects of various nitrogen levels (10, 50 and 100 kg N/ha), soil moisture level (low and high) and competition levels (no competition, medium competition and high competition) on the growth parameters of ragweed. Single-grown ragweed responded favourably to the medium nitrogen and water increase, whereas the ragweed growth parameters in competition stands increased only when high levels of nitrogen and water were added. High competition reduced the total dry matter of ragweed by up to 83%, but the ragweed continued to increase its relative growth rate during the full-flowering stage and allocate its dry matter to reproductive parts, producing up to 70 seeds per plant. Ragweed is a poor competitor when there is high resource availability; however, under disturbance and in the shortage of nutrients and water conditions, the intensity of competition decreases and the ragweed performance is minimally affected. The addition of medium levels of nitrogen to promote the growth of competitive species, prevention of disturbance and establishment of plant communities with stress-tolerant species is measures that should help to prevent the further spread of ragweed.
