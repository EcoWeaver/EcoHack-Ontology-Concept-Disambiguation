The first sighting of Asian clams in Massachusetts was in a section of the Charles River in Watertown, MA. Currently there are 29 sites (representing 28 water bodies) reported to have the invasive Asian clam in Massachusetts. These recent infestations may reflect the warming temperature in this region because all clams were found in the warmer parts of the state where water temperature is above the clams' long-term incipient lower thermal limit.

The maximum shell length was 22.64 mm and most individuals were estimated to be about one year old.
