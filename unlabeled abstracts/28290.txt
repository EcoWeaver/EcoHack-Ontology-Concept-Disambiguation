Serpulid species (Polychaeta: Serpulidae) from the Levantine coast of Turkey (eastern Mediterranean), with special emphasis on alien species
The faunistic analysis of benthic samples taken from 0 to 200 m depths on the eastern Levantine coast of Turkey in September 2005 yielded the presence of 16 serpulid species, 9 of which are considered to be aliens: Hydroides brachyacanthus, H. diramphus, H. elegans, H. heterocerus, H. homoceros, H. minax, H. operculatus, Pomatoleios kraussii and Spirobranchus tetraceros. Ten species are new records for the Levantine coast of Turkey. Hydroides operculatus and P. kraussii formed dense populations on shallow-water artificial and natural hard substrates in the area. The population density and biomass (wet weight) of H. operculatus reached up to 384,000 individuals.m -2 and 245.76 g.m -2 in Mersin Bay and those of P. kraussii up to 52,000 -2 and 154.76 g.m -2 in Iskenderun Harbour. The species with the highest frequency values at shallow water stations (0-5 m) were P. kraussii (50%), Pomatoceros lamarckii (50%), H. minax (42%), H. brachyacanthus (38%) and H. elegans (29%). Alien species were not found at depths deeper than 25 m. Alien species accounted for more than 85% of the serpulid specimens collected. Brief descriptions of the species, and their distributional, reproductive and ecological characteristics are given. In addition, population characteristics of the dominant species, H. operculatus and P. kraussii, are analyzed.
