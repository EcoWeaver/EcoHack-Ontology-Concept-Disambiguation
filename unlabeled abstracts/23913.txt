Evaluation of Gambierdiscus survival after exposure to ballast water
The dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus was exposed to ballast water from a trans-oceanic vessel, and maintained at a variety of temperatures in the dark to determine if viability would be maintained. Logarithmically growing Gambierdiscus inocula were admixed (1:6, vol:vol) with ballast water, maintained in the dark at 22.6degC, 24.6degC, 26.8degC and 29.0degC and assessed for numerical abundance over six days. Calculated growth rates from the biomass time series showed no indication that ballast water negatively impacted Gambierdiscus viability; accompanying microscopic inspections supported this conclusion. Filtration of large volumes of collected ballast water failed to show the presence of any Gambierdiscus cells contained therein. Recovery and microscopic examination of the experimental inocula after 10 weeks in the dark, failed to show cyst development at any temperature regime. This examination of ballast water showed no evidence of cytotoxicity to Gambierdiscus spp.
