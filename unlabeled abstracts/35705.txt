Estimated economic impacts of seven invasive alien species in Chile
This findings abstract presents preliminary estimates of the economic impact of seven invasive alien species (IAS) in Chile on productive sectors of the economy and biodiversity. The study was required by decision-makers as part of the research of the project "Strengthening National Frameworks for Invasive Alien Species Governance" funded by GEF (Global Environmental Facility). The impacts of beaver (Castor canadensis), rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), American mink (Neovison vison), yellow jacket (Vespula germanica), blackberry (Rubus spp.), and ulex (Ulex europaeus) were assessed. Few impacts could be estimated given the lack of information in Chile. Considering the impacts assessed, Chile may lose at least USD 90 million per year due to these seven IAS. Without implementing control measures, in 20 years, Chile will lose at least approximately USD 2 billion from the impacts of these species on biodiversity and productive sectors.
