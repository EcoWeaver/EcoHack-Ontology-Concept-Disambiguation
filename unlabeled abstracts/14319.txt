Revision of the Arborescent Bauhinias (Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae: Cercideae) Native to Middle America
Twenty-seven arborescent species of Bauhinia native to Middle America, of which 20 species are endemic, are recognized in a systematic treatment. It is postulated that the high endemism is the result of introduction of a few ancestral species from South America, followed by rapid speciation in the new habitat. Bauhinia fryxellii sp. nov., endemic to San Luis Potosi, Mexico is described and illustrated and Bauhinia chapulhuacania nom. nov. (= B. dipetala var. macrophylla Wunderlin) is proposed. Keys, descriptions, distributional data, and taxonomic index are provided.
