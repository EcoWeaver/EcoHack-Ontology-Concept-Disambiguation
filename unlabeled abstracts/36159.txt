Variation in Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Contamination Between Native and Introduced Species of Fishes of Pallikaranai Wetland, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India
The impacts of invasive fish species on recipient communities are mostly considered a threat to the biodiversity of freshwater systems. A characteristic of introduced species turning invasive is their higher tolerance to environmental stressors. To understand if non-native fishes in Pallikaranai wetland, Tamil Nadu, India, are more tolerant to anthropogenic pressures in the Wetland, we assessed the variation in Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon contamination between introduced and native fish species. Mean levels of Naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, and total PAH in samples of introduced species were higher than native species, while High Molecular weight PAH and carcinogenic PAH4 were higher in native fish species. The data was also analysed to assess if co-variates (organs, seasons, and sex) affected PAH accumulation patterns in non-native species. It was observed that only organs, sex, and year contributed significantly.
