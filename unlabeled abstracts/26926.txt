Invasions of alien amphipods (Amphipoda: Gammaridea) in aquatic ecosystems of North-Western Russia: pathways and consequences
Since the middle of the 20th century, six species of Ponto-Caspian amphipods (Chaetogammarus ischnus, C. warpachowskyi, Chelicorophium curvispinum, Dikerogammarus haemobaphes, Obesogammarus crassus, Pontogammarus robustoides), one Baikalian amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus and one amphipod of Atlantic origin Gammarus tigrinus have expanded in Russia and adjacent regions. A wide variety of human mediated vectors such as deliberate and accidental introductions, natural migration via constructed inland waterways and high rates of spread, survival and reproduction in these species have facilitated rapid dispersal and successful establishment of these alien species. Causes of successful establishment of these invaders and potential consequences of the invasions including extinctions of native species in rivers, lakes and estuaries of north-western Russia are discussed.
