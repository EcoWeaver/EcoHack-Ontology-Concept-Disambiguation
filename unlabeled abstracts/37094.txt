First record of Hirsutella saussurei in the Galapagos Islands and first evidence parasitizing the invasive paper wasp, Polistes versicolor
In the present work we report the first occurrence of the entomogenous fungus Hirsutella saussurei, in the Galapagos Islands, and also the first evidence of this fungus parasitizing a new host: the invasive paper wasp Polistes versicolor. Some wasps parasitized by the fungus were found in Santa Cruz island in 2018 and 2019, while two new specimens were found in Floreana in 2019. Our data enlarge both the geographical distribution of the fungus and the host range. Even though P. versicolor is considered an important threat for the Galapagos endemic fauna, it is necessary a deep research to know if H. saussurei could be included under control programs of this invasive wasp.
