Environmental DNA as a detection tool for zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771) at the forefront of an invasion event in Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada
Zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771), an invasive bivalve in North America, was first recorded in Lake Winnipeg in 2013. Quagga mussel D. bugensis (Andrusov, 1897), a second invasive mussel to North America, has yet to be detected in Manitoba waters. The establishment and continued spread of zebra mussels is of concern. Accordingly, we developed two species-specific and one Dreissena-specific qPCR-based environmental DNA (eDNA) assays designed as a single multiplexed reaction able to identify the presence of zebra mussel and infer the presence of quagga mussel in water samples from at-risk and invaded locations. In 2014, samples were collected from four invaded harbours on Lake Winnipeg during the early (May) and late (October) seasons. Zebra mussel eDNA was detected in 0-33.3% of samples per site early in the season, whereas late season sample detection ranged from 42.9 to 100%. In order to confirm that there was no nonspecific amplification of DNA from local biota, samples were also collected from sites where neither adult nor veliger-stage zebra mussels had been previously observed. These sites included three harbours on Lake Winnipeg and six sites within the Manitoban portion of the Red River. No amplification of eDNA was recorded at these sites except for that at a float-plane dock in the Red River upstream of Lake Winnipeg. Zebra mussels were subsequently detected at this location by sampling for transformed attached individuals. Thus, we demonstrate that eDNA is an early indicator of the presence of zebra mussels and is a useful detection tool at the forefront of their recent invasion in Manitoba. This work provides the foundation for the development of a zebra mussel eDNA monitoring program for waterbodies in Manitoba and western Canada.
