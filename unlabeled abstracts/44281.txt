Invasive Plants and the Green Industry
There are many motivations for introducing plant species to areas outside their native range. Non-native plants can provide food, medicine, shelter, and ecosystem services, as well as aesthetic value. However, some species, such as Norway maple (Acer platanoides), Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii), and Oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus), have escaped from cultivation, with severe ecological and economic consequences. The approval of a National Invasive Species Management Plan in June 2001 has major implications for future plant introductions and has generated concern in the green industry. There is general agreement among plant professionals regarding (1) a need for education of industry people and client groups on the issue of invasive species, (2) minimizing economic disruption to the nursery industry, and (3) requirements for objective data to support listing of species as invasive. Nursery and landscape associations in several states have already taken steps toward listing invasive species in cooperation with conservation organizations. This proactive approach ensures industry representation and input in developing policy and, when coupled with intense and ongoing educational programs for industry people and their clients, could dramatically reduce the introduction and spread of invasive species.
