Closing the circle in the Mediterranean Sea: Bursatella leachii Blainville, 1817 (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Anaspidea) has reached Morocco
The ragged sea hare Bursatella leachii Blainville, 1817 is a circumtropical mollusc species widely distributed both in the Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific, including the Red Sea. Since the mid-20th century, it has been moving east to west in the Mediterranean Sea. The present work reviews the spread of B. leachii in the Mediterranean Basin and provides the first record in the Mediterranean Morocco (Marchica coastal lagoon), the 19th country colonized by this taxon out of 23 with Mediterranean Sea coastlines. This study also constitutes the first record from the southern Alboran Sea and represents the westernmost record of the species in the Mediterranean. Although the Red Sea is thought to be the most likely origin (Lessepsian migration) of the Mediterranean populations, phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies would be desirable to assess with certainties both the taxonomy and the proper origin of the species not only in the western part of the basin, but also in the Mediterranean Sea as a whole.
