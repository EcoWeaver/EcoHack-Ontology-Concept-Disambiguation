Node-by-node disassembly of a mutualistic interaction web driven by species introductions
Significance Examining the effects of species gains and losses is fundamental to understanding the assembly and disassembly of ecological communities in a changing world. However, field-based empirical studies that demonstrate the disassembly of mutualistic webs are exceedingly rare. In this study, we take advantage of an ongoing natural experiment that links the gain of invasive species (introduced large mammals and wasps), the loss of a native keystone species (a mistletoe), and the ensuing node-by-node disassembly of an interaction web in Patagonia, Argentina. Our results demonstrate that the gains and losses of species are both consequences and drivers of global change that can lead to underappreciated cascading coextinctions through the disruption of mutualisms.
