The Suez Canal as a revolving door for marine species: a reply to Galil et al. (2016)
In this reply, we address the criticism directed recently to our work (Malaquias et al. 2016) by Galil et al. (2016) dismissing the hypothesis that the Suez Canal can act as a revolving door allowing marine species to move both ways between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. We reiterate that the presence in the Red Sea of the Indo-West Pacific sea slug Chelidonura fulvipunctata Baba, 1938 is most parsimoniously explained by an invasion from the Mediterranean and highlight several recent studies combing morphology and molecular phylogenetics where established views about the presence of alien Indo-Pacific / Red Sea species in the Mediterranean were proven wrong. Caution is suggested when assuming the conspecificity of species between these realms based solely on external features.
