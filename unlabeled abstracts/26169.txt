Growth of the razor clam Ensis directus, an alien species in the Wash on the east coast of England
Samples of shells of the razor clam Ensis directus were examined in order to characterize annually forming shell marks (annuli). Shells from different grounds were aged by naked-eye examination. Back measurements at the identified annuli were used to generate length at age data, to which von Bertalanffy growth parameters were fitted.
