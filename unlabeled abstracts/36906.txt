Using stable isotopes to analyse extinction risks and reintroduction opportunities of native species in invaded ecosystems
AbstractInvasive non-native species have pervasive impacts on native biodiversity, including population extirpations and species extinctions. Identifying reasons why a population of a native species is extirpated following an invasion often relies on literature-based results of anecdotal observations. The well-established schemes of existing risk assessments for invasive species assume that a species' information (e.g. impacts or behavioural and biological traits) can be projected from one area to another to estimate the potential impact of a species in another environment. We used stable isotope data (d13C, d15N) from both invaded and uninvaded communities to predict such invasion impacts by reconstructing trophic relationships. This approach was tested on a community within a protected lake in Northern Spain where, following the introductions of non-native species, the last resident native species (the common tench Tinca tinca, the European eel Anguilla anguilla, and the whirligig beetle Gyrinus sp.) had been extirpated. Through the application of this novel approach, we found evidence that native species' declines were related to direct predation by and resource overlap with non-native species, which occurred in conjunction with habitat modification. Using this approach, we outlined the mechanisms involved in the extirpation of native species in the post-invasion period. To compensate for losses of native species induced by invasions of non-native species, native species reintroductions might be an appropriate tool. For this, we further suggested and discussed a novel approach that predicts the outcome of arising interactions by superimposing stable isotope data from alternative sources to better estimate the success of native species' reintroductions.
