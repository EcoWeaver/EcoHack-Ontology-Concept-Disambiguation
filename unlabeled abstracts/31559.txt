A pair of native fungal pathogens drives decline of a new invasive herbivore
Two North American fungal pathogens caused a coepizootic leading to localized collapse of an outbreak population of the newly invasive planthopper pest, the spotted lanternfly ( Lycorma delicatula ), in the eastern United States. The pathogens partitioned the habitat, with the majority of L. delicatula on tree trunks killed by Batkoa major , while cadavers of L. delicatula killed by Beauveria bassiana were usually on the ground. The future will show whether these pathogens will be drivers in boom-bust cycles or will result in recurrent low population densities of this new invasive species.
