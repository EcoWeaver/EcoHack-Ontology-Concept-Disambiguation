The influence of environmental conditions and hydrologic connectivity on cyanobacteria assemblages in two drowned river mouth lakes
We evaluated the temporal and spatial variability of cyanotoxins, water chemistry, and cyanobacteria communities in two lakes of different trophic status. Bear Lake is a hypereutrophic system that flows into mesotrophic Muskegon Lake. Total microcystins (MC) in Bear Lake (mean, 1.66mg/L) were composed of multiple structural analogs: 43% MC-LR, 50% MC-RR, and 7% MC-YR. Total microcystins in Muskegon Lake (mean, 0.52mg/L) consisted of MC-LR (76%), MC-RR (14%), MC-YR (6%), and MC-LA (3%). The lakes were dominated by the cyanobacteria Microcystis spp., which accounted for 75% of phytoplankton biovolume in Bear Lake and >90% in Muskegon Lake. Total microcystin concentration was positively correlated with cyanobacteria biovolume and turbidity (Muskegon Lake) and total phosphorus (Bear Lake), while negatively correlated with ammonia (Bear Lake) and nitrate (both lakes). The relationships between microcystins and environmental factors differed between lakes, despite hydrologic connectivity, suggesting that local conditions have a greater influence on toxin production than regional effects. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was found in both systems; however, the assemblage does not appear to be capable of producing cylindrospermopsin due to the absence of the PKS gene. Although the Bear Lake discharge appears to be the source of C. raciborskii, the physical/chemical properties of Muskegon Lake (lower turbidity and temperature, higher nitrate) may constrain the growth of this invasive species. Thus, local conditions in each lake are important in determining which species are capable of maintaining a viable population.
