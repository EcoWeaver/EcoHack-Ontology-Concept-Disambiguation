No impact of a native beetle on exotic plant performance and competitive ability due to plant compensation
The novel associations between invasive plants and their natural enemies in the introduced range have recently received increasing attention; however, the effects of novel enemies on exotic plant performance and competition with native species remain poorly explored. Here, we tested the impact of herbivory by a native beetle, Cassida piperata, on the performance of the exotic species Alternanthera philoxeroides and competition with a native congener, Alternanthera sessilis, using common garden experiments in central China. We found A. philoxeroides was able to fully compensate for intense herbivory by C. piperata. Herbivory by C. piperata that released at the average density in this region had no impact on competition between the native and exotic plant species. Our results indicate that herbivory by novel enemies may not reduce exotic plant performance due to plant compensation. However, high tolerance to herbivory may not confer a competitive advantage for exotic species compared to less tolerant native competitors if the herbivore damage is below a certain threshold. Thus, it is necessary to assess the impact of novel enemies on exotic plant performance and competition with native plants along gradients of insect densities. This may lead to a better understanding of how best to exploit the role of native herbivores in facilitating or slowing plant invasions.
