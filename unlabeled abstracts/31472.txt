Plant invasions in undisturbed ecosystems: The triggering attribute approach
The invasion of a target community by a non-indigenous plant species includes the stages of arrival, establishment and spread, which tend to depend on different characteristics of the invasive species and its context. While the mechanisms be-hind the invasion of highly disturbed ecosystems are well known, our understanding of the invasion process in undis-turbed or weakly disturbed ecosystems is much more limited. Here we propose that, once a non-indigenous species has arrived to a new ecosystem and become established, the like-lihood that it spreads, and thus becomes invasive, may depend on just one or very few characteristics, called 'triggering attributes' (TA), We propose that a TA is a vegetative or regenerative attribute discontinuously distributed in compari-son to the resident community, This attribute allows the species to benefit from a resource that is permanently or temporarily unused by the resident community. We present an original study case and examples from the literature to illustrate our approach, and we also propose some ways to test it in different ecosystems.
