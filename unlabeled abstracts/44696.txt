Techniques to control woody invasive plants in Indiana hardwood forests
At Purdue University we are investigating ways to control invasive woody species growing in oak (Quercus L. [Fagaceae]) forests and other natural areas of Indiana. We have found several herbicides, and combinations of herbicides, that provide excellent control for a variety of woody invasive plant species when applied before, after, or in combination with mechanical removal. These control techniques offer a range of control options that are designed to be included in land managers' integrated vegetation management (IVM) plans. Vegetation management that integrates the control and replacement of invasive plants with the establishment of favorable vegetation can help managers to efficiently achieve habitat management objectives and avoid future invasive plant problems. Natural resource managers may find these suggestions and experiences useful when developing their own IVM plans.
