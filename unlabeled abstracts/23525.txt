Use of GIS to Prioritize Cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica) Control on Camp Shelby Joint Forces Training Center, Mississippi
Geographic information systems (GIS) analysis considering size and spatial distribution of infestations of invasive species on a landbase can assist with developing appropriate control strategies for that species. We used GIS to evaluate strategies that placed highest priority on: smallest patches of cogongrass, largest patches of cogongrass, and cogongrass patches on land considered high-value under military training and conservation priorities on Camp Shelby Joint Forces Training Center (CSJFTC), MS. Strategies were first evaluated using predicted increase in area of new growth prevented, if prioritized patches were treated with herbicide. Travel and other time needed to implement strategies were then assessed as they affected total area treated. Assuming equivalent areas treated, predicted total reduction in area was consistently highest for the strategy prioritizing smallest patches and lowest for the strategy prioritizing largest patches. However, travel and other time was sufficiently reduced for the strategy prioritizing patches on high-value land compared to the other strategies to suggest that this strategy would result in the greatest reduction in area infested with cogongrass. Analyses of spatial distribution and size of infestations can assist land managers with selecting the appropriate strategy for controlling invasive species. Nomenclature: Cogongrass, Imperata cylindrica (L.) Beauv.
