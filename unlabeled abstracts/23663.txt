Efficacy of prescribed grazing depends on timing intensity and frequency
1. Exotic weeds and woody plants have invaded many grasslands, and prescribed grazing is one management technique used to combat these plants. Prescribed grazing entails introducing livestock such as sheep or goats that eat unwanted plants. It sometimes has desirable effects, but inconsistencies among study results discourage widespread use. Detailed studies that manipulate grazing timings, intensities and frequencies may explain inconsistencies among previous studies and identify effective weed control strategies.
