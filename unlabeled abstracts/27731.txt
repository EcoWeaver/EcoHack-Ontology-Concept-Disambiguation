Quantifying geographic variation in physiological performance to address the absence of invading species
An estuarine snail (Batillaria attramentaria), introduced to northern California marshes, is displacing a native confamilial mudsnail (Cerithidea californica) through superior competition for shared, limiting food resources. Batillaria, however, is absent from similar marsh habitats in southern California. I tested whether regional-scale variation inrelative performance ,(growth) of the ,snails may ,have influenced Batillaria's invasion pattern. I quantified growth using RNA:DNA ratios (a growth ,index that I ground-truthed with ,direct growth ,measurements) ,for snails collected throughout their entire collective North American distribution. Batillaria exhibited a high ,growth rate that was more
