Heavy metal concentrations inCipangopaludina chinensis(Reeve, 1863) and relationships with sediments in Saint-Augustin Lake, Quebec City (Qc, Canada)
Saint-Augustin Lake is an urban lake in Quebec, Canada that has been subjected to long periods of direct human impact, mainly due to agricultural and urban activities, with great changes in trophic status and chemistry occurring within the last few decades. In 2009, during an examination of the lake bottom substrate, the presence of the invasive species Cipangopaludina chinensis (Reeve, 1863) was found on floor bottom sediments. The gastropods soft tissues were mineralized and analyzed by ICP-OES. The purpose of this study was to estimate concentrations of heavy metals in C. chinensis, describing the relations of these values with the sediment metal. In gastropod soft tissues the overall common trend in the heavy metal concentrations was revealed in the following order: Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > As > Ni > Pb > Cd > Cr. Biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) have shown that C. chinensis cannot be used as a bioindicator of heavy metal pollution and exposure in the Canadian lakes where it is present. In fact, while the sediments of Saint-Augustin Lake are characterized by high metal concentrations, C. chinensis does not have high bioaccumulation factors (BSAFs < 1.0). By literature comparison with other aquatic organisms in polluted ecosystems at different latitudes it was possible to affirm that the concentrations of Fe, Mn and Zn in C. chinensis tissues are considerable if compared with these sites.
