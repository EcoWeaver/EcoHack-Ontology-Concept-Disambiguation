Natal origin of the invasive biosecurity pest, brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys: Penatomidae), determined by dual-element stable isotope-ratio mass spectrometry
Background: Post-border detection of a single brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB) in New Zealand warranted a biosecurity response, the nature of which would be influenced by its status as part of an established population or as a new arrival. Stable isotope analysis has the potential to determine natal origins, but is difficult to achieve for samples as small as a single insect. Here an analytical modification to measure small samples was successfully trialled as a means to supply evidence as to the local or exotic natal origin of the intercepted BMSB specimen. Results: Sufficient analytical sensitivity was achieved using a modified isotope ratio mass spectrometry method, involving thermolysis and carbon monoxide cryofocussing, to enable the simultaneous analysis of d2 H and d18 O from wings of the post-border BMSB sample. The values were much lower than those of the New Zealand green vegetable bug, used as a local reference. However, they fell within the range of those for BMSB of Northern Hemisphere origin intercepted at the New Zealand border over the same time period; specifically overlapping with the USA and Italy, but not China. Conclusion: The isotope signature of the post-border detected BMSB suggested a significantly cooler climate than the North Island of New Zealand, indicating that it was a new arrival and did not represent an established population.
