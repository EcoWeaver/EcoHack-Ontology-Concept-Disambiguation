Development and characterization of microsatellite markers for the invasive weed Mikania micrantha (Asteraceae).
Mikania micrantha is a successful invasive weed in many parts of the world. Twelve polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized from an AC-enriched genomic library of this species. Twenty-eight individuals from one population in Dongguan were tested for polymorphism. The average allele number of these microsatellites was three per locus, ranging from two to five. The expected and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0.275 to 0.742, and from 0.250 to 1.000, respectively. These microsatellite markers can be applied to study the population genetics in the native and invasive ranges of this species, and to trace its invasion history.
