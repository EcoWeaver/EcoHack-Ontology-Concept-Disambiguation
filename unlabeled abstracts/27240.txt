Comprehensive review of the records of the biota of the Indian Seas and introduction of non-indigenous species
1.Comparison of the pre-1960 faunal survey data for the Indian Seas with that for the post-1960 period showed that 205 non-indigenous taxa were introduced in the post-1960 period; shipping activity is considered a plausible major vector for many of these introductions.2.Of the non-indigenous taxa, 21% were fish, followed by Polychaeta (<11%), Algae (10%), Crustacea (10%), Mollusca (10%), Ciliata (8%), Fungi (7%), Ascidians (6%) and minor invertebrates (17%).3.An analysis of the data suggests a correspondence between the shipping routes between India and various regions. There were 75 species common to the Indian Seas and the coastal seas of China and Japan, 63 to the Indo-Malaysian region, 42 to the Mediterranean, 40 and 34 to western and eastern Atlantic respectively, and 41 to Australia and New Zealand. A further 33 species were common to the Caribbean region, 32 to the eastern Pacific, 14 and 24 to the west and east coasts of Africa respectively, 18 to the Baltic, 15 to the middle Arabian Gulf and Red Sea, and 10 to the Brazilian coast.4.The Indo-Malaysian region can be identified as a centre of xenodiversity for biota from Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Philippines and Australian regions.5.Of the introduced species, the bivalve Mytilopsis sallei and the serpulid Ficopomatus enigmaticus have become pests in the Indian Seas, consistent with the Williamson and Fitter 'tens rule'. Included amongst the biota with economic impact are nine fouling and six wood-destroying organisms.6.Novel occurrences of the human pathogenic vibrios, e.g. Vibrio parahaemolyticus, non-01 Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio mimicus and the harmful algal bloom species Alexandrium spp. and Gymnodinium nagasakiense in the Indian coastal waters could be attributed to ballast water introductions.7.Introductions of alien biota could pose a threat to the highly productive tropical coastal waters, estuaries and mariculture sites and could cause economic impacts and ecological surprises.8.In addition to strict enforcement of a national quarantine policy on ballast water discharges, long-term multidisciplinary research on ballast water invaders is crucial to enhance our understanding of the biodiversity and functioning of the ecosystem.
