Effects of conspecifics on settling juveniles of the invasive golden mussel, Limnoperna fortunei
We conducted a field experiment to assess the influence of conspecific adults on recruitment success of the golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei. Tiles, 225cm2 surface area, were used as artificial substrates in four treatments: control (blank tiles), low (800musselsm-2), medium (4,000musselsm-2) and high (12,000musselsm-2) density treatments. Results indicated that recruitment was strongly affected by the presence and density of conspecifics. After one and 3months of exposure, numbers of recruits were significantly higher on tiles with conspecific adults than on blank tiles, and there was a positive and significant relationship between the number of recruits and the number of adults in the three treatments assayed. Also, after 3months of exposure, recruits in all treatments with adults present were larger than recruits in the control treatment. Our results suggest that conspecific adults have a positive effect on recruitment success and growth of newly settled juveniles through factors that enhance larval settling or that contribute to the survival of settlers in areas colonized by adult conspecifics.
