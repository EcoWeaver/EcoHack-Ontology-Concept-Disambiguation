Colonization, ALP activity and plant growth promotion of native and exotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi at low pH
Soil acidity can affect arbuscular mucorrhizal fungi (AMF) in many aspects. In this study, by inoculating white clover (Trifolium ripens L.) with AMF at two pH levels (pH 5.0 and 6.0), we investigated the influences of low pH on the colonization, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and promoting effect of AMF, and also compared the different responses of native AMF community and exotic species (Gigaspora margarita) to low pH. PCR-DGGE profiles revealed the obvious difference in native AMF community structure between low and high pH. Compared to low pH, high pH decreased the total and vesicle colonization, external hyphae length density of native AMF, but exerted no effect on those of exotic AMF. For both native and exotic AMF, high pH enhanced the proportions of arbuscule and fungal structure with ALP activity in colonized roots. Both native and exotic AMF promoted the shoot biomass, with greater increase at low pH than at high pH. Plant growth was more dependent on exotic AMF than on native AMF at both pH levels. The same trends were observed in P uptake as in biomass. Our study suggested that the increase in pH can exert inhibitory effects on AMF species native to acidic soil, including ecological (community structure), functional (ALP activity) and developmental (hyphal length, vesicle and arbuscule percentage, total colonization) aspects, but have no effect on exotic species in the present experiment.
