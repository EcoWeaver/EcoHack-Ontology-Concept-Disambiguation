Role of Anthropochory in the Invasion of Coral Cays by Alien Flora
As a consequence of human visitor traffic in the S Great Barrier Reef region there was a substantial invasion by an alien flora comprising mainly annual and perennial agrestal weeds found commonly on the adjacent mainland. The native regional flora comprised mainly perennial and woody species. anemochorous and epizoochorous species were most prevalent in the alien flora; the native flora comprised mainly endozoochorous and hydrochorous species. Life mode was conditional on photosynthetic pathway and implied a tendency of the annual and perennial species to use the C4 pathway, ie to have the physiological capacity to colonize light-saturated and moisture stressed habiats characteristic of the cay periphery. The percentage of alien plant species recorded on a cay is a sensitive nonlinear response to the frequency of human visitor traffic to that cay and, most importantly, is independent of cay size. Moreover, the proportion of alien species on the cays has increased consistently since 1912, consonant presumably with increasing frequency of traffic to the cays. There was no substantial evidence that alien species invasion of these cays was a consequence of anthropogenic habitat disturbance and subsequent diaspore dispersal by inanimate agents, nor that the native floras was being displaced by the alien flora.-from Authors
