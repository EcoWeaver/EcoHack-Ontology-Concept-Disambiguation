Plant functional traits best explain invasive species' performance within a dynamic ecosystem - A review
Invasive alien species (IAS) poses a significant threat to plant biodiversity globally and even considered one of the largest threats to biodiversity, second to habitat loss. They behave as pioneer species in different landscapes, tolerant to disturbances, climatic conditions, high competitive potential and generalists in distribution. Their superior competitive ability results in the loss of native flora leading to extinction. The success of IAS generally attributed to differences in functional traits compared to less successful aliens as well as to native species. Several studies envisaged that the impacts of plant invasions are not universal and depend on the trait diversity of both, the introduced species and the resident community. Functional traits best describe the alien's success over natives , and they seem to be important attributes to conservation biology and ecosystem management. Moreover, their ecological impacts remain poorly understood due to lack of quantitative studies. In the present paper, we adopted the systematic literature review approach for collecting and analysing the scientific data. A total of 212 critical research papers and grey literature for last three decades were found meeting the aims, were collected from relevant sources. Present review emphasizes the differences in key functional traits between invasive alien plants and the native species which aid them to alter ecosystem functioning by modifying habitat according to their needs. We also focus on potential habitats for invasion based on a conceptual framework concerning response-effect traits. Review provides a quantitative assessment of invading species for their ecological performance , emerging problems and possible solution.
