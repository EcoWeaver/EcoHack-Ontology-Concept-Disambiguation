Biodiversidad de los anfipodos bentonicos (Peracarida: Amphipoda) asociados a macroalgas de Puerto Progreso, Yucatan, Mexico
Biodiversity, new species records, geographic distribution range extensions, and invasive species of benthic amphipods from Puerto Progreso, Yucatan, Mexico, were analyzed. A total of 39 species, belonging to 21 genus, 16 families, and 2 suborders Gammaridea and Corophiidea, were identified. The species Caprella equilibra Say, 1818, Dulichiella lecroyae Lowry and Springthorpe, 2007, Laticorophium baconi (Shoemaker, 1934), Lembos websteri Bate, 1857, Leucothoe ashleyae Thomas and Klebba, 2006, Leucothoe barana Thomas and Klebba, 2007, Leucothoe garifunae Thomas and Klebba, 2007, and Nasageneia yucatanensis Ledoyer, 1986, represented extensions of the previously reported geographic distribution into the southern Gulf of Mexico; also, the species Bemlos barnardi (Ortiz and Nazabal, 1988) represents a new record for the the gulf. Ampelisca schellenbergi, Ampithoe longimana and Monocorophium acherusicum were recognized as invasive species, and Ampithoe ramondi, Ericthonius brasiliensis, Plesiolembos rectangulatus and Stenothoe gallensis as potentially invasive species in this study. These results updated the checklist of benthic amphipods from the offshore Yucatan state continental shelf up to 62 species, whilst that from southern Gulf of Mexico increases to 94.
