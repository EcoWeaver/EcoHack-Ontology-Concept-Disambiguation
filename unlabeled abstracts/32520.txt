Evidence for co-invasion events: different chigger species (Actinotrichida, Trombidioidea: trombiculidae) share a host
Cases of co-invasion of various chigger species parasitizing murids and cricetids in various habitats were analysed using morphological and molecular approaches. Here we provide evidence for 25 new cases of co-parasitism of chigger mites on rodent hosts (Myodes glareolus, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus agrarius) accounting for 8.6% of all host-parasite associations observed in this study. The results confirm higher incidence of co-parasitism in vertebrate-associated Parasitengona mites compared to arthropod-associated ones. Among factors influencing the occurrence of co-parasitism in Trombiculidae the body constitution and year-round availability of hosts associated with lower host specificity of larvae should be considered.
