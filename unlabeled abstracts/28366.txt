"Kill Two Birds with One Stone": Urban Tree Species Classification Using Bi-Temporal Pleiades Images to Study Nesting Preferences of an Invasive Bird
This study presents the results of object-based classifications assessing the potential of bi-temporal Pleiades images for mapping broadleaf and coniferous tree species potentially used by the ring-necked parakeet Psittacula krameri for nesting in the urban area of Marseille, France. The first classification was performed based solely on a summer Pleiades image (acquired on 28 July 2015) and the second classification based on bi-temporal Pleiades images (a spring image acquired on 24 March 2016 and the summer image). An ensemble of spectral and textural features was extracted from both images and two machine-learning classifiers were used, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Regardless of the classifiers, model results suggest that classification based on bi-temporal Pleiades images produces more satisfying results, with an overall accuracy 11.5-13.9% higher than classification using the single-date image. Textural and spectral features extracted from the blue and the NIR bands were consistently ranked among the most important features. Regardless of the classification scheme, RF slightly outperforms SVM. RF classification using bi-temporal Pleiades images allows identifying 98.5% of the tree species used by the ring-necked parakeet for nesting, highlighting the promising value of remote sensing techniques to assess the ecological requirements of fauna in urban areas.
