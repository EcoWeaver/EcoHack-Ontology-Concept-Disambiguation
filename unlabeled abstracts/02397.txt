Potential impact of genome exclusion by alien species in the hybridogenetic water frogs (Pelophylax esculentus complex)
Globalization and increasing human impact on natural aquatic systems have facilitated the movement of species and the establishment of nonindigenous species enhancing hybridisation opportunities between naturally allopatric species. In this review, we focus on a special case of natural hybrid speciation and the consequences of recent anthropogenic hybridisation in the water frog complex (Pelophylax esculentus complex), which consists of two parental species, Pelophylax lessonae and Pelophylax ridibundus and a hybrid taxon. The hybrid water frogs reproduce hybridogenetically and eliminate the genome of the syntopic water frog species. Although the actual cause triggering chromosome exclusion remains elusive, it has been proposed that chromosome elimination takes place prior to meiosis and may involve enzymatic degradation of the discarded genome. Translocations of water frogs in Western Europe have become frequent the last decade leading to rapid expansion of the range of the marsh frog P. ridibundus. Subsequent hybridisation of the exotic P. ridibundus may dramatically affect the viability and maintenance of hybrid water frog populations throughout Europe. Interestingly, the impact of this introduced species may differ depending on their geographic origin, which defines the ability to induce genome elimination. This may result in fertile or sterile hybrids, making global conservation guidelines challenging. We predict a severe genetic and ecological impact of nonindigenous P. ridibundus prompting for strict conservation measures to reduce species translocations and for studies on the geographic origin of exotic frog species.
