First report of Harmonia axyridis Pallas being attacked by Dinocampus coccinellae Schrank in Canada
Field parasitism of two lady beetles, a recently introduced species, Harmonia axyridis Pallas, and an indigenous species, Coleomegilla maculata lengi Timberlake, by Dinocampus coccinellae Schrank (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was investigated in southwestern Quebec. Adult coccinellids were sampled from June to September 2001 in alfalfa and corn fields. Parasitism rates were recorded by dissection and rearing of coccinellids in controlled condition. The average proportions of coccinellids with a parasitoid larva were 4.6%for H. axyridis and 32%for C. maculata but 0%of the H. axyridis and 5.9%of theC. maculatawere successfully parasitized. In July, more C. maculata than H. axyridiswere found to be parasitized and among all individuals dissected, C. maculata were more frequently found superparasitized than H. axyridis. Our results suggest that D. coccinellae is not well adapted to H. axyridis in Quebec. This is the first mention of H. axyridis being attacked by D. coccinellae in Canada.
