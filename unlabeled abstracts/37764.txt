ANALYSIS OF SPECIES COMPOSITION, PROBLEMS OF IDENTIFICATION AND DISPERSAL PATHWAYS OF INVASIVE SPECIES OF FISH IN VOLGA RIVER BASIN
The article describes the intensive economic activity in the second half of the 20th century, which, along with apparent global climatic changes in recent decades, led to an increase in the number of alien fish species in the water bodies of the Volga basin. There has been presented the data on the occurrence of invasive species in scientific catches in the Volga River reser-voirs, as well as in its unregulated areas and delta. The invaders' share in the fish species composition varied from 8 to 32%, depending on the geography of sampling. Special attention is paid to the reasons and pathways of invasive species' dispersal, as well as to changes in the genetic structure of their populations taking place during acclimatization to the new conditions. It has been proposed to utilize a combined genetic-morphological approach in order to enhance the species identification of found invaders. Collected material can be used in the development of control methods, as well as for suppressing the abundance of dangerous or undesirable invasive species
