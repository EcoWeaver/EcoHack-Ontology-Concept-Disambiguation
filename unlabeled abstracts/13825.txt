An environmental DNA assay for detecting Arctic grayling in the upper Missouri River basin, North America
The upper Missouri River basin in the northwestern US contains disjunct Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) populations of conservation concern. To assist efforts aimed at understanding Artic grayling distribution, we developed a quantitative PCR assay to detect the presence of Arctic grayling DNA in environmental samples. The assay amplified low concentrations of Arctic grayling DNA consistently, and did not amplify non-target species, including sympatric salmonid fishes.
