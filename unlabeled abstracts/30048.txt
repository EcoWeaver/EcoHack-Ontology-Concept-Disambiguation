The Biology of Invasive Alien Plants in Canada. 2. Cynanchum rossicum (Kleopow) Borhidi [= Vincetoxicum rossicum (Kleopow) Barbar.] and Cynanchum louiseae (L.) Kartesz & Gandhi [= Vincetoxicum nigrum (L.) Moench]
Cynanchum rossicum (dog-strangling vine) and C. louiseae (black dog-strangling vine) are introduced, perennial herbs or small twining vines in the Milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae). Generic placement of these two species has been problematic, but are here treated as members of Cynanchum subgenus Vincetoxicum. The species occur primarily in natural upland areas, including understories of woodlands, pastures, old fields, shores, flood plains and ruderal areas of southern Ontario and Quebec and the northeastern United States. Ecosystems on well-drained, stony soils are often densely colonized, but both species can tolerate a wide moisture regime. Plants establish in full sun or under forest canopies and may form monospecific stands in all light conditions. They often form dense colonies which smother other vegetation and reduce invertebrate and vertebrate biodiversity. Reproduction is by polyembryonic, wind-dispersed seeds. Effective control is primarily by herbicides, since mechanical control is difficult and no biological control agents have been developed. A third European species, C. vincetoxicum, has been reported as an occasional garden escape in southern Ontario and the northeastern United States, but has not yet become naturalized. Information on this species is included because of its close relationship with C. rossicum and its better known biology.
