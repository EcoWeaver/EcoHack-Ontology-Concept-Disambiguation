Biology of Leipothrix dipsacivagus (Acari: Eriophyidae), a candidate for biological control of invasive teasels (Dipsacus spp.).
The present study describes key aspects of the biology of Leipothrix dipsacivagus, an eriophyid mite that is under study as a biological control candidate of Dipsacus fullonum and D. laciniatus (Dipsacaceae). Preliminary host-specificity tests have shown that it can develop and reproduce only on Dipsacus spp. (teasels). Studies were conducted in a laboratory at 26 +- 2(o)C with 16 h of light per day. Mites for the stock colony were collected from D. laciniatus in Klokotnitsa, Bulgaria and reared on rosettes of D. laciniatus in the laboratory. Unfertilized L. dipsacivagus females reared in isolation from the juvenile stage produced male offspring only, while progeny of fertilized females were of both sexes, suggesting arrhenotokous parthenogenesis with haplodiploid sex determination. Experiments were designed to compare male progeny from fertilized females to males from unfertilized females and to compare males and females from fertilized females. Male progeny of virgin mothers had significantly longer durations of active immature stages and total egg-to-adult period than male progeny of fertilized females. Female progeny had significantly longer durations of egg incubation, active immature stages and egg-to-adult period than male progeny from fertilized mothers. Adult longevity was significantly greater in females than in males. Fertilized females produced significantly more eggs per day and overall than virgin females. The results of this study suggest that fertilization status of L. dipsacivagus females can affect both their own fecundity and the development of their male progeny.
