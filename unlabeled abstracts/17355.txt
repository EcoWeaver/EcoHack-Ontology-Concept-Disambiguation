Translocation of rare plant species to restore Garry oak ecosystems in western Canada: challenges and opportunities
Covering just 2000 ha, Garry oak ecosystems (GOEs) in western Canada contain about 10% of the Species at Risk Act listed species at risk in Canada, including 30 plants listed by Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as endangered. Since European settlement ca. 1840, GOE sites have been largely degraded by human disturbance, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, overgrazing, and fire suppression. A key strategy to mitigate this loss of biodiversity is to translocate rare plants to GOE restoration sites. The Garry Oak Ecosystem Recovery Team provides advice on proposed translocations but strongly encourages restoration practitioners to focus on plant populations already present on a site. There is a need for a closer look at challenges and opportunities afforded by translocation. If the approach taken is too precautionary, some rare species in this highly threatened ecosystem may be jeopardized. Current translocation efforts are being spearheaded by Parks Canada for golden paintbrush (Castilleja levisecta Greenm.), seaside birds-foot lotus (Lotus formossimus Greene), and white-top aster (Aster curtus Cronq.). Translocations like these together with further research on the genetics and ecology of rare plant species are critical to species recovery efforts within GOE and other similarly compromised ecosystems.
