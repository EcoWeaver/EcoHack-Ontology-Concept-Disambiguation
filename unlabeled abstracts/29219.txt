Interactions between chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii) and introduced predators: a review
The chuditch is a carnivorous marsupial that has suffered catastrophic decline since European settlement in Australia. The impacts of introduced foxes and feral cats are thought to have contributed to this decline. Although chuditch populations appear to respond favourably to fox control, ecological theory predicts that other predators, including feral cats, are also likely to increase in abundance when foxes are removed. The flow-on effects of these predicted increases are not known, but are potentially significant for chuditch and for other native fauna. Here, we review the evidence for limiting effects of foxes and feral cats on chuditch populations. We also discuss the likely effects on chuditch populations (direct and indirect) of current fox control practices. Using recent advances in carnivore community ecology, we make testable predictions regarding likely interactions within the predator guild. Experiments should adopt a whole-of-community approach, seeking to clarify the effects of fox control on the entire suite of native and introduced predators, as well as on the abundance and diversity of prey.
