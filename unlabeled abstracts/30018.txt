Seed characteristics of the invasive alien vine Vincetoxicum rossicum are affected by site, harvest date, and storage duration
The alien vine Vincetoxicum rossicum (Kleopow) Barbar. (Asclepiadaceae) is a major concern in natural areas of the Lower Great Lakes Basin. Reproduction in this perennial occurs largely by polyembryonic seeds that mature from August to November. Many seeds produced in autumn germinate the following spring, but the germinability of seeds produced in late summer is unknown. The influence of parent plant light environment on seed characteristics in this species is also poorly understood. We examined the characteristics of V. rossicum seeds harvested in late August and early November 2002 from three habitats in central New York State, USA, differing in light availability. Site had a significant effect on seed weight and germination percentage, but not on the number of embryos germinating per seed or radicle length. Seeds produced in the shaded habitat in August weighed significantly more and had lower germin ability than seeds produced in an adjacent open habitat, but this was not observed in a second open habitat. The probability of germination decreased with seed size for seeds ranging from 2 to 8 mg. For the open sites, fresh seeds produced in August had approximately double the germination percentages of those produced in November. However, for all sites, germination following 18 weeks of cold storage was greatest for seeds harvested in November. The probability of multiple embryos germinating was influenced by seed weight. The nature of this relationship varied by site, but not by harvest date or storage duration. Larger seed size resulted in longer total radicle length after 7 d, regardless of site.Key words: Cynanchum rossicum, maternal environment, pale swallowwort, polyembryony, resource allocation, seed dormancy.
