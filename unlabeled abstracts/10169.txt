A complete history of the establishment of Japanese sika deer on the Delmarva Peninsula: 100 years post-introduction
While many non-native species immediately express their negative qualities which encourage their management (even attempted eradication), some have long lag periods before the population begins to grow out of control. Sika deer have been problematic in many places where they were introduced as novelties or games species through hybridization or aggressive interactions with native deer. In attempt to better manage these species we need to know their native ecosystem. We provide evidence through summarized literature of the manner in which sika deer arrived on Delmarva from Yakushima Island in Japan via a multi-generational stopover in the United Kingdom. We also add morphological and genetic support that confirm the origins and help describe the path of introduction of sika deer to Maryland. We also summarize the growth and change in population size(s) over the last 100 years. This historic understanding is an essential part of coping with the persistent growth of a large, aggressive herbivore that is currently being managed as a game species. We summarize the possible impacts of sika deer including the displacement of native white-tailed deer. The management of this species needs to be carefully observed as they continue to spread throughout the critical saltmarsh of the Delmarva Peninsula.
