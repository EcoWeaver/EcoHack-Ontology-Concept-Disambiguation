Contribution of native phosphorous-solubilizing bacteria of acid soils on phosphorous acquisition in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.).
The present investigation analyzes the in vitro P solubilization [Ca-P, Al-P, Fe(II)-P, and Fe(III)-P] efficiency of native PSB strains from acid soils of Odisha and exploitation of the same through biofertilization in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) growth and P acquisition. One hundred six numbers of soil samples with pH <= 5.50 were collected from five districts of Odisha viz., Balasore, Cuttack, Khordha, Keonjhar, and Mayurbhanj. One bacterial isolate from each district were selected and analyzed for their P solubilization efficiency in National Botanical Research Institute Phosphate broths with Ca, Al, and Fe-complexed phosphates. CTC12 and KHD08 transformed more amount of soluble P from Ca-P (CTC12 393.30 mg/L; KHD08 465.25 mg/L), Al-P (CTC12 40.00 mg/L; KHD08 34.50 mg/L), Fe(III)-P (CTC12 175.50 mg/L; KHD08 168.75 mg/L), and Fe(II)-P (CTC12 47.40 mg/L; KHD08 42.00 mg/L) after 8 days of incubation. The bioconversion of P by all the five strains in the broth medium followed the order Ca-P > Fe(III)-P > Fe(II)-P > Al-P. The identified five strains were Bacillus cereus BLS18 (KT582541), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CTC12 (KT633845), Burkholderia cepacia KHD08 (KT717633), B. cepacia KJR03 (KT717634), and B. cepacia K1 (KM030037) and further studied for biofertilization effects on peanut. CTC12 and KHD08 enhanced the soil available P around 65 and 58% and reduced the amount of each Al(3+) about 79 and 81%, respectively, over the uninoculated control pots in the peanut rhizosphere. Moreover, all tested PSB strains could be able to successfully mobilize P from inorganic P fractions (non-occluded Al-P and Fe-P). The strains CTC12 and KHD08 increased the pod yield (114 and 113%), shoot P (92 and 94%), and kernel P (100 and 101%), respectively, over the control. However, B. amyloliquefaciens CTC12 and B. cepacia KHD08 proved to be the potent P solubilizers in promoting peanut growth and yield.
