A spatial linkage between dams and non-native fish species in Hokkaido, Japan
Abstract - The native and non-native freshwater fish species richness as well as the proportion of native fish species to overall fish species were examined to test a hypothesis of a spatial linkage between the distributions of dams and non-native fishes based on survey data collected in rivers and streams in Hokkaido, Japan. Non-native fish species have steadily increased in Hokkaido since the mid 1970s, as indicated by the decreasing proportion of native fish species per fish survey. Non-native species richness was significantly higher in areas above dams (i.e., reservoirs and their inlet streams) compared to areas without dams. As a result, the proportion of native fish species was lower above dams. This proportion was lower in developed and agricultural areas compared with forest areas, although both native and non-native species richness were higher in areas with development and agriculture. Non-native cyprinids, catfish and snakehead occurred primarily in a particular river basin with the largest drainage area, the longest history of reclamation and highest human population in the island. Non-native salmonids on the other hand, occurred in forest areas at higher elevations and their occurrence was associated with the existence of dams. There was a spatial linkage between the distribution of dams and non-native species, although it was applicable only to salmonids. The management of dams and reservoirs needs a strategy to prevent further expansion of exotic salmonids such as rainbow and brown trout. These species can be a significant threat to native Japanese salmonids as a result of various biological mechanisms.
