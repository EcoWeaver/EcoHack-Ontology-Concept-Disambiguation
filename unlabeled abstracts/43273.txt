The geography of crushing: Variation in claw performance of the invasive crab Carcinus maenas
The major claws of predatory, durophagous decapods are specialized structures that are routinely used to crush the armor of their prey. This task requires the generation of extremely strong forces, among the strongest forces measured for any animal in any activity. Laboratory studies have shown that claw strength in crabs can respond plastically to, and thereby potentially match, the strength of their prey's defensive armor. These results suggest that claw strength may be variable among natural populations of crabs. However, very few studies have investigated spatial variation in claw strength and related morphometric traits in crabs. Using three geographically separate populations of the invasive green crab in the Gulf of Maine, we demonstrate, for the first time, geographic variation in directly measured claw crushing forces in a brachyuran. Despite variation in mean claw strength however, the scaling of claw crushing force with claw size was consistent among populations. We found that measurements of crushing force were obtained with low error and were highly repeatable for individual crabs. We also show that claw mass, independent of a linear measure of claw size, and carapace color, which is an indicator of time spent in the intermoult, were important predictors of claw crushing force.
