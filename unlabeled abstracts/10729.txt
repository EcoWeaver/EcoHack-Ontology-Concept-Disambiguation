Patterns of Stem Photosynthesis in Two Invasive Legumes (Spartium junceum, Cytisus scoparius) of the California Coastal Region
Stem assimilation of Spartium junceum and Cytisus scoparius was measured over diurnal cycles during four time periods of 1992 in California. Spartium junceum plants were growing at an inland, coastal mountain site while the C scoparius plants were growing at a coastal bluff habitat. Both species had positive stem assimilation that resulted in approximately 200 mmol m-2 day-1 carbon dioxide accumulation. Daily carbon gain decreased from spring to fall for S. junceum due to a decrease in shoot water potential. Although C scoparius had the same relationship between assimilation and shoot water potential as that of S. junceum, carbon gain and water potential did not decrease during the year for C. scoparius. The major limitation for carbon gain of C scoparius was light intensity because the coastal site was characterized by lower temperature, higher humidity, and more fog than the inland site. Although these species grew in habitats that had a different vapor pressure and temperature, the assimilation response to vapor pressure was similar between the species. Water use efficiency was higher and intercellular carbon dioxide was lower for S. junceum compared to C. scoparius. Although the leaves of both species are ephemeral, the canopy has a constant positive carbon balance because of stem assimilation. The constant carbon gain throughout the year, from stem assimilation, may enhance the growth capacity of these invasive species in disturbed habitats.
