Experiences with invasive plant management and ecology in Alberta
A number of invasive plant management strategies, including competition, fertilizer, herbicide, combination of fertilizer and herbicide, biological control, mowing, grazing management, prevention, eradication and education have been investigated and employed in Alberta. The integrated weed management (IWM) strategies are overlapping, interconnected and based on ecological principles. Research on several invasive plant species, including ox-eye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare Lam.), scentless chamomile [Tripleurospermum perforatum (Merat) Lainz] and white cockle [Silene pratensis (Raf.) Godr. & Gren.] has provided ecological information showing the importance of maintaining healthy, competitive plant communities.
