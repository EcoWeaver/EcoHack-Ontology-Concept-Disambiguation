Gyrodactylus proterorhini in its non-native range: distribution and ability to host-switch in freshwaters
Successful co-introduction of a parasite and its host relies not only on presence of the parasite on host individuals in the founder population but also on the ability of both host and parasite to persist in the new area. Gyrodactylus proterorhini (Monogenea) has been successfully co-introduced with its Ponto-Caspian goby hosts (Babka gymnotrachelus, Neogobius fluviatilis, Neogobius melanostomus, Ponticola kessleri, Proterorhinus semilunaris) to many freshwater systems in Europe and is now widely distributed over four large European river basins (Danube, Rhine, Scheldt and Vistula). Within Europe, higher infection levels are documented in sites further from the native host range. In North America, however, G. proterorhini appears to be absent. Host specificity of G. proterorhini tested under natural conditions showed accidental host-switching onto local fish species (native Perca fluviatilis and non-native Perccottus glenii) in the river Vistula. Further examination of host-switching under experimental conditions, however, showed that G. proterorhini were unable to survive on non-gobiid hosts longer than 24 h. Our results indicate extremely low potential for host-switching of introduced G. proterorhini to non-gobiid hosts, at least in the freshwater systems of Central and Western Europe.
