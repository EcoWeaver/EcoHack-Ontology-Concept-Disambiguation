Temperature and salinity tolerances of Stage 1 zoeae predict possible range expansion of an introduced portunid crab, Charybdis japonica, in New Zealand
The successful invasion of a non-native species depends on several factors, including initial colonization and establishment of a self-sustaining population. Populations of the non-native paddle crab Charybdis japonica were first recognized in the Waitemata Harbour, Auckland, New Zealand in 2000, most likely arriving in ballast waters of an Asian merchant vessel. A survey completed in 2003 found C. japonica throughout the Waitemata Harbour, and further sampling in 2009 has revealed several well established populations in estuaries up to 70km from the putative invasion point. As the potential for further establishment of C. japonica beyond this area may depend on the temperature and salinity tolerances of their free swimming larvae, we quantified the survival of newly-hatched Stage 1 C. japonica zoeae subjected to temperatures ranging from 11 to 43degC or salinities from 5 to 45%0 in the laboratory. Upon hatching, replicate C. japonica zoeae were directly transferred from 21degC and 34.6%0 seawater to either an experimental temperature or salinity level. Behaviour and death rates of the larvae were monitored over a 24h period in the absence of food. Comparisons of zoeal survival rates to historical sea surface temperatures and salinities show that C. japonica Stage 1 zoeae tolerate a broad range of temperatures and salinities and could survive natural conditions throughout New Zealand. This gives C. japonica the potential to invade many other New Zealand estuaries and harbours. Keywords Charybdis japonica -Invasive-Stage 1 zoeae-New Zealand-Temperature-Salinity
