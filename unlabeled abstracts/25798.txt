Assessing genetic variation and population structure of invasive North American beaver (Castor Canadensis Kuhl, 1820) in Tierra Del Fuego (Argentina)
The North American beaver (Castor Canadensis) was introduced into Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, Argentina in 1946 as a potential source of wild fur. The species showed high growth potential, reaching close to 100,000 individuals from an original founding stock of 25 females and 25 males. Beavers adapted rapidly to their new environment and became invasive, providing an excellent model of successful adaptation of introduced populations to a new habitat. In this study, we used polymorphic mitochondrial (mt) DNA to evaluate genetic variation in the introduced beaver population from Tierra del Fuego. Nucleotide variation in partial sequences of Cytochrome b (500bp) and 12S rRNA (421bp) genes and the main non-coding D-loop region (521bp) were analyzed. Our study allowed to identify 10 different mtDNA lineages in the invasive population, none of them shared among the source populations. The pattern observed is a consequence of cessation of gene flow following expansion of the founding beaver population since the time of its introduction. This approach contributes to the understanding of effects of genetic changes on survival ability and reproductive success of invasive species. It also has important management implications to invasive species.
