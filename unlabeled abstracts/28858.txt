Structure and dynamics of an invasive population of the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in a Mediterranean wetland
This study analyzes the population structure and dynamics of an invasive population of Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852) in a Mediterranean wetland using the Bhattacharya's and Von Bertallanfy's analytical methods. The main purpose was to collect biological data necessary for the management of this nuisance species. A maximum of five age classes were identified for both sexes, three of which being composed of a few or zero individuals. Age classes were classified into two subgroups--spring (SpL) and summer (SuL) lines--on the basis of the different hatching periods. Individuals of SpL showed a faster growth rate and reached a larger body size than those belonging to SuL, probably because they were able to grow for a longer time. No between-sex differences were found in growth patterns except for the asymptotic length (L), which was reached faster by the females. Other population properties were analyzed, such as a high mortality rate, a maximum longevity of 4 years, and a low mean life-time (<12 months). Finally, a relatively small fraction of individuals seemed to survive after the first reproductive peak in spring. Consequently, the structure and dynamics of the study population seem to reveal its stability and spreading potential, as a confirmation of the invasiveness of P. clarkii in Mediterranean wetlands.
