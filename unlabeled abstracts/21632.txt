First record of Phyllorhiza punctata von Lendenfeld, 1884 (Cnidaria: Scyphozoa, Mastigiidae) in Mexico
The Australian spot jellyfish Phyllorhiza punctata has not been recorded previously for any coast of Mexico. A giant jellyfish was recorded for the first time in June 2006 in Laguna de Mandinga, southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Between 2007 and 2008, another three adult specimens were collected and later in May 2009 and April-June 2010 a great number of juveniles and adults were observed, of which 142 were collected. The presence of juveniles and adults throughout five consecutive years indicates that the species has a seasonal pattern. It migrates from the Sistema Arrecifal Veracruzano (SAV) into Laguna de Mandinga during the spring, aided by the tide that flows along the estuary of the Jamapa River. The population then decreases at the end of the summer, during the rainy season, when salinity decreases (10 psu). The recruitment area of the polyps is probably associated with the coral reefs in the SAV.
