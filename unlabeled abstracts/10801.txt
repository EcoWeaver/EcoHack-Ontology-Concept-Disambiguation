Nutrient enrichment increases plant biomass and exotic plant proportional cover independent of warming in freshwater wetland communities
Anthropogenic environmental change can increase exotic species performance and reduce native biodiversity. Nutrient enrichment may favor exotic plants with higher growth rates. Warming may increase the performance of exotic species from warmer native ranges and/or decrease the performance of locally adapted native species. However, community level impacts of nutrient enrichment and warming may depend on their combined effects on individual species and species interactions. We conducted a factorial 11-month field experiment that manipulated 1) plant origin: native, exotic (species from warmer and nutrient rich habitats), or native-&-exotic; 2) nutrients: ambient or high; and 3) temperature: ambient, +1 degC, or +2 degC. Elevated nutrients increased biomass and exotic plant proportional cover. Exotic diversity was higher with elevated nutrients. Native and exotic biomass responses to elevated nutrients were smaller in native-&-exotic treatments. Elevated nutrients increased the relative abundance of two exotic and decreased one exotic and three native species in native-&-exotic treatments. The predicted exotic to native biomass ratio was higher than the observed ratio, indicating that native plants reduced the potential growth of exotic plants in native-&-exotic treatments. Warming had no effect on plant biomass or diversity. These results suggest that nutrient enrichment increases the performance of some exotic plants and that it is critical to consider native and exotic plant interactions when assessing anthropogenic factor and exotic plant effects on native plant communities.
