Has the invasive mongoose Herpestes javanicus yet reached the island of Taveuni, Fiji?
The Fijian island of Taveuni is being proposed as a potential World Heritage Site because much of its flora and fauna, including many endemic species, remains intact. The greatest threat facing Taveuni's wildlife is a potential incursion by the invasive small Indian mongoose Herpestes javanicus from nearby islands, and anecdotal reports have suggested that the mongoose may already be present. To determine if mongooses were present on Taveuni 40 traps were set in two locations close to the main ports of entry, in typical mongoose habitat. Normally mongooses are easily caught if they are present, but in 204 trap nights none were captured, although eight feral cats and 11 rats were caught. None of the 31 people questioned from around the island had seen the mongoose. A list of seven recommendations is provided for a management strategy to prevent any possible incursion by mongooses and to eradicate any arrivals at the earliest opportunity.
