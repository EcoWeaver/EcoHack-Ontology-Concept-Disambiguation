Fishes from the Edge of Victoria Falls, Africa: Demise of a Physical Barrier for Downstream Invasions
Samples of fishes from the edge of Victoria Falls (Zambia-Rhodesia) were utilized in explaining the history of exchanges between two fish faunas and the invasion of Lake Kariba. Fishes of the pre-Upper Zambezi River are of a different origin from those in the pre-Middle and Lower Zambezi. When the two separate river systems which now make up the Zambezi were united as a result of a tectonic upwarp, the point of unification became the Victoria Falls. The rushing waters of the river cut steep gorges along the fault lines in the basalt lava. The Falls were considered a physical barrier separating fishes of the Upper and Middle Zambezi. Recent environmental changes which accompanied the creation of man-made Lake Kariba, together with the invasion of the lake by Upper Zambezi fishes, demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the Falls as a downstream barrier. A theory of an ecological barrier caused by differences in habitat and by differences in number of available niches is presented here. This ecological barrier was functional for 500,000 years, when the separate rivers first united.
