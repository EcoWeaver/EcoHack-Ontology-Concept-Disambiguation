Different longitudinal distribution patterns of native white-spotted charr and non-native brown trout in Monbetsu stream, Hokkaido, northern Japan
Abstract  This study focused on longitudinal distribution patterns of native white-spotted charr and non-native brown trout in a mountainous stream in Hokkaido, Japan. Brown trout ratio, which is the proportion of brown trout in the catch of salmonids, was decreasing from downstream to upstream. Brown trout ratio correlated negatively with water temperature. Thus, our results suggested that temperature may influence the possible competition between native white-spotted charr and non-native brown trout.
