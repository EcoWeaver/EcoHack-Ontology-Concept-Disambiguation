Determining non-invasiveness in ornamental plants to build green lists
1. Ornamental horticulture is the most important pathway for plant invasions world-wide. Large numbers of non-native plants are used as ornamentals, and current policies fail to effectively address the continued escape of species from cultivation. Legislative measures are often limited to the listing of few high-risk species banned from sale or planting. This approach, however, may give the impression that non-listed species are not considered to be a risk and are therefore safe to use. The continued widespread use of species not yet identified as having the risk to become invasive may create a problem in the future.
