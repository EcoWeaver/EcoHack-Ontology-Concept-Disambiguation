The Role of Species Traits (Invasiveness) and Ecosystem Characteristics (Invasibility) in Grassland Invasions: A Framework1
A framework was created based on the results of two experimental studies on invasiveness and invasibility. It shows us that grassland ecosystems are more invasible if the availability of nitrogen and light is high, whereas high aboveground biomass and high species richness reduce their invasibility. To restrict invasions, increasing the species richness of grasslands seems to be an appropriate management practice. A combined study of invader and ecosystem traits is needed to successfully predict invasions.
