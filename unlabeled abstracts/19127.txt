Cydippid ctenophores in the coastal waters of Svalbard: is it only Mertensia ovum?
Threat of potential arrival of non-indigenous species is increasing, particularly in the high Arctic, due to ecological shifts expected from climate change and increasing shipping traffic, facilitating long-distance transport of invaders. Hence, knowledge on the species present currently is crucial to assess the potential ecological impact of the non-indigenous species in the future. Ctenophores, and gelatinous zooplankton generally, are poorly known due to identification challenges and lack of systematic monitoring programmes. Yet, they are known to play important roles in the world's ocean ecosystems and share physiological attributes making them exploit the changing environmental conditions better compared to most other zooplankton groups. Here, we report the co-occurrence of Mertensia ovum, Euplokamis sp. and an unidentified mertensiid-like species in the high Arctic, in the Svalbard archipelago region, based on a combination of morphological and molecular identification methods. This is a valuable first step toward establishing a baseline for future ecological studies, monitoring of climate impacts and assessing the threat of introduced species in the high Arctic.
