Development and characterization of 15 microsatellite loci fromLycorma delicatula(Hemiptera: Fulgoridae)
Lycorma delicatula (White 1845), which has been recently introduced into Korea, is a notorious pest on grapes. This invasive insect has rapidly spread throughout central and southern Korea. To date, we have no behavioral or population genetics information, such as invasion routes and subsequent dispersal rates in Korea, to help understand and control populations of L. delicatula. Here, we have developed 15 novel microsatellite loci for L. delicatula. The isolated loci were polymorphic, with 2 to 19 alleles in 42 individuals from a single population in Korea. The analyses revealed that all 42 individuals had different multilocus genotypes with heterozygosity ranging from 0.214 to 0.866. Eleven of the 15 loci did not deviate significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The isolated markers will facilitate population genetic studies of L. delicatula.
