The daily and seasonal behaviour of the American mink and the coypu, two invasive species from the Zahorie PLA (Slovakia)
The activity of small invasive mammals, the American mink (Neovison vison) and the coypu (Myocastor coypus), was monitored in western part of Slovakia. Camera traps were located at 9 localities where these animals occur and were monitored throughout all four seasons. The activity of these two invasive species was analysed with regard to the habitat type and environment and, but especially, to the relationship to season, daily period, part of the day and activities. The following animal activities were observed: environmetal exploration, movement, swimming, stationary, grooming, play, fee, feeding, change of environment, mating behaviour and territorial marking. In case of the coypu, crepuscular and nocturnal activities were prevalent. Activity during daytime occurred mostly during winter days with low temperatures. On the other hand, American minks were mostly diurnal. The shift in behaviour compared to American minks in their native environment could be a sign of its adaptation to a new environment. Our research also showed seasonal changes in activity of both invasive mammals. This research could serve as a basis for management schemes to combat the presence and dispersal of these two invasive mammal species.
