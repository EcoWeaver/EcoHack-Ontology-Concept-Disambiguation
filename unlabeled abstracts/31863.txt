Assessment of genetic diversity of Korean native pig (Sus scrofa) using AFLP markers
In order to assess the genetic diversity and genetic relationships among the six commercial pig breeds including the Korean native pig, we performed an amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. Applying the three EcoRI/TagI primer combinations to 54 individual pig samples out of six breeds, a total of 186 AFLP bands were generated, 67 (36%) of which were identified as polymorphic bands. From these polymorphic bands, the three estimates (percentage of polymorphic loci, Neis heterozygosity and Shannon index) of genetic diversity, G(ST) estimates, Neis unbiased genetic distance and two indices of genetic similarity were calculated. From all the calculations of genetic diversity, the lowest genetic diversity was exhibited in the Korean native pig, and the highest in the Chinese Yanbian pig. Given the mean G(ST) value (G(ST) = 0.390) across all pigs examined, levels of apparent breed subdivision were considerable. A UPGMA tree of individuals based on Jaccards similarity index showed that the Korean native pig formed a distinct cluster from the other five pigs. In addition, the tree displayed that all the individuals except for six individuals were grouped into their breeds. Principal component analysis based on the binary data matrix of either presence or absence confirmed the distinctness of the Korean native pig from the other pigs. Our results indicate that the Korean native pig has a low level of genetic diversity and is distinct from the five pig breeds, confirming the results from previous microsatellite data. The findings also suggest that AFLP analysis may be a valuable tool for revealing genetic relationships and genetic diversity among different pig breeds.
