Conquerors or exiles? Impact of interference competition among invasive Ponto-Caspian gammarideans on their dispersal rates
Ponto-Caspian gammarids have invaded European waters, affecting local communities by predation and competition. Their ranges and dispersal rates vary across Europe, which may result from their interspecific interactions, accelerating or reducing migrations. We checked this hypothesis by testing interference competition among co-occurring invaders: Dikerogammarus villosus, D. haemobaphes and Pontogammarus robustoides. We used 140-cm long tanks (gravel substratum), divided into seven compartments. We introduced 25 "residents" into the outermost compartment, separated with a barrier. After 1h, we introduced 25 "intruders". After the next 1h, we removed the barrier and the gammarids dispersed in the tank. After 4 or 20h, we counted the gammarids in the compartments. We tested all pairwise species combinations and single-species controls. Dikerogammarus villosus displaced other species (P. robustoides only after 4h) and reduced its own motility after 20h in their presence. Pontogammarus robustoides stimulated the short-time migrations of D. villosus intruders and of D. haemobaphes. As P. robustoides migrated spontaneously much more than Dikerogammarus spp., its impact decreased after longer time. Dikerogammarus haemobaphes stimulated the short-time movement of P. robustoides intruders but reduced the long-time relocation of this species. In general, gammarid dispersal increased in the presence of stronger competitors (D. villosus and P. robustoides, especially residents) and decreased in response to weaker competitors (D. haemobaphes). Thus, competitive interactions may affect dispersal of invasive gammarids and contribute to the fastest spread of the weakest competitor, D. haemobaphes observed in the field, whereas the strongest species, D. villosus was the latest newcomer in many novel areas.
