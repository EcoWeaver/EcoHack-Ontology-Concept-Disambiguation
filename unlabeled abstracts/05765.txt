Moderate genetic drift is driven by extreme recruitment events in the invasive mollusk Crepidula fornicata
Effective population size (Ne) is a measure of genetic drift and is thus a central parameter in evolution, conservation genetics and invasion biology. Interestingly, in native marine species, Ne is typically several orders of magnitude lower than the census size. This pattern has often been explained by high fecundity, variation in reproductive success and pronounced early mortality, resulting in genetic drift across generations. Data documenting genetic drift and/or Ne in marine invasive species are, however, still scarce. We examined the importance of genetic drift in the invasive species Crepidula fornicata by genotyping 681 juveniles sampled during each annual recruitment peak over nine consecutive years in the Bay of Morlaix (Brittany, France). Observed variations in genetic diversity were partially explained by variation in recruitment intensity. In addition, substantial temporal genetic differentiation was documented (that is, genetic drift), and was attributed to nonrandom variance in the reproductive success of different breeding groups across years in the study species. Using a set of single-sample and temporal estimators for Ne, we estimated Ne to be three or four orders of magnitude smaller than the census size (Nc). On one hand, this reduction in Ne relative to Nc appeared congruent with, although slight higher than, values commonly observed in native marine species. Particular life-history traits of this invasive species may play an important role in buffering genetic drift. On the other hand, Ne still remained far below Nc, hence, possibly reducing the efficiency of selection effects.Heredity advance online publication, 27 April 2016; doi:10.1038/hdy.2016.24.
