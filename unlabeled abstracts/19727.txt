Characterization of 21 microsatellite loci from the invasive Mediterranean gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus)
It is crucial to understand the dispersal potential of invasive species to predict how biological invasions spread. Molecular data can provide unique insights into sources, routes, and mechanisms of invasion. Twenty-one microsatellite markers were developed for the Mediterranean gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus), a species native to southwest Asia that has successfully invaded much of the southern US. The loci were characterized with geckos collected from two locations at Texas A&M University. Eighteen of the 21 loci exhibited polymorphism (2-8 alleles/locus). Both gecko populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Our preliminary screen detected significant population structure at a small scale (650 m). Therefore, these markers will be useful to assess dispersal at varying geographic ranges.
