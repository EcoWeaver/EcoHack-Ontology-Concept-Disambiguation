Is biotic resistance to invaders dependent upon local environmental conditions or primary productivity? A meta-analysis
Biotic resistance is an important component to limiting the spread of invasive plants into native communities. However, under certain conditions native plants may also facilitate invasion, a process identified as biotic assistance. Identifying the conditions that associate with resistance and assistance is needed to better understand the factors driving species invasion.
