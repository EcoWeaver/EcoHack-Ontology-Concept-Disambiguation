Natural regeneration in exotic tree plantations in Hong Kong, China
Tree plantations consisting mostly of a single exotic species have been established in Hong Kong, South China, for reforesting degraded lands since the 1950s. In this study, natural woody plant regeneration success under different types of closed-canopy plantations (Acacia confusa, Lophostemon confertus, Melaleuca quinquenervia and mixed-plantings) and natural secondary forests in the central New Territories were assessed. A total of 79 tree species, 64 shrubs and 23 woody climbers were recorded in 16 20mx20m plantation plots. Stem density of woody plant regeneration was similar among all sites, ranging from 9031 to 10,950stems>0.5m in height per hectare. Multivariate analysis of understorey species composition showed that there were consistent differences between plantation types. Lophostemon plantations generally had poor native plant colonization in comparison with natural secondary forests and other types of plantations. These differences between forest types can be at least partly attributed to pre-existing site conditions, since the tree species planted were matched to the site. Native woody plant colonization was poor on sites isolated from natural seed sources. Plantation understories were generally dominated by a few species of bird-dispersed shrubs, suggesting that enrichment planting with poorly dispersed shade-tolerant native tree species will be needed to facilitate regeneration in those plantations where natural regeneration is inadequate.
