Effects of seawater temperature increase on economically relevant native and introduced clam species
As a consequence of climate change, global warming is expected to increase during the 21st century. Taking this into account, the impact of rising temperatures on the native R. decussatus and introduced R. philippinarum bivalve species was assessed, through biochemical and mRNA expression analyses. Our findings showed that at 21 degC, the electron transport system and antioxidant enzymes activities, as well as the expression of Hsp70 gene were induced in R. decussatus when compared with 17 degC. On the other hand, at 25 degC, results suggested that R. decussatus closed their valves during short periods, probably as a behavioral strategy, downregulating the expression of genes associated with mitochondrial metabolism (Cox-1 and 16S) and molecular chaperone (Hsp70) compared with organisms at 17 degC. In addition, the introduced species (R. philippinarum) increased the electron transport system and antioxidant activities, as well as gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and molecular chaperone (Hsp70) at 21 degC. However, antioxidant mechanisms may not have been enough to prevent together lipid membrane damages at 21 degC. At 25 degC, R. philippinarum presented increased electron transport system and antioxidant mechanisms, as well as the expression of genes associated with apoptosis regulation and molecular chaperone. Overall, the present findings indicate that in a global warming scenario both species are able to induce different mechanisms to mitigate the impacts of temperature increase.
