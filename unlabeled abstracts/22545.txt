Effects of sublethal copper exposure on two gammarid species: which is the best competitor?
Biomarker responses in organisms exposed to copper were examined by comparing two gammarid species, Gammarus roeseli and Dikerogammarus villosus, based on gender. G. roeseli specimens were exposed to 20 mg/L of copper for 6, 12, 24 and 48-h periods, while D. villosus were exposed to 20 and 30 mg/L of copper for 12, 48 and 72 h. Males and females of each species were exposed separately and biomarker measurements were performed for each species and gender. The selected biomarkers were antioxidant enzymes as total glutathione peroxidase (GPxtot), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (SeGPx), and catalase activities. Malondialdehyde level (MDA) was measured as a biomarker of toxic effect. Energy reserves were evaluated by means of lipid, glycogen and protein levels. For both species and gender, antioxidant enzyme activities were weakly modified by copper exposure and differences were transient. MDA levels were increased in both species and genders in exposed animals compared to controls, when energy reserves were decreased. G. roeseli was more rapidly overwhelmed by copper toxicity while the first response of D. villosus was the mobilization of its energetic content. D. Villosus probably has specific physiological properties that enable it to cope with copper toxicity and thus become the best competitor.
