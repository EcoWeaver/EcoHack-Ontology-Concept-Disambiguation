Bridging information domains to improve ecological understanding of biological invasions in a marine ecosystem
Bioinvasions are widely recognized as a growing threat to marine ecosystems, but our ability to predict future invasions and develop control measures is hampered by a lack of timely and accessible information. Although scientific research and traditional ecological monitoring programs amass information on the spread and impact of introduced species, there are other domains in which valuable information on marine invasive species exist. The problem is that actors within the various domains may be guided by different objectives and investigative approaches, creating barriers to information sharing and effective application. We present a practical method for integrating information on two marine invasive species collected using three different approaches: standardized ecological monitoring, online reporting databases, and surveys of anglers and crabbers. Focusing on two recently introduced species with different characteristics, the Asian shore crab (Hemigrapsus sanguineus) and Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis), in the Hudson-Raritan watershed of New York and New Jersey, we used sensitivity analyses to explore the relative contribution of each information source to our knowledge of species abundance and distribution. By demonstrating that data integration can produce an image of the invasion process that would not have emerged had we used any one method individually, our results provide evidence for the advantages of an interdisciplinary approach. For multifaceted problems such as bioinvasions that require swift action without having complete information, researchers and practitioners may need to supplement standard scientific method with other information domains in order to amplify detectability of marine pests at an early stage when populations are still small and manageable.
