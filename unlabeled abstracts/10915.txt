Isolation and characterization of highly polymorphic microsatellite markers from the marine invasive species Crepidula fornicata (Gastropoda: Calyptraeidae)
Many marine organisms have pelagic larvae and these are often important agents of dispersal and establishment of exotic species. The larval phase and the hermaphroditic reproductive system of the invasive marine gastropod Crepidula fornicata are crucial in determining the success of this species along the European coasts. To analyse these factors, we developed seven microsatellite loci specific to C. fornicata. On the same set of individuals, the microsatellite loci exhibited a greater level of polymorphism than previously studied allozyme markers and, thus, will permit fine-scale analysis and larval pool studies.
