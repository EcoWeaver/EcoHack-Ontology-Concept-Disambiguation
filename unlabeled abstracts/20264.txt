The relationship between invasive alien species and main climatic zones
Analysis of numbers of invasive species (insects, plants, plant diseases) in each of Chinese provinces and the world's climatic zones respectively, demonstrated positive correlations between diversity of bioinvasion and air temperature and precipitation (the two main criteria for classifying world climate types). When the air temperature is within the range of 1-25degC, the degree of diversity of invasive alien species increases exponentially with air temperature. However, when the air temperature falls outside the range of 1-25degC, the diversity of harmful invasive alien species changes with air temperature in a parabolic pattern, showing a "mid-latitude bulge". Namely, when air temperatures are too high or too low, a lower average invasion frequency of harmful alien species is observed. Invasion by harmful invasive alien species is more weakly related to precipitation. Different climatic zones showed dramatic differences in resistance to the invasion of invasive alien species due to their different characteristic climatic factors, mainly including air temperature and precipitation.
