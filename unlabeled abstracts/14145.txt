Liste preliminaire des Abeilles de Saint-Barthelemy (Antilles francaises) et leurs relations avec la flore butinee (Hymenoptera : Apoidea : Megachilidae, Apidae)
Preliminary checklist of bees from St. Barthelemy (French West Indies) and their relations with visited flowers (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Megachilidae, Apidae). An annotated checklist of bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila), excluding Halictidae, is compiled for St Barthelemy, an island located in the Lesser Antilles of the eastern Caribbean. The list has eight species, including three exotic species to the Caribbean, four others known only from the Caribbean and three that occur both on mainland and the West Indies. The list is constituted with data from literature and from our field researches carried out by Karl Questel between 2006 and 2013. A list of visited flowers, along with ecological notes for each species is also given.
