Population genetics of the invasive giant hogweed (Heracleum sp.) in a northern European region
Heracleum mantegazzianum is a successful invader in many European countries. Besides its impact on biodiversity, it represents a health hazard because of its phototoxic sap. Population genetic studies may help to predict which species are most likely to become invasive. In this study, we investigated the population genetic variation and structure of Heracleum sp., identified as H. mantegazzianum in Finland, i.e., within its northern range of distribution, using microsatellite markers. Our aims were to reveal the genetic characteristics and evolutionary processes that have resulted in observed patterns. The amount of genetic variation measured as expected heterozygosity was modest (mean H E = 0.406), which may be due to relatively small founder populations and/or inbreeding (mean F IS = 0.268). Mean allele numbers per population ranged from 2.0 to 4.7. The pairwise F ST values were generally high, and the mean F ST among all populations equalled 0.498. Based on F ST values, populations were significantly differentiated from each other, indicating restricted gene flow among the populations. The Bayesian structure analysis provided additional information on population genetic structure. The analysis divided the eight populations into two main clusters. Genetic analyses indicate that H. mantegazzianum has been introduced to Finland multiple times. Distinct population genetic patterns indicate that human-mediated dispersal is important.
