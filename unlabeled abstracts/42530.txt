Regional Vulnerability Assessment of Invasive Alien Plants in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province
This study was conducted to develop an environmental index for assessing the vulnerability of areas with invasive alien plants. To that end, "Regional Vulnerability Numerical Index" (RVNI) was developed with a spatial statistical technique and applied to Seoul and Gyeonggi-do area first. The results are as follows. First, RVNI was high in stream areas. Second, RVNI was lowest in mountain areas. It indicates that stream areas are vulnerable to invasive alien plants. In terms of regions, Guri City is most vulnerable and Gapyeong-gun is the least vulnerable. To expand and manage the invasive alien plants, a control protocol should be developed by considering the physiology and ecology by invasive alien plant. Also, related policies should be pursued based on the results. Thus, the findings of this study can be used as baseline data for setting policies for invasive alien species management.
