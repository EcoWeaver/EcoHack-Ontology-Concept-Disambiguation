Diversity of Bugulidae (Bryozoa, Cheilostomata) colonizing artificial substrates in the Madeira Archipelago (NE Atlantic Ocean)
Until very recently the Madeira Archipelago registered a total of eight Bugulidae species. In the present study we include descriptions of seven Bugulidae species, now with Scanning Electron Microscopy images, with four new records for the Archipelago: Bugulina fulva and Bugulina simplex for Madeira Island and Bugula neritina and Crisularia gracilis for the neighbouring Island of Porto Santo. Furthermore, we report the correction of the previous identification of Bugulina calathus minor earlier reported from Funchal harbour in 1998, now as Bugulina flabellata. This study is part of an ongoing monitoring program for detecting non-indigenous species in all marinas from the Madeira archipelago, between 2007 and 2015. Specimens were collected in previously deployed PVC settling plates, marina pontoons, and also on recreational hull vessels while performing dry dock inspections at a local shipyard. Our study reveals that the Madeira archipelago now registers a total of ten Bugulidae species, contributing therefore to the total bryozoan fauna of the Archipelago, now with more than 100 records. These numbers could increase, as Madeira is considered to be a "hotspot" for bryozoan diversity when compared to other nearby regions. Finally, hull fouling is considered as the most likely vector of introduction for the non-indigenous species of Bugulidae detected in Madeira. http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s10152-016-0465-8
