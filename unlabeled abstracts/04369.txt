Diversity and evolutionary genetics of the three major Plasmodium vivax merozoite genes participating in reticulocyte invasion in southern Mexico
Abstract Background Reported malaria cases in the Americas had been reduced to about one-half million by 2012. To advance towards elimination of this disease, it is necessary to gain insights into how the malaria parasite is evolving, including the emergence, spread and persistence of new haplotypes in affected regions. In here, the genetic diversity of the three major P. vivax merozoite genes was analyzed. Methods From P. vivax-infected blood samples obtained in southern Mexico (SMX) during 2006-2007, nucleotide sequences were achieved for: the 42 kDa carboxyl fragment of the merozoite surface protein-1 (msp1 42 ), domains I-II of the apical membrane antigen-1 (ama1 I-II ), and domain II of the Duffy binding protein (dbp II ). Gene polymorphism was examined and haplotype networks were developed to depict parasite relationships in SMX. Then genetic diversity, recombination and natural selection were analyzed and the degree of differentiation was determined as FST values. Results The diversity of P. vivax merozoite genes in SMX was less than that of parasites from other geographic origins, with dbp II
