Red Crabs in Rain Forest, Christmas Island: Biotic Resistance to Invasion by an Exotic Snail
A widely held view is that biotic resistance to invasion on oceanic islands is weak. On Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, the endemic red crab (Gecarcoidea natalis) and the introduced giant African snail (Achatina fulica) showed inverse patterns of abundance along gradients from disturbed habitat to intact rain forest: empty, but intact snail shells were abundant in disturbed habitat and rare in adjacent rain forest, while red crabs were abundant in rain forest and uncommon in disturbed habitat. The proportion of total snail shells that had been damaged by red crabs was much greater in rain forest. When snails were transplanted and tethered in both habitats, 97% were killed by red crabs in rain forest after 48 h, while in disturbed habitat only 22% of snails were killed by red crabs and the introduced fire ant (Solenopsis geminata). These results suggest that an endemic omnivore may restrict the distribution of an invader and that biotic resistance to invasion in undisturbed habitats can be strong on some islands.
