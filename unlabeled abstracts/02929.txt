The tomato borer, Tuta absoluta, invading the Mediterranean Basin, originates from a single introduction from Central Chile
AbstractThe Lepidopteran pest of tomato, Tuta absoluta, is native to South America and is invasive in the Mediterranean basin. The species' routes of invasion were investigated. The genetic variability of samples collected in South America, Europe, Africa and Middle East was analyzed using microsatellite markers to infer precisely the source of the invasive populations and to test the hypothesis of a single versus multiple introductions into the old world continents. This analysis provides strong evidence that the origin of the invading populations was unique and was close to or in Chile and probably in Central Chile near the town of Talca in the district of Maule.
