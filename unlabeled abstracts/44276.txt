Invasive Plant Species (Weed) Challenge in Conservation in Australia
Invasive plants are a nuisance to native ecosystem in Australia causing environmental degradation. Once purposely introduced plant species to the landscape for horticulture and agriculture. Nearly 10% of this naturalized pool of species has become serious invaders now with the capacity to supersede native vegetation. This exotic invasion coupled with anthropogenic climate change has aggravated the natural ecosystem setting. Several management strategies and legislative measures to minimize the impact on native biodiversity were also examined with some suggestions added for weed management.
