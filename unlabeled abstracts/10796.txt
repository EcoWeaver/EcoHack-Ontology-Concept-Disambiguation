The Invasion of a South-Western Australian River System by Perca fluviatilis: History and Probable Causes
A survey conducted among freshwater anglers indicated that during the 1980s Perca fluviatilis L. rapidly invaded the middle and lower reaches of the Murray River, Western Australia. This exotic species was previously confined to the upper reaches of the river system for almost 70 years. The invasion appears to have been accomplished mainly through downstream diffusion, but some translocation may also have taken place. Failure to colonize the middle and lower river prior to the 1980s may have been due to competitive exclusion by trout. In addition, downstream dispersal by perch was probably favoured by increasing upstream salinities and assisted by a major summer flood. The high fecundity, flexible behaviour, and physiological adaptations of P. fluviatilis to the receiving environment fit it well into the model of Arthington & Mitchell (1986) of successful fish invaders. The invasion of the Murray River by redfin perch is an example of how a change in environmental circumstances can lead to a sudden and rapid expansion in the range of a species of previously limited distribution.
