Parasitoid Recruitment to the Globally Invasive Chestnut Gall Wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus
The chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus is a global pest of chestnut (Castanea). Established as a pest in the mid 20th century in Japan, Korea and the USA, this species has now reached Europe. Successful deployment of a biocontrol agent, Torymus sinensis, in Japan has led to its early release in Italy. Here we provide the first overview of the natural enemies associated with D. kuriphilus in its native and invaded ranges, and discuss general patterns in community development. We then use what is known about European oak gall wasp communities to predict possible future developments for D. kuriphilus, and possible interactions between parasitoid communities attacking hosts on chestnut and oaks.
